## 🎯 Introduction

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

A Geographical Indication (GI) is a sign used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities, reputation, or characteristics that are essentially attributable to that place of origin. GI protection is important for preserving traditional products, protecting community rights, and promoting regional development. India has a rich heritage of GI products, and the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999, provides a comprehensive framework for their protection.
