## 🎯 Introduction

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Compulsory licensing is a mechanism that allows the government to authorize the use of a patented invention by a third party without the patent owner's consent. This powerful tool balances the exclusive rights of patent owners with public interest considerations, particularly access to essential goods like medicines. The Patents Act, 1970, contains detailed provisions on compulsory licensing that reflect India's commitment to both promoting innovation and ensuring public welfare.

## 🎯 Conclusion

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Compulsory licensing is critical tool for balancing patent rights with public interest, particularly ensuring access to essential medicines. The Natco v. Bayer case demonstrated India is willing to use this tool effectively when patented drugs are unaffordable or unavailable.

**4 Key Lessons:**
1. Patent rights are not absolute
2. Public health can override exclusive rights
3. TRIPS flexibilities can be used effectively
4. Reasonable compensation still provided

For developing countries like India, compulsory licensing remains essential safeguard to ensure patent protection doesn't come at cost of access to life-saving medicines. Natco case serves as model for how this balance can be achieved in practice.
