## ✍️ Answer:

### 🎯 Introduction

Compulsory licensing is a mechanism that allows the government to authorize the use of a patented invention by a third party without the patent owner's consent. This powerful tool balances exclusive patent rights with public interest, particularly access to essential medicines. The Patents Act, 1970, contains detailed provisions on compulsory licensing that reflect India's commitment to both promoting innovation and ensuring public welfare.
