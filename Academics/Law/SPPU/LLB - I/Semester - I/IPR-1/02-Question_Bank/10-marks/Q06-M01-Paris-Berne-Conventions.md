### 🏭 Paris Convention (1883)

**📋 Coverage:** Patents, Trademarks, Industrial Designs

**📅 Adopted:** 1883  
**🌍 Members:** 170+ countries  
**🇮🇳 India Joined:** December 7, 1998

---

#### 4 Key Principles of Paris Convention

**🎯 Mnemonic: "NPIU"**
- **N** - National Treatment
- **P** - Priority Rights
- **I** - Independence of Patents
- **U** - Unfair Competition Protection

---

##### Principle 1️⃣: 🌍 National Treatment (Cornerstone)

**📜 Definition:**

Each member country must grant same protection to foreign nationals as it grants to own nationals.

**3 Aspects of Equal Treatment:**
- **Same procedures**
- **Same rights**
- **Same remedies**

**✅ Example:** German inventor in India = Treated same as Indian inventor.

**⚡ Importance:** Prevents discrimination, ensures equal treatment, facilitates international trade.

**❌ Without This:** Countries could discriminate against foreigners → International IP protection ineffective.

---

##### Principle 2️⃣: ⏱️ Right of Priority (Most Practical)

**📜 Definition:**

File in one member country → Can file in other member countries within specified period → Claim first filing date as priority date.

**2 Priority Periods:**

**Period 1: 🔬 Patents & Utility Models**
- **12 months** priority period

**Period 2: ™️ Trademarks & Designs**
- **6 months** priority period

---

##### 🔄 How Priority Works (Example)

**📅 Jan 1, 2024:** File patent in India

**⏱️ Until Jan 1, 2025 (12 months):** Can file in other Paris Convention countries

**✅ Benefit:** Applications in other countries treated as if filed on Jan 1, 2024

**🛡️ Protection:** Publications/applications by others during 12 months won't affect your application

---

##### 4 Benefits of Priority Rights

**🎯 Mnemonic: "ASDF"**
- **A** - Assess commercial potential (time to evaluate)
- **S** - Secure funding (time to arrange)
- **D** - Decide countries (which markets to enter)
- **F** - (Prepare) Foreign translations/documentation

**💡 Without losing priority date to competitors/publications.**

---

##### Principle 3️⃣: 🔀 Independence of Patents

**📜 Definition:**

Patents in different countries are independent of each other.

**3 Aspects of Independence:**

**1. No Obligation:**
Grant in one country ≠ obligation to grant in others.

**2. No Automatic Effect:**
Refusal/revocation in one ≠ affects patents in others.

**3. Own Standards:**
Each country examines per its own laws.

**✅ Example:** Patent granted in USA can be refused in Japan if doesn't meet Japanese standards. Patent revoked in Germany ≠ affects validity in France.

**💡 Rationale:** Different countries have different examination standards, industrial needs, public policy. Independence allows appropriate decisions per circumstances.

---

##### Principle 4️⃣: 🛡️ Protection Against Unfair Competition

**3 Protected Against:**

**1. 🤥 False Indications:**
False source/origin of goods.

**2. ⚠️ Misleading Claims:**
About nature/characteristics of goods.

**3. 🎭 Confusion:**
Other acts creating confusion/misleading public.

---

#### 🌟 4 Significance Points

**1. 🏆 First Major Treaty:** Set precedent for international IP cooperation
**2. 🌍 Wide Membership:** 170+ countries
**3. 💼 Facilitates Trade:** Easier global protection
**4. 🇮🇳 India Benefits:** Joined 1998, integrated into global system

---

### 📚 Berne Convention (1886)

**📋 Coverage:** Copyright - Literary & Artistic Works

**📅 Adopted:** 1886 (Bern, Switzerland)  
**🌍 Members:** 180+ countries  
**🇮🇳 India:** Member since 1928

---

#### 6 Key Principles of Berne Convention

**🎯 Mnemonic: "NAIMIR"**
- **N** - National Treatment
- **A** - Automatic Protection
- **I** - Independence of Protection
- **M** - Minimum Standards
- **I** - (Moral Rights under Art. 6) Integrity
- **R** - (Paternity under Art. 6bis) Recognition

---

##### Principle 1️⃣: 🌍 National Treatment

Same as Paris Convention - foreign works get same protection as domestic works.

**✅ Example:** American novel in India = Same protection as Indian novel.

---

##### Principle 2️⃣: ✨ Automatic Protection (Revolutionary)

**📜 Core Feature:**

Copyright protection is **automatic** - exists from moment of creation and fixation.

**3 No-Formality Rules:**

**1. ❌ No Registration Required:**
Copyright exists immediately upon creation.

**2. ❌ No Copyright Notice (©) Necessary:**
Though advisable, not required.

**3. ❌ No Other Formalities:**
No deposit, fees, or compliance needed.

**✅ Example:** Write a poem → Copyright exists immediately. No registration or © notice needed for protection.

**📜 Contrast with Earlier Systems:**

Before Berne, many countries required registration/deposit/notices. These formalities often resulted in loss of rights. Berne eliminated these barriers.

**💡 Revolutionary:** Removed all formalities - unprecedented!

---

##### Principle 3️⃣: 🔀 Independence of Protection

Protection in country of origin independent of protection in other countries.

**⚠️ However:** If not protected in origin country → Others not obligated to protect.

---

##### Principle 4️⃣: 📏 Minimum Standards of Protection

**3 Categories of Minimum Standards:**

---

**Category 1: ⏱️ Duration (Life + 50 years)**

**2 Term Types:**

**Type 1:** Life of author + **50 years** (most works)

**Type 2:** **50 years** from publication (anonymous, pseudonymous, cinematographic)

**🇮🇳 India:** Provides life + **60 years** (more than minimum).

- **T** - Translation
- **P** - Public performance
- **B** - Broadcasting
- **A** - Adaptation

---

##### Principle 5️⃣ & 6️⃣: 🎭 2 Moral Rights (Article 6bis)

**🎯 Mnemonic: "AI"**
- **A** - Attribution (Paternity)
- **I** - Integrity

---

**Moral Right 1: ✍️ Attribution (Paternity)**

Right to be identified as creator of work.

**Moral Right 2: 🛡️ Integrity**

Right to object to modification/distortion harming honor/reputation.

---

**3 Important Features of Moral Rights:**

**1. 💫 Remain with Author:**
Even if economic rights sold.

**2. 🎭 Protect Reputation:**
And connection to work.

**3. 🌏 Cultural Significance:**
Important in civil law countries, reflects personality theory.

**✅ Example:** Sell painting to museum → They cannot modify it misrepresenting your artistic vision, even though they own physical painting.
