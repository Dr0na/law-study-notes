## 🏭 Paris Convention for Protection of Industrial Property (1883)

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Coverage:** Patents, Trademarks, Industrial Designs

**Adopted:** 1883 | **Members:** 170+ countries | **India Joined:** December 7, 1998

### 4 Key Principles:

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Principle 1: National Treatment (Cornerstone)**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Each member country must grant same protection to foreign nationals as it grants to own nationals.

**Practical Example:** German inventor in India = Treated same as Indian inventor (same procedures, same rights, same remedies).

**Importance:** Prevents discrimination, ensures equal treatment, facilitates international trade.

**Without This:** Countries could discriminate against foreigners → International IP protection ineffective.

</div>

<br>

**Principle 2: Right of Priority (Most Practical)**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

File in one member country → Can file in other member countries within specified period → Claim first filing date as priority date.

**2 Priority Periods:**
- **Patents & Utility Models:** 12 months
- **Trademarks & Designs:** 6 months

**How It Works:**

Example: File patent in India on Jan 1, 2024 → Until Jan 1, 2025 (12 months), can file in other Paris countries → Applications treated as if filed on Jan 1, 2024 → Publications/applications by others during 12 months won't affect your application.

**4 Benefits (Mnemonic: "ASDF"):**
- **A** - Assess commercial potential (time to evaluate)
- **S** - Secure funding (time to arrange)
- **D** - Decide countries (which markets to enter)
- **F** - Foreign translations/documentation (time to prepare)

**Without losing priority date to competitors/publications.**

</div>

<br>

**Principle 3: Independence of Patents**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Patents in different countries are independent of each other.

**3 Aspects:**
- Grant in one country ≠ obligation to grant in others
- Refusal/revocation in one ≠ affects patents in others
- Each country examines per own laws

**Example:** Patent granted in USA can be refused in Japan if doesn't meet Japanese standards. Patent revoked in Germany ≠ affects validity in France.

**Rationale:** Different countries have different examination standards, industrial needs, public policy considerations.

</div>

<br>

**Principle 4: Protection Against Unfair Competition**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**3 Protected Against:**
- False indications of source/origin of goods
- Misleading claims about nature/characteristics
- Other acts creating confusion/misleading public

</div>

</div>

### Significance:

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

- First major international IP treaty
- Wide membership (170+ countries)
- Facilitates global trade
- India benefits since 1998 joining

</div>

## 📚 Berne Convention for Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1886)

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Coverage:** Copyright - Literary & Artistic Works

**Adopted:** 1886 (Bern, Switzerland) | **Members:** 180+ countries | **India:** Member since 1928

### 6 Key Principles:

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Principle 1: National Treatment**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Same as Paris - foreign works get same protection as domestic works.

**Example:** American novel in India = Same protection as Indian novel.

</div>

<br>

**Principle 2: Automatic Protection (Revolutionary)**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Copyright protection is **automatic** - exists from moment of creation and fixation.

**3 No-Formality Rules:**
- ❌ No registration required (copyright exists immediately)
- ❌ No copyright notice (©) necessary (though advisable)
- ❌ No other formalities (no deposit, fees, or compliance needed)

**Example:** Write a poem → Copyright exists immediately. No registration or © notice needed.

**Contrast with Earlier Systems:** Before Berne, many countries required registration/deposit/notices. These formalities often resulted in loss of rights. Berne eliminated these barriers.

**Revolutionary Feature:** Removed all formalities - unprecedented!

</div>

<br>

**Principle 3: Independence of Protection**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Protection in country of origin independent of protection in other countries.

**However:** If not protected in origin country → Others not obligated to protect.

</div>

<br>

**Principle 4: Minimum Standards of Protection**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Duration:** Life of author + **50 years** (most works) OR **50 years from publication** (anonymous, pseudonymous, cinematographic)

**India:** Provides life + **60 years** (more than minimum).

**Works Covered (6 Types - Mnemonic: "LMADCO"):**
- **L** - Literary | **M** - Musical | **A** - Artistic | **D** - Dramatic | **C** - Cinematographic | **O** - Other creative works

**Rights Protected (5 Types - Mnemonic: "RTPBA"):**
- **R** - Reproduction | **T** - Translation | **P** - Public performance | **B** - Broadcasting | **A** - Adaptation

</div>

<br>

**Principles 5 & 6: 2 Moral Rights (Article 6bis - Mnemonic: "AI")**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Moral Right 1: Attribution (Paternity)**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Right to be identified as creator of work.
</div>

**Moral Right 2: Integrity**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Right to object to modification/distortion harming honor/reputation.
</div>

**3 Important Features:**
- Remain with author even if economic rights sold
- Protect reputation and connection to work
- Cultural significance in civil law countries

**Example:** Sell painting to museum → They cannot modify it misrepresenting your artistic vision, even though they own physical painting.

## 🎯 Conclusion

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Paris and Berne Conventions established fundamental principles continuing to govern international IP protection.

**Paris Convention:** 4 principles (NPIU) - Industrial property focus, Priority rights (12M patents, 6M trademarks), Independence of patents

**Berne Convention:** 6 principles (NAIMIR) - Copyright focus, Automatic protection (revolutionary), Moral rights (attribution + integrity)

These laid groundwork for subsequent developments including TRIPS. They demonstrate how international cooperation can balance creators' interests, business needs, and public welfare while respecting national sovereignty.

For India, membership crucial for:
- Global economic integration
- Attracting foreign investment
- Protecting Indian creators internationally
- Shaping IP laws and policies
