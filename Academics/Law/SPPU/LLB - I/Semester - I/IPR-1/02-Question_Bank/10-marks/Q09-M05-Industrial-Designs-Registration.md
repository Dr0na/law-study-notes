## 🎯 Introduction

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

An industrial design refers to the ornamental or aesthetic aspect of an article - essentially how a product **looks** rather than how it **functions**. The Designs Act, 2000, replaced the earlier Designs Act, 1911, modernizing India's design protection system and aligning it with international standards, particularly the TRIPS Agreement.

## 🎨 Concept of Industrial Design

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

### Legal Definition (Section 2(d)):

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

"Design" means only the features of **shape, configuration, pattern, ornamentation or composition of lines or colours** applied to any article by industrial process, which appeal to and are judged solely by the **eye**.
