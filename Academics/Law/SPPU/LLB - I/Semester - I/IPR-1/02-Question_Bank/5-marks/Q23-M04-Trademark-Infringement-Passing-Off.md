## 📋 8 Key Differences

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Difference 1: Legal Basis**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Infringement:** Statutory right under Trade Marks Act, 1999 (Section 29)

**Passing Off:** Common law right based on tort of misrepresentation

</div>

<br>

**Difference 2: Registration Requirement**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Infringement:** Trademark must be **registered** for infringement action

**Passing Off:** **No registration required** - can be brought for unregistered marks

</div>

<br>

**Difference 3: What Must Be Proved**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Infringement:** Only need to prove:
- Registered trademark exists
- Defendant using identical/similar mark
- For identical/similar goods

**Passing Off:** Must prove **3 elements (Classic Trinity):**
- **Reputation/Goodwill:** Plaintiff's mark has reputation
- **Misrepresentation:** Defendant's use misrepresents connection
- **Damage:** Likelihood of damage to plaintiff

</div>

<br>

**Difference 4: Ease of Proof**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Infringement:** **Easier to prove** - registration certificate is prima facie evidence

**Passing Off:** **Harder to prove** - must establish reputation, misrepresentation, and damage with evidence

</div>

<br>

**Difference 5: Scope**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Infringement:** Protection limited to goods/services for which mark is registered (and similar goods/services)

**Passing Off:** Can potentially cover broader range if reputation extends beyond registered goods

</div>

<br>

**Difference 6: Well-Known Marks**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Infringement:** Well-known marks get protection even for dissimilar goods (Section 11(2), Section 29(4))

**Passing Off:** Protection depends on proving actual likelihood of confusion/deception

</div>

<br>

**Difference 7: Remedies**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Infringement:** Statutory remedies under Sections 134-135 (injunction, damages, accounts, delivery up)

**Passing Off:** Common law remedies (injunction, damages)

</div>

<br>

**Difference 8: Defenses**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Infringement:** Defenses include: honest concurrent use, prior use, trademark invalidity, use of own name/address, generic use

**Passing Off:** Defenses include: no misrepresentation, no likelihood of confusion, mark is descriptive/generic, laches (delay)

</div>

</div>

## 📖 Can Both Actions Coexist?

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Yes!** Owner of registered trademark can sue for both:
- **Infringement** (statutory action)
- **Passing off** (common law action)

Often both are pleaded alternatively in same suit for comprehensive protection.

</div>

## ✅ Examples

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Trademark Infringement:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
"Nike" is registered trademark for shoes. Someone sells shoes with "Nike" mark → Infringement (registration certificate proves rights).
</div>

**Passing Off:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Local restaurant "Taj" has reputation (but not registered). New restaurant opens as "Taj Palace" → Can sue for passing off if proves reputation, misrepresentation, damage (even without registration).
</div>

</div>

## 🎯 Conclusion

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Trademark infringement (statutory right requiring registration, easier to prove) and passing off (common law right for unregistered marks, requires proof of reputation/misrepresentation/damage) are complementary mechanisms for protecting trademark rights. Registered trademark owners have advantage of statutory infringement action, but even unregistered marks with reputation can be protected through passing off. The choice between them depends on whether mark is registered and the specific facts of each case.
