## 🆚 Distinction from Copyright

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Copyright:**
- Protects original creative work itself
- Belongs to author/creator
- Example: Songwriter owns copyright in musical composition

**Neighbouring Rights:**
- Protect performances and productions of works
- Belong to performers, producers, broadcasters
- Example: Singer owns rights in their specific performance of song

**Both can coexist:** Recorded song has multiple layers - copyright in composition (composer), copyright in lyrics (lyricist), neighbouring rights in performance (singer), neighbouring rights in sound recording (producer).

Neighbouring rights recognize that performers, producers, and broadcasters invest time, money, and creativity in making works available to the public. They deserve protection for their contributions even though they may not be the original creators.
