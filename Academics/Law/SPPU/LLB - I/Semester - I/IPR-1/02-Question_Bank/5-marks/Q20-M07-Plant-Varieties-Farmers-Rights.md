## 📖 Background

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**TRIPS Article 27.3(b)** requires members to provide protection for plant varieties either by:

- Effective sui generis system, OR
- Combination of both

**Why:** To balance breeders' rights with farmers' rights and traditional knowledge protection.

## 🎯 Conclusion

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

The PPV&FR Act, 2001, is a pioneering legislation that uniquely balances plant breeders' rights with farmers' rights. Unlike typical plant variety protection systems (like UPOV), it recognizes farmers as innovators and conservers, granting them rights to save, use, exchange, and even sell farm produce. This balance reflects India's agricultural realities, where millions of small farmers depend on saved seeds. The Act promotes innovation in plant breeding while protecting farmers' traditional practices and ensuring they share in benefits when their varieties are used in commercial breeding.
