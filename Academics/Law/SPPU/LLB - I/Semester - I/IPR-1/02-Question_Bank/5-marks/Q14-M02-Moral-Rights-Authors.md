## 📋 2 Main Moral Rights

---

### Right 1: Right of Paternity (Right of Attribution)

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

The author has the right to:

**1. Claim Authorship:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Claim authorship of the work.
</div>

<br>

**2. Be Identified:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Be identified as the author when the work is used.
</div>

<br>

**3. Prevent False Attribution:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Prevent someone else from claiming to be the author.
</div>

**Practical Implications:**
- Author's name must appear on copies, in credits, in publicity
- Even if copyright is sold, author's name must be acknowledged
- Others cannot claim authorship

**Example:** If you write a screenplay and sell it to a studio, your name must appear in the film's credits. The studio cannot claim it wrote the screenplay.

### Right 2: Right of Integrity

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

The author has the right to:

**1. Prevent Distortion/Mutilation:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Prevent distortion, mutilation, or modification of the work.
</div>

<br>

**2. Object to Prejudicial Treatment:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Object to any treatment that would be prejudicial to their honor or reputation.
</div>

**Practical Implications:**
- Work cannot be altered in ways that harm author's reputation
- Colorization of black-and-white films, editing novels, changes to artworks may violate this
- Alteration must be prejudicial - minor edits may be acceptable

**Example:** If you paint a picture and sell it, the buyer cannot paint over parts or modify it misrepresenting your artistic vision or harming your reputation as an artist.

## 🎯 Conclusion

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Moral rights protect the personal and reputational interests of authors beyond economic considerations. They recognize that creative works embody the author's personality and identity. The two moral rights - attribution (being identified as author) and integrity (preventing harmful modifications) - remain with the author even after selling economic rights. This reflects the principle that creative works are expressions of the author's personality and deserve protection beyond mere economic exploitation.
