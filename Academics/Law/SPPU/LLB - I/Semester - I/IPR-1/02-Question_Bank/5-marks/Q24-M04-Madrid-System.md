## 🔄 How Madrid System Works (5 Steps)

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Step 1: Basic Application/Registration**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Must have trademark application or registration in home country (called "basic mark" in "Office of Origin").

**Example:** Indian company must first file trademark in India.
</div>

<br>

**Step 2: International Application**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
File one international application through home country's trademark office - designate countries where protection wanted - pay single set of fees.
</div>

<br>

**Step 3: WIPO Examination & Registration**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
WIPO examines formalities (not substantive) - registers in International Register - publishes in WIPO Gazette.
</div>

<br>

**Step 4: Notification to Designated Countries**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
WIPO notifies each designated country's trademark office.
</div>

<br>

**Step 5: National Examination**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Each country examines per own laws - if no objections → protected - if objections → can refuse (but may still be protected in other countries).
</div>

## ⚠️ Limitation: Central Attack

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

If, within 5 years of international registration, the basic application/registration in home country is refused, cancelled, or limited, then international registration automatically becomes invalid (to same extent) in all designated countries.

**However:** Applicant can "transform" international registration into national applications in designated countries, maintaining original filing date.
