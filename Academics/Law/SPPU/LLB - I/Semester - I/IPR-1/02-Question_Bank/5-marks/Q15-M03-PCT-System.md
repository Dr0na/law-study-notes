## 📖 Background

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Filing separate patent applications in many countries is expensive, time-consuming, and complex with different procedures in each country. The PCT provides a unified procedure for filing patent applications internationally.

**Established:** Patent Cooperation Treaty

**Administered by:** WIPO

**Members:** Over 150 countries (including India)

## 🔑 Key Features of PCT

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**1. Single International Application:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
File one application that has effect in all PCT member countries.
</div>

<br>

**2. International Search:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
International Searching Authority (ISA) conducts search and provides search report indicating relevant prior art.
</div>

<br>

**3. International Publication:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Application published internationally, typically 18 months after priority date.
</div>

<br>

**4. Optional International Preliminary Examination:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Applicant can request preliminary examination for opinion on patentability.
</div>

<br>

**5. National/Regional Phase:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Applicant decides in which countries to proceed and enters "national phase" in those countries.
</div>

</div>

## 📋 PCT Procedure (2 Phases)

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

### Phase 1: International Phase

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Month 0:** File PCT application with receiving office (can file in national patent office or directly with WIPO)

**Months 3-4:** International Search Report (ISR) and Written Opinion issued

**Month 18:** International publication by WIPO

**Months 22-28:** Optional International Preliminary Examination (if requested)

</div>

### Phase 2: National/Regional Phase

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Months 30-31:** Applicant decides which countries to enter, files translations, pays national fees

**Examination & Grant:** Each national/regional office examines per own laws and may grant or refuse patent

</div>

## ✅ 5 Benefits of PCT

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**1. Delayed Decision:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
30-31 months (vs. 12 under Paris) to decide which countries to enter - more time to assess commercial potential, secure funding, prepare translations.
</div>

<br>

**2. Early Search Report:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
ISR provides insight into patentability - helps decide whether to proceed, can amend claims based on report.
</div>

<br>

**3. Cost Savings:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Initial costs lower than filing separately - can delay major expenses until national phase - if search report negative, can abandon without incurring all national costs.
</div>

<br>

**4. Centralized Process:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Single application initially - uniform procedure for international phase - simplified filing.
</div>

<br>

**5. Flexibility:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Can amend application after search report - can narrow/broaden claims - can drop countries where prospects poor.
</div>
