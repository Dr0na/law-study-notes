# 📝 Question: Distinguish between Pre-Grant and Post-Grant Opposition under the Patents Act. (5 Marks)

# ✍️ Answer:

## 🎯 Introduction

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

The Indian Patents Act provides two opportunities for third parties to oppose the grant of a patent - before grant (pre-grant opposition) and after grant (post-grant opposition). These mechanisms allow public participation in ensuring that only valid patents are granted.

## 📋 6 Key Differences

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Difference 1: Timing**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Pre-Grant:** After publication of application but **before** patent is granted

**Post-Grant:** Within **12 months** from date of publication of grant of patent

</div>

<br>

**Difference 2: Who Can File**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Pre-Grant:** **Any person** (the law says "any person" - not just interested parties)

**Post-Grant:** **Interested person only** (person engaged in/promoting research in same field, manufacturing similar products, affected by grant)

</div>

<br>

**Difference 3: Form**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Pre-Grant:** Written representation (Form 7A) to Controller with evidence

**Post-Grant:** Representation (Form 7) to Controller with evidence

</div>

<br>

**Difference 4: Procedure**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Pre-Grant:**
- Opposition filed with Patent Office
- Applicant given opportunity to respond
- May include hearing
- Controller considers while deciding whether to grant

**Post-Grant:**
- **Opposition Board** constituted (Section 25(3))
- Board considers opposition, conducts hearings, examines evidence
- Controller makes decision based on Board's recommendation

</div>

<br>

**Difference 5: Anonymity**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Pre-Grant:** Opponent's name not disclosed until hearing (anonymous opposition possible)

**Post-Grant:** Opponent must be identified as "interested person"

</div>

<br>

**Difference 6: Effect**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Pre-Grant:** Can prevent grant of invalid patent - cheaper and faster than post-grant

**Post-Grant:** Patent already granted - opposition may lead to revocation, amendment, or maintenance

</div>

</div>

## 📜 Grounds for Opposition (Same for Both)

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Both pre-grant and post-grant oppositions can be filed on same grounds:

- Wrongfully obtained from opponent or true inventor
- Already published or publicly known/used before priority date
- Already claimed in another patent with earlier priority
- Obvious or lacks inventive step
- Not an invention or not patentable under Act
- Insufficient or unclear description
- Failure to disclose information regarding foreign applications
- Not filed within 12 months from convention country
- Failure to disclose or incorrect mention of source/origin of biological material
- Anticipated by traditional knowledge

</div>

## ✅ Advantages and Uses

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Pre-Grant Opposition:**
- Cheaper and faster than post-grant
- Prevents grant of invalid patent
- Anonymous option
- No risk if patent already granted

**Post-Grant Opposition:**
- Can challenge already granted patent
- More formal procedure with Opposition Board
- 12-month window after grant

</div>

## 🎯 Conclusion

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Pre-grant and post-grant opposition are important mechanisms for ensuring patent quality in India. Pre-grant opposition (by any person, before grant, cheaper) and post-grant opposition (by interested persons, within 12 months of grant, more formal) provide different opportunities to challenge patents. These mechanisms allow public participation in the patent system, helping prevent grant or maintenance of invalid patents that don't meet patentability criteria or fall under Section 3 exclusions.
