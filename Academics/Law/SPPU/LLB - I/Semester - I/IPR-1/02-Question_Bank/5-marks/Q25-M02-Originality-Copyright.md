## 📜 What is Originality?

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

A work is considered original if it satisfies **3 requirements:**

**Requirement 1: Originates from the Author**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
The work must be author's own intellectual creation - not copied from someone else - created independently.
</div>

<br>

**Requirement 2: Involves Minimal Creativity**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Some minimal degree of creativity or skill required - threshold is low - even simple works can be original.
</div>

<br>

**Requirement 3: Not Merely Mechanical**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Purely mechanical or automated processes don't create original works - some human creative input necessary.

**Example:** Photograph taken by motion-triggered camera is not original, but one composed by photographer is.
</div>

## ❌ What Originality Does NOT Mean

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**NOT Novelty:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Work doesn't need to be new or unprecedented. Two people can independently create similar works - both original.
</div>

<br>

**NOT High Quality:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Artistic merit or quality irrelevant - even simple works can be protected.
</div>

<br>

**NOT Uniqueness:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Work doesn't have to be unique in the world - just independently created.
</div>

<br>

**NOT Invention:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Unlike patents, copyright doesn't require inventive step - much lower threshold.
</div>

</div>

## ✅ / ❌ Examples

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**✅ Original Works:**
- Photograph where photographer chose angle, lighting, composition
- Compilation of data arranged in specific, thoughtful order
- Translation involving creative choices
- Simple drawing reflecting artist's expression

**❌ Not Original:**
- Photocopy of existing document
- Mechanical recording without creative input
- Phone numbers arranged alphabetically (no creativity)
- Purely factual information without creative expression

</div>

## ⚖️ Landmark Case: Donoghue v. Allied Newspapers

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Facts:** Person had brilliant idea for story and communicated it to writer, who then wrote the story.

**Held:** Writer who "clothed the idea in form" (expressed it in tangible form) became author and owner of copyright. Person who provided idea had no rights.

**Principle:** Copyright exists not in ideas, but in tangible form in which ideas are expressed. Person who provides creative expression owns copyright.

</div>

## 🎯 Threshold: Low but Not Absent

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**"Sweat of the Brow" Not Sufficient:**

Modern copyright law requires **minimal creativity**, not just labor/effort.

**Example:** Phone directory with alphabetical listing = no creativity (just effort) = not original.

**But:** Database with creative selection/arrangement = original.

**Standard:** Low threshold - protects wide range of works, but some creativity required.

</div>

## 🎯 Conclusion

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Originality in copyright law means the work originates from the author and involves minimal creativity, not that it is novel, high quality, or unique. The low threshold for originality ensures that a wide variety of creative works receive copyright protection, from simple photographs to complex literary works. What matters is that the work is independently created with some degree of creative expression, not copied from others. This approach balances protecting creators' rights with ensuring that copyright doesn't extend to purely mechanical reproductions or factual information without creative expression.
