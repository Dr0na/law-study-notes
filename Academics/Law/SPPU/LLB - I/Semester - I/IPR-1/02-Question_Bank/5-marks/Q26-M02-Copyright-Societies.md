## 🎯 Purpose and Function

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

### Why Copyright Societies Exist:

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Individual copyright owners, especially music creators, cannot practically monitor and collect royalties for every use of their work. Copyright societies solve this problem.

**Example:** Restaurant plays music for customers. Instead of obtaining permission from each songwriter individually (impractical), restaurant obtains blanket license from copyright society, which distributes collected fees to members based on usage.

</div>

### 4 Main Functions:

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**1. Collective Administration:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Managing rights for numerous creators collectively.
</div>

<br>

**2. Licensing:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Issuing blanket licenses to users (radio stations, restaurants, streaming services).
</div>

<br>

**3. Collection:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
