## 📋 Key Steps in Patent Grant Procedure

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Step 1: Filing Application**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

File application with Patent Office (Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai):

**Two Options:**
- **Provisional Specification:** When invention not fully developed - establishes priority date - must file complete within 12 months (non-extendable)
- **Complete Specification:** Fully describes invention with claims - can be filed directly

**Key Forms:** Form 1 (Application), Form 2 (Specification), Form 3 (Foreign applications disclosure)

**Filing Date:** Date of filing = Priority date for patent

</div>

<br>

**Step 2: Publication (18 months)**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Applications automatically published 18 months from filing/priority date.

**Early Publication:** Can request early publication (Form 9) to speed up process.

**Effect:** Application becomes part of state of art, public can inspect.

</div>

<br>

**Step 3: Request for Examination (CRITICAL)**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Timeline:** Must file **within 48 months** from filing/priority date

**Form:** Form 18 with fees

**Who Can File:** Applicant or any interested third party

**⚠️ Critical:** If not filed within 48 months → Application **deemed withdrawn** (cannot be revived)

</div>

<br>

**Step 4: Examination**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Patent Examiner:
- Searches for prior art
- Examines for patentability (novelty, inventive step, industrial applicability)
- Checks compliance with formal requirements

**First Examination Report (FER):** Examiner issues FER stating objections, prior art citations, formal defects

</div>

<br>

**Step 5: Response to FER**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Timeline:** **12 months from FER** (non-extendable)

**Options:**
- File arguments explaining why objections invalid
- Amend specification/claims to overcome objections
- Request hearing before Controller

**⚠️ If No Response:** Application **deemed abandoned** (cannot be revived)

</div>

<br>

**Step 6: Grant or Refusal**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**If Objections Overcome:**
- Controller issues order for grant
- Applicant pays grant fees
- Patent sealed and granted
- Certificate of Patent issued (Form 24)
- Details published in Patent Office Journal

**If Objections Not Overcome:**
- Application refused
- Can appeal to Appellate Board (now High Courts)

</div>

<br>

**Step 7: Post-Grant Maintenance**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Annual Renewal Fees:** Starting from 2nd year after filing

**Working Statements:** Form 27 - must file annually if commercialized

**Failure to Pay Renewal:** Patent lapses (can be restored within 18 months for genuine oversight)

</div>

## 🎯 Conclusion

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

The patent grant procedure involves multiple stages from filing to grant, with critical deadlines that must be met. The most critical are: (1) Filing complete specification within 12 months if provisional filed, (2) Requesting examination within 48 months, and (3) Responding to FER within 12 months. Missing any of these deadlines results in loss of the patent application. The process can take 3-5 years from filing to grant, requiring patience and careful attention to procedural requirements.
