## 📋 10 Key Differences

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Difference 1: Ownership**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**GI:** Collective - belongs to all producers in the geographical region who meet standards

**TM:** Individual or company ownership - belongs to specific business entity

</div>

<br>

**Difference 2: Nature/Purpose**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**GI:** Indicates geographical origin - tells consumers where product comes from

**TM:** Indicates commercial source - tells consumers which business made product

</div>

<br>

**Difference 3: Transferability**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**GI:** **Cannot** be sold, transferred, or assigned - tied to geographical region

**TM:** **Can** be sold, assigned, or transferred - treated as property

</div>

<br>

**Difference 4: Function**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**GI:** Preserves traditional products, protects community rights, indicates quality linked to place

**TM:** Distinguishes goods/services of one business from others, builds brand identity

</div>

<br>

**Difference 5: Duration**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**GI:** Indefinite (renewable every 10 years) - as long as link to geography maintained

**TM:** Indefinite (renewable every 10 years) - as long as used and renewed

</div>

<br>

**Difference 6: Quality Link**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**GI:** Quality **essentially attributable** to geographical origin (natural/human factors)

**TM:** Quality associated with particular brand/business (not geography-dependent)

</div>

<br>

**Difference 7: Who Can Use**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**GI:** All authorized producers from geographical area can use (collective right)

**TM:** Only the owner or licensees can use (exclusive right)

</div>

<br>

**Difference 8: Licensing**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**GI:** Compulsory licensing **not permitted** under TRIPS

**TM:** Can be licensed to others (exclusive or non-exclusive licenses)

</div>

<br>

**Difference 9: Legal Framework**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**GI:** GI Act, 1999 (TRIPS Articles 22-24)

**TM:** Trade Marks Act, 1999 (TRIPS Articles 15-21)

</div>

<br>

**Difference 10: Examples**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**GI:** Darjeeling Tea, Basmati Rice, Kanchipuram Silk, Champagne, Scotch Whisky

**TM:** Tata, Nike, Coca-Cola, Apple, Google

</div>

</div>

## ⚖️ Can Same Sign Be Both GI and TM?

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Generally, no conflict if:

**Trademark existed first:** Registered in good faith before GI protected - trademark may be maintained (TRIPS Article 24)

**GI established:** If clear geographical indication with established use - new trademarks incorporating that GI may be refused

**Different goods/services:** May coexist if no confusion

</div>

## 🎯 Conclusion

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

While both GI and TM identify products, they differ fundamentally in ownership (collective vs. individual), nature (geographical origin vs. commercial source), and transferability (non-transferable vs. transferable). GI protects community rights and traditional products linked to geography, while TM protects individual business identity and brand value. Understanding this distinction helps choose appropriate protection for different types of products and ensures proper use of these intellectual property rights.
