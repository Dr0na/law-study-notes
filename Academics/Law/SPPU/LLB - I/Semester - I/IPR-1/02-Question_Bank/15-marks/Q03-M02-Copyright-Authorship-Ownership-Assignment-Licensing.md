- Transfer of ownership
- 7 strict requirements (WSITRPR): Writing, Signed, Identify, Territory, Rights, Period, Royalty
- Protects authors from unfair exploitation

**📌 Licensing:**
- Permission while retaining ownership
- 3 types (VSC): Voluntary, Statutory, Compulsory
- Voluntary: Exclusive vs. Non-exclusive
