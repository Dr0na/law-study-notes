# 📝 Question: Discuss in detail the provisions of the TRIPS Agreement and its impact on India's Intellectual Property laws. (15 Marks)

---

## ✍️ Answer:

### 🎯 Introduction

The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) is the most comprehensive international agreement on intellectual property. Adopted in 1995 as part of the Uruguay Round establishing the WTO, TRIPS represents a watershed moment in global IP protection.

TRIPS is unique because it **links IP protection with international trade** and provides **enforcement through WTO's dispute settlement** system - unlike previous IP treaties which lacked enforcement mechanisms.
