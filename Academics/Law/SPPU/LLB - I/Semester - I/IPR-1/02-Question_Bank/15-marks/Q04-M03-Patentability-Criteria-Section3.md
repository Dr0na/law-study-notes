## 🎯 Introduction

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Patents are exclusive rights granted to inventors for their inventions, providing them with the ability to prevent others from making, using, or selling the patented invention for a limited period (20 years). However, not every invention qualifies for patent protection. The Patents Act, 1970, establishes specific criteria that an invention must meet to be patentable and explicitly excludes certain categories of inventions from patentability. Understanding these criteria and exclusions is crucial for inventors, businesses, and legal practitioners.

## 📋 3 Criteria for Patentability

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

For an invention to be patentable under the Patents Act, 1970, it must satisfy three fundamental requirements.

</div>

---

### Criterion 1: Novelty (Newness)

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

#### Legal Requirement:

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

An invention is considered novel if it is **not part of the state of the art** - meaning it hasn't been disclosed to the public anywhere in the world before the filing date of the patent application.

</div>

#### Global Novelty Standard:

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

India follows the **absolute novelty** standard. Novelty is assessed on a **worldwide basis**. Even if an invention has been published in an obscure journal in a remote country, it can destroy novelty.

**Example:** If you invent a new type of solar panel, but someone in Germany published a similar design five years ago in a technical journal, your invention lacks novelty, even if you were unaware of that publication.

</div>

#### State of the Art Includes:

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

- Published patents from any country
- Scientific and technical journals and publications
- Books, magazines, conference papers
- Public demonstrations or exhibitions
- Prior use anywhere in the world
- Information available on the internet
- Any other form of public disclosure

</div>

#### 6 Acts That Destroy Novelty:

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**1. Publications by Anyone** (including inventor themselves)

**2. Public Demonstrations** (at exhibitions, unless within grace period)

**3. Sales or Offers** (commercial sales or offers for sale)

**4. Oral Presentations** (public speeches or lectures)

**5. Internet Publications** (any online disclosure)

**6. Prior Use** (anywhere in the world before filing)

</div>

#### Grace Period (12 Months):

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Indian law provides limited grace period for disclosures made:
- Before learned societies (scientific/technical societies)
- At government-approved exhibitions

**⚠️ However, best practice is to file BEFORE any public disclosure.**

</div>

</div>

---

### Criterion 2: Inventive Step (Non-Obviousness)

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

#### Legal Definition (Section 2(1)(ja)):

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

"Inventive step" means a feature of an invention that involves **technical advance** as compared to the existing knowledge or having **economic significance** or both, and that makes the invention **not obvious to a person skilled in the art**.

</div>

#### The Core Question:

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Would a person skilled in the art find the invention to be an obvious next step based on existing knowledge?

</div>

#### Person Skilled in the Art (4 Characteristics):

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**1. Ordinary Skill Level:** Has ordinary skill in relevant technical field (not genius, not novice)

**2. Access to All Information:** Has access to all published information (state of the art)

**3. Technically Competent:** Technically competent but not particularly creative

**4. No Inventive Research:** Would not undertake inventive research

</div>

#### What is "Obvious" vs. "Non-Obvious":

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Examples of Obvious (No Inventive Step):**
- Replacing wooden handle with plastic handle (straightforward material substitution)
- Making something bigger or smaller without unexpected advantage
- Combining two known devices in obvious manner without new technical effect

**Examples of Non-Obvious (Inventive Step Present):**
- Combining known elements producing surprising/unexpected result
- Solving long-standing problem experts tried and failed to solve
- Achieving result experts would not have predicted
- Discovering unexpected property of known substance

**Concrete Example:** Metal knobs corroding due to moisture → Replacing with plastic is obvious. BUT discovering that specific plastic formulation also has antibacterial properties (not previously known) = inventive step.

**⚠️ Important:** Courts must guard against "hindsight bias" - what seems obvious after invention may not have been obvious beforehand.

</div>

</div>

---

### Criterion 3: Industrial Applicability (Utility)

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

#### Legal Definition (Section 2(1)(ac)):

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

"Capable of industrial application" means that the invention is **capable of being made or used in an industry**.

**"Industry" broadly interpreted:** Manufacturing, Agriculture, Fisheries, Any other productive activity

</div>

#### 3 Key Requirements:

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**1. Must be Operative:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
The invention must actually work as claimed. Purely theoretical inventions not patentable. Perpetual motion machines rejected (violate natural laws).
</div>

<br>

**2. Must be Useful:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Must provide some benefit or solve some problem. Utility doesn't have to be groundbreaking - even minor improvements acceptable.
</div>

<br>

**3. Must be Reproducible:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Capable of being made or repeated by others. Patent specification must enable reproduction by person skilled in art. Fulfills social contract - disclosure for exclusivity.
</div>

</div>

</div>

---

## 🚫 Non-Patentable Inventions (Section 3)

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

While an invention may meet the three criteria above, Section 3 of the Patents Act explicitly excludes certain categories from patentability based on public policy, moral, and practical considerations.

</div>

---

## 💊 Section 3(d) - The Anti-Evergreening Provision ⭐⭐⭐

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**This is THE MOST IMPORTANT provision in Indian patent law for pharmaceuticals.**

### What Section 3(d) Says:

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

"The mere discovery of a new form of a known substance which does not result in the enhancement of the known efficacy of that substance..."

**Explanation:** Salts, esters, ethers, polymorphs, metabolites, pure form, particle size, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes, combinations and other derivatives of known substance shall be considered to be the same substance, **unless they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy**.

</div>

### Purpose:

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

To prevent **"evergreening"** - the practice of obtaining multiple patents on minor variations of the same drug to extend market exclusivity beyond the original 20-year patent term.

</div>

### 3 Key Elements of Section 3(d):

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Element 1: 12 Forms Presumed "Same Substance"**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Unless they differ significantly in efficacy, the following are considered same substance:

1. Salts | 2. Esters | 3. Ethers | 4. Polymorphs (crystal forms) | 5. Metabolites | 6. Pure form | 7. Particle size variations | 8. Isomers | 9. Mixtures of isomers | 10. Complexes | 11. Combinations | 12. Other derivatives

</div>

<br>

**Element 2: "Efficacy" = Therapeutic Efficacy**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

For pharmaceutical products, "efficacy" specifically means **therapeutic efficacy** - the ability to produce the desired therapeutic effect (ability to treat the disease).

</div>

<br>

**Element 3: Enhanced Efficacy Must Be Demonstrated**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Burden is on applicant to show **enhanced therapeutic efficacy** compared to the known substance.

</div>

</div>

### What is NOT Sufficient (5 Properties):

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**1. Improved Bioavailability:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
More drug absorbed into blood (but doesn't treat disease better)
</div>

<br>

**2. Better Stability:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Drug remains stable longer
</div>

<br>

**3. Improved Solubility:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Dissolves better in water
</div>

<br>

**4. Longer Shelf Life:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Lasts longer before expiry
</div>

<br>

**5. Easier Manufacturing:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Simpler to produce
</div>

**⚠️ Unless these improvements translate into enhanced therapeutic efficacy.**

</div>

### What IS Sufficient (4 Properties):

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**1. Significantly Better Treatment:** Drug treats disease more effectively

**2. Substantially Reduced Side Effects:** Much safer with fewer adverse effects

**3. Faster/Longer-Acting:** Significantly faster onset or longer duration of treatment effect

**4. Substantially Improved Outcomes:** Better patient recovery and health outcomes

</div>

## ⚖️ Landmark Case: Novartis v. Union of India (2013) ⭐⭐⭐

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

### Case Facts:

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**Drug:** Imatinib Mesylate (Cancer drug - Brand: Gleevec)

**Applicant:** Novartis AG (Swiss pharmaceutical company)

**Year:** 2013 (Supreme Court)

**What Novartis Claimed:** Patent for **beta crystalline form** of Imatinib Mesylate (already had patent on base form).

**Beta crystalline form had:**
- **30% better bioavailability** (more drug absorbed into blood)
- Better thermal stability
- Better flow properties

</div>

### Novartis's Argument:

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

"Beta crystalline form is a patentable improvement over base form because of its superior properties."

</div>

### Supreme Court's Decision - PATENT REJECTED:

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

#### 5 Key Holdings:

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**1. New Form of Known Substance:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Beta crystalline form is a new form of known substance (Imatinib Mesylate).
</div>

<br>

**2. Bioavailability ≠ Enhanced Efficacy:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Better bioavailability does NOT constitute enhanced therapeutic efficacy.
</div>

<br>

**3. Blood Absorption vs. Disease Treatment:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
More drug in blood doesn't mean it treats cancer better.
</div>

<br>

**4. Therapeutic Effect Not Enhanced:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
The ability to treat cancer was not enhanced.
</div>

<br>

**5. Section 3(d) Applicable:**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Patent application rejected under Section 3(d).
</div>

</div>

</div>

### 8 Significance Points:

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**1. Strict Interpretation:** Established India's strict interpretation of Section 3(d)

**2. Bioavailability Insufficient:** Confirmed bioavailability improvements alone insufficient

**3. Prevented Evergreening:** Stopped patent term extension through minor modifications

**4. Affordability Maintained:** Generic manufacturers could continue production - kept medicine affordable

**5. Policy Victory:** Upheld India's public health policy priorities

**6. Global Impact:** Became model for other developing countries

**7. TRIPS Compliance:** Showed TRIPS-compliant law can protect public health

**8. Access to Medicines:** Ensured continued access to affordable cancer treatment

</div>

### Importance for Public Health:

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

Section 3(d) ensures that patents are granted only for genuine innovations that provide real therapeutic benefits, not for minor tweaks. This keeps essential medicines affordable and accessible.

</div>

</div>

## ⚖️ Balancing Innovation and Access

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

The patentability criteria and Section 3 exclusions reflect India's attempt to balance:

### 4 Policy Objectives:

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

**1. Encouraging Innovation:** Through patent protection and exclusivity

**2. Ensuring Access:** To essential goods, especially medicines

**3. Protecting Traditional Knowledge:** Preventing biopiracy and misappropriation

**4. Promoting Genuine Innovation:** Rather than minor tweaks and evergreening

</div>

Section 3(d), in particular, represents India's commitment to ensuring that patent protection serves genuine innovation and public health needs.

</div>

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

The three criteria for patentability - **novelty, inventive step, and industrial applicability** - ensure that only genuine innovations receive patent protection. The exclusions under Section 3, particularly Section 3(d), further refine this by preventing the patenting of minor variations, traditional knowledge, and subject matter that should remain in the public domain.

**Section 3(d) Significance:**

Section 3(d) is especially significant in the pharmaceutical context. The Novartis case demonstrated that India's patent system can effectively balance the need to reward genuine pharmaceutical innovation with the imperative of keeping essential medicines affordable and accessible. This provision has become a model for other developing countries seeking to prevent evergreening while complying with international obligations under TRIPS.

**Practical Importance:**

Understanding these provisions is crucial for:
- **Inventors:** To assess whether their invention is patentable
- **Patent attorneys:** To draft applications that meet patentability criteria
- **Businesses:** To develop patenting strategies
- **Public health advocates:** To ensure access to medicines

The Indian Patents Act, through its patentability criteria and exclusions, aims to create an innovation ecosystem that serves both inventors and society, promoting genuine technological progress while safeguarding public welfare.
