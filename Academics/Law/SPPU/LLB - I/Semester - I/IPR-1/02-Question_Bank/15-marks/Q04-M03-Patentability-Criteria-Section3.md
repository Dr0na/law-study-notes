# 📝 Question: Discuss the criteria for patentability and explain the provisions of Section 3 of the Patents Act, 1970, regarding non-patentable inventions with special reference to Section 3(d). (15 Marks)

---

## ✍️ Answer:

### 🎯 Introduction

Patents are exclusive rights granted to inventors for their inventions, providing them with the ability to prevent others from making, using, or selling the patented invention for a limited period (20 years). However, not every invention qualifies for patent protection. The Patents Act, 1970, establishes specific criteria that an invention must meet to be patentable and explicitly excludes certain categories of inventions from patentability.

### 📋 3 Criteria for Patentability

**🎯 Mnemonic: "NIA"**
- **N** - Novelty
- **I** - Inventive Step
- **A** - (Industrial) Applicability

---

#### 🆕 Criterion 1: Novelty (Newness)

##### 📜 Legal Requirement

An invention is considered novel if it is **not part of the state of the art** - meaning it hasn't been disclosed to the public anywhere in the world before the filing date of the patent application.

##### 🌐 State of the Art Includes

- 📄 Published patents from any country
- 📚 Scientific and technical journals and publications
- 📖 Books, magazines, conference papers
- 🎤 Public demonstrations or exhibitions
- 🏭 Prior use anywhere in the world
- 💻 Information available on the internet
- 📢 Any other form of public disclosure

##### 🌍 Global Novelty Standard

India follows the **absolute novelty** standard. Novelty is assessed on a **worldwide basis**. Even if an invention has been published in an obscure journal in a remote country, it can destroy novelty.

**✅ Example:** If you invent a new type of solar panel, but someone in Germany published a similar design five years ago in a technical journal, your invention lacks novelty, even if you were unaware of that publication.

##### ❌ 6 Acts That Destroy Novelty

**1. Publications by Anyone:**
Including publications by the inventor themselves.

**2. Public Demonstrations:**
At exhibitions (unless within grace period).

**3. Sales or Offers:**
Commercial sales or offers for sale.

**4. Oral Presentations:**
Public speeches or lectures.

**5. Internet Publications:**
Any online disclosure.

**6. Prior Use:**
Use anywhere in the world before filing.

##### ⏱️ Grace Period (12 Months)

Indian law provides a limited grace period for disclosures made:
- 🏛️ Before learned societies (scientific/technical societies)
- 🏆 At government-approved exhibitions

**⚠️ However, best practice is to file BEFORE any public disclosure.**

##### ✅ What Doesn't Destroy Novelty

- 🤐 Confidential disclosures (under NDAs)
- 🏢 Internal company discussions
- 🔬 Private experiments

---

#### 💡 Criterion 2: Inventive Step (Non-Obviousness)

##### 📜 Legal Definition (Section 2(1)(ja))

"Inventive step" means a feature of an invention that involves **technical advance** as compared to the existing knowledge or having **economic significance** or both, and that makes the invention **not obvious to a person skilled in the art**.

##### ❓ The Core Question

Would a person skilled in the art find the invention to be an obvious next step based on existing knowledge?

##### 👨‍🔬 4 Characteristics of "Person Skilled in the Art"

**1. Ordinary Skill Level:**
Has ordinary skill in the relevant technical field (not a genius, but not a novice).

**2. Access to All Information:**
Has access to all published information (the state of the art).

**3. Technically Competent:**
Is technically competent but not particularly creative.

**4. No Inventive Research:**
Would not undertake inventive research.

##### ❌ 3 Examples of "Obvious" (No Inventive Step)

**1. Material Substitution:**
Replacing a wooden handle with a plastic handle where both materials are well-known.

**2. Size Variation:**
Making something bigger or smaller without achieving an unexpected advantage.

**3. Simple Combination:**
Combining two known devices in an obvious manner without a new technical effect.

##### ✅ 4 Examples of "Non-Obvious" (Inventive Step Present)

**1. Surprising Result:**
Combining known elements in a new way that produces a surprising or unexpected result.

**2. Long-Standing Problem Solved:**
Solving a problem that experts have tried and failed to solve.

**3. Unpredicted Result:**
Achieving a result that experts would not have predicted.

**4. Unexpected Property:**
Discovering an unexpected property or use of a known substance.

**✅ Concrete Example:**

If metal knobs on cupboards commonly corrode due to moisture, replacing them with plastic knobs is obvious. However, if you discover that a specific formulation of plastic not only prevents corrosion but also has **antibacterial properties** that weren't previously known, this might involve an inventive step.

**⚠️ Important:** Courts must guard against "hindsight bias" - what seems obvious after the invention is known may not have been obvious beforehand.

---

#### 🏭 Criterion 3: Industrial Applicability (Utility)

##### 📜 Legal Definition (Section 2(1)(ac))

"Capable of industrial application" means that the invention is **capable of being made or used in an industry**.

##### 🏗️ "Industry" Broadly Interpreted

- 🏭 Manufacturing
- 🌾 Agriculture
- 🐟 Fisheries
- ⚙️ Any other productive activity

##### 🔑 3 Key Requirements

**1. Must be Operative:**
- The invention must actually work as claimed
- Purely theoretical inventions not patentable
- Perpetual motion machines rejected (violate natural laws)

**2. Must be Useful:**
- Must provide some benefit or solve some problem
- Utility doesn't have to be groundbreaking
- Even minor improvements acceptable

**3. Must be Reproducible:**
- Capable of being made or repeated by others
- Patent specification must enable reproduction
- Fulfills social contract - disclosure for exclusivity

##### ✅ / ❌ Examples

**✅ Industrially Applicable:**
- 💊 New pharmaceutical compound treating disease
- ⚙️ Improved manufacturing process reducing waste
- 🌾 New agricultural tool

**❌ Not Industrially Applicable:**
- ➗ Pure mathematical formula
- 🌌 Discovery of natural law
- 🎨 Purely artistic method

### 🚫 Non-Patentable Inventions (Section 3)

---

### 💊 Section 3(d) - The Anti-Evergreening Provision ⭐⭐⭐

**⚡ This is THE MOST IMPORTANT provision in Indian patent law for pharmaceuticals.**

##### 📜 What Section 3(d) Says

"The mere discovery of a new form of a known substance which does not result in the enhancement of the known efficacy of that substance..."

**Explanation:** Salts, esters, ethers, polymorphs, metabolites, pure form, particle size, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes, combinations and other derivatives of known substance shall be considered to be the same substance, **unless they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy**.

---

##### 🎯 Purpose

To prevent **"evergreening"** - obtaining multiple patents on minor variations of the same drug to extend market exclusivity beyond 20 years.

---

##### 📊 3 Key Elements of Section 3(d)

**🎯 Mnemonic: "ESE"**
- **E** - Enhanced Efficacy Required
- **S** - Same Substance Presumption
- **E** - Explanation Lists Derivatives

---

##### 🔬 Element 1: 12 Forms Presumed "Same Substance"

Unless they differ significantly in efficacy:

1. 🧪 Salts
2. 🧬 Esters
3. 🔬 Ethers
4. 💎 Polymorphs (crystal forms)
5. 🧫 Metabolites
6. ✨ Pure form
7. 📏 Particle size variations
8. 🔄 Isomers
9. 🧪 Mixtures of isomers
10. 🔗 Complexes
11. ➕ Combinations
12. 🔀 Other derivatives

##### 💊 Element 2: "Efficacy" = Therapeutic Efficacy

For pharmaceutical products, "efficacy" specifically means **therapeutic efficacy** - the ability to produce the desired therapeutic effect (ability to treat the disease).

##### 🎯 Element 3: Enhanced Efficacy Must Be Demonstrated

Burden is on applicant to show **enhanced therapeutic efficacy**.

---

##### ❌ 5 Properties That Are NOT Sufficient

**1. 📈 Improved Bioavailability:**
More drug absorbed into blood (but doesn't treat disease better).

**2. 💪 Better Stability:**
Drug remains stable longer.

**3. 💧 Improved Solubility:**
Dissolves better in water.

**4. ⏱️ Longer Shelf Life:**
Lasts longer before expiry.

**5. ⚙️ Easier Manufacturing:**
Simpler to produce.

**⚠️ Unless these translate into enhanced therapeutic efficacy.**

---

##### ✅ 4 Properties That ARE Sufficient

**1. 🎯 Significantly Better Treatment:**
Drug treats the disease more effectively.

**2. ⚕️ Substantially Reduced Side Effects:**
Much safer with fewer adverse effects.

**3. ⏱️ Faster/Longer-Acting:**
Significantly faster onset or longer duration of treatment effect.

**4. 💪 Substantially Improved Outcomes:**
Better patient recovery and health outcomes.

### ⚖️ Landmark Case: Novartis v. Union of India (2013) ⭐⭐⭐

#### 📋 Case Facts

**💊 Drug:** Imatinib Mesylate - Cancer drug (Brand: Gleevec)  
**🏢 Applicant:** Novartis AG (Swiss pharmaceutical company)  
**📅 Year:** 2013 (Supreme Court)

##### 🔬 What Novartis Claimed

Patent for **beta crystalline form** of Imatinib Mesylate (Novartis already had patent on base form).

**Beta crystalline form had:**

1. 📈 **30% better bioavailability** (more drug absorbed)
2. 💪 Better thermal stability
3. ⚡ Better flow properties

##### 💬 Novartis's Argument

"Beta crystalline form is a patentable improvement with superior properties."

---

#### ⚖️ Supreme Court's Decision

##### 🚫 Patent Application REJECTED

**5 Key Holdings:**

**1. New Form of Known Substance:**
Beta crystalline form is a new form of known substance (Imatinib Mesylate).

**2. Bioavailability ≠ Enhanced Efficacy:**
Better bioavailability does NOT constitute enhanced therapeutic efficacy.

**3. Blood Absorption vs. Disease Treatment:**
More drug in blood doesn't mean it treats cancer better.

**4. Therapeutic Effect Not Enhanced:**
The ability to treat cancer was not enhanced.

**5. Section 3(d) Applicable:**
Patent application rejected under Section 3(d).

---

#### 🌟 8 Significance Points

**1. 📏 Strict Interpretation:**
Established India's strict interpretation of Section 3(d).

**2. 📊 Bioavailability Insufficient:**
Confirmed bioavailability improvements alone are insufficient.

**3. 🛡️ Prevented Evergreening:**

### ⚖️ Balancing Innovation and Access

The patentability criteria and Section 3 exclusions reflect India's balance between:

#### 4 Policy Objectives

**1. 🔬 Encouraging Innovation:**
Through patent protection and exclusivity.

**2. 💊 Ensuring Access:**
To essential goods, especially medicines.

**3. 🌿 Protecting Traditional Knowledge:**
Preventing biopiracy and misappropriation.

**4. ✨ Promoting Genuine Innovation:**
Rather than minor tweaks and evergreening.

---

### 🎯 Conclusion

The three criteria for patentability - **novelty, inventive step, and industrial applicability** - ensure that only genuine innovations receive patent protection. The exclusions under Section 3, particularly Section 3(d), further refine this by preventing the patenting of:
- Minor variations (evergreening)
- Traditional knowledge
- Subject matter that should remain in public domain

**💊 Section 3(d) is especially significant:**

The Novartis case demonstrated that India's patent system can effectively balance the need to reward genuine pharmaceutical innovation with the imperative of keeping essential medicines affordable and accessible. This provision has become a model for other developing countries.

**💡 Practical Importance:**

Understanding these provisions is crucial for:
- **🔬 Inventors:** Assess patentability
