# 📖 Module 06: Geographical Indications

## 🗺️ 1. Understanding GI

### What is a Geographical Indication?

A **Geographical Indication (GI)** is a sign used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities, reputation, or characteristics that are essentially attributable to that place of origin.

**Key Concept:**

GIs connect products to places. The geographical origin confers unique qualities on the product - whether due to natural factors (climate, soil, water) or human factors (traditional production methods, skills).

**Examples:**

**Indian GIs:**
- **Darjeeling Tea** - Tea grown in the Darjeeling region has unique flavor due to climate and altitude
- **Basmati Rice** - Rice grown in specific regions of India with unique aroma and characteristics
- **Kanchipuram Silk** - Silk sarees from Kanchipuram with distinctive weaving techniques
- **Alphonso Mango** - Mangoes from specific regions of Maharashtra with unique taste and texture
- **Mysore Silk** - Silk from Mysore with traditional production methods

**International GIs:**
- **Champagne** - Sparkling wine from the Champagne region of France
- **Roquefort Cheese** - Cheese from Roquefort, France, aged in specific caves
- **Scotch Whisky** - Whisky from Scotland
- **Tequila** - Spirit from specific regions of Mexico
- **Parmigiano-Reggiano** - Cheese from specific provinces in Italy

### Legal Definition (Section 2(1)(e), GI Act, 1999)

"Geographical indication", in relation to goods, means an indication which identifies such goods as **agricultural goods, natural goods or manufactured goods** as originating, or manufactured in the **territory of a country**, or a **region or locality** in that territory, where a given **quality, reputation or other characteristic** of such goods is **essentially attributable** to its geographical origin and in case where such goods are manufactured goods one of the activities of either the production or of processing or preparation of the goods concerned takes place in such territory, region or locality, as the case may be.

**Key Elements:**

**1. Indication:**
A sign, name, or indication identifying the geographical origin.

**2. Types of Goods:**
- Agricultural goods (e.g., Darjeeling Tea, Alphonso Mango)
- Natural goods (e.g., minerals, natural resources)
- Manufactured goods (e.g., Kanchipuram Silk, Banarasi Sarees)

**3. Geographical Origin:**
Must originate from a specific:
- Country
- Region within a country
- Locality within a region

**4. Link to Origin:**
The goods must have:
- **Quality**, OR
- **Reputation**, OR
- **Other characteristic**

That is **essentially attributable** to the geographical origin.

**"Essentially Attributable" means:**
The link between the product and place must be significant - the geographical factors (natural or human) give the product its distinctive qualities.

**5. For Manufactured Goods:**
At least one of the activities must take place in that geographical area:
- Production
- Processing
- Preparation

### Meaning, Definition, and Eligibility Criteria

#### **Eligibility for GI Protection**

**1. Geographical Origin:**

The goods must originate from a defined geographical area.

**Example:** "Darjeeling" must come from the Darjeeling district.

**2. Distinctive Quality, Reputation, or Characteristic:**

The goods must have a special quality, reputation, or characteristic.

**What Qualifies:**
- **Quality:** Measurable attributes (taste, aroma, texture, appearance)
- **Reputation:** Known and recognized for certain qualities
- **Other Characteristics:** Traditional production methods, cultural significance

**3. Essential Link:**

The distinctive quality/reputation must be **essentially attributable** to the geographical origin.

**Natural Factors:**
- Climate (temperature, rainfall, humidity)
- Soil composition
- Altitude
- Water source

**Human Factors:**
- Traditional production methods
- Specific skills and knowledge
- Cultural practices passed down generations

**Example:**
- **Darjeeling Tea:** The unique flavor comes from the specific climate, altitude, and soil of Darjeeling, combined with traditional cultivation and processing methods.
- **Kanchipuram Silk:** The distinctive silk sarees result from the traditional weaving techniques and designs specific to Kanchipuram.

**4. Consistency:**

The goods must consistently exhibit the distinctive qualities when they originate from the designated geographical area.

### Types of Geographical Indications

**1. Based on Link to Geography:**

**a) Appellations of Origin (Stronger Link):**
- Qualities **exclusively or essentially** due to geographical environment
- Includes both natural and human factors
- Stricter link requirement

**Example:** Champagne - can only be called Champagne if from the Champagne region and follows specific production methods.

**b) Geographical Indications (Broader):**
- Quality, reputation, or characteristic attributable to geographical origin
- Somewhat more flexible

**2. Based on Type of Goods:**

**a) Agricultural GIs:**
Products of agriculture (tea, rice, fruits, vegetables).

**b) Natural GIs:**
Products from nature (minerals, water).

**c) Manufactured GIs:**
Products manufactured using traditional methods (handicrafts, textiles, processed foods).

### Purposes and Benefits of GI Protection

**1. For Producers:**
- Protects reputation and goodwill
- Prevents misuse of the geographical name
- Enables premium pricing
- Protects traditional knowledge and practices

**2. For Consumers:**
- Assurance of quality and authenticity
- Information about origin
- Trust in the product

**3. For Communities:**
- Promotes rural development
- Preserves traditional knowledge
- Protects cultural heritage
- Encourages sustainable practices

**4. For the Region:**
- Economic development
- Tourism promotion
- International recognition

## 🌐 2. TRIPS Agreement on GI (Articles 22-24)

TRIPS provides international standards for the protection of geographical indications.

### Article 22: Protection of Geographical Indications

#### **22.1 - Definition**

"Geographical indications" are indications which identify a good as originating in the territory of a Member, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographical origin.

**Note:** This definition forms the basis for most national GI laws, including India's.

#### **22.2 - Protection Required**

Members shall provide the legal means for interested parties to **prevent**:

**a) Misleading Use:**
Use of any means in the designation or presentation of a good that indicates or suggests that the good in question originates in a geographical area other than the true place of origin, in a manner which **misleads the public** as to the geographical origin of the good.

**Example:** Selling tea labeled "Darjeeling Tea" when it doesn't come from Darjeeling.

**b) Unfair Competition:**
Any use which constitutes an act of **unfair competition** within the meaning of Article 10bis of the Paris Convention.

**What This Means:**
Protection against false or deceptive indications regarding the geographical origin that could mislead consumers or harm competitors.

#### **22.3 - Refusal or Invalidation of Trademarks**

A Member shall **refuse** or **invalidate** the registration of a trademark which:
- Contains or consists of a geographical indication for goods not originating in the territory indicated, AND
- Use of the indication would **mislead the public** as to the true place of origin

**Exception:** If the trademark was applied for or registered in good faith before the GI was protected in its country of origin, or before the GI became well-known in that country, then the trademark may be maintained.

**Conflict with Trademarks:**

If a geographical name is already a registered trademark, and someone later seeks GI protection for that name, there may be a conflict. TRIPS requires consideration of prior trademark rights in good faith.

#### **22.4 - Protection of Homonymous Geographical Indications**

**"Homonymous GIs"** are GIs that are spelled or pronounced the same but refer to different places.

**Example:** "Rioja" could refer to wine from Rioja, Spain, and also Rioja, Argentina.

Members shall determine the practical conditions for protecting homonymous GIs, taking into account:
- The need to ensure equitable treatment of the producers
- The need to ensure consumers are not misled

**Solution:** Often, additional qualifiers are used (e.g., "Rioja, Spain" vs. "Rioja, Argentina").

### Article 23: Additional Protection for Geographical Indications for Wines and Spirits

**Why Special Protection?**

Wines and spirits are traditionally associated with geographical origin, and false labeling is common. TRIPS provides **additional, stronger protection** for GIs of wines and spirits.

#### **23.1 - Enhanced Protection**

Members shall provide legal means to prevent use of a GI identifying wines or spirits for wines or spirits not originating in the place indicated by the GI, **even where**:
- The true origin is indicated
- The GI is used in translation
- The GI is accompanied by expressions like "kind," "type," "style," "imitation," etc.

**What This Means:**

For wines and spirits, you **cannot** use the GI even if you clarify that it's not from that place.

**Examples (All Prohibited):**

- ❌ "California Champagne" (even though California is indicated)
- ❌ "Champagne-style wine"
- ❌ "Imitation Champagne"
- ❌ "Champagne-type sparkling wine"

**Only wine from Champagne, France, can be called "Champagne."**

**Contrast with Article 22.2:**

Under Article 22.2 (for other goods), you could potentially use a GI if you clarify the true origin (e.g., "Darjeeling-style tea from Assam" might be permissible, though it depends on whether it misleads).

Under Article 23.1 (for wines and spirits), any use of the GI is prohibited, even with clarification.

#### **23.2 - Refusal or Invalidation of Trademarks for Wines and Spirits**

Members shall refuse or invalidate registration of a trademark for wines or spirits which contains or consists of a GI for wines or spirits not having that origin.

**Exception:** Same as Article 22.3 - if the trademark was applied for in good faith before specified dates.

#### **23.3 - Homonymous GIs for Wines**

For homonymous GIs for wines:
- Protection shall be accorded to each indication
- Members shall determine practical conditions for differentiation, ensuring equitable treatment and that consumers are not misled

#### **23.4 - Negotiations**

Members agreed to enter into negotiations to establish a multilateral system of notification and registration of GIs for wines (and potentially spirits).

**Status:** Negotiations have been ongoing but a comprehensive multilateral system has not yet been established.

### Article 24: International Negotiations and Exceptions

#### **24.1 - Continued Negotiations**

Members agree to negotiate on:
- Increasing protection for individual GIs (under Article 23)
- Establishing the multilateral system of notification and registration

#### **24.4 - Prior Use Exceptions**

Nothing shall require a member to prevent continued and similar use of a GI for wines or spirits by nationals or domiciliaries who have used that GI:
- In good faith
- For at least 10 years prior to the WTO Agreement entering into force, OR
- In good faith before that date

**Prior Trademark Exceptions:**

Nothing shall require a member to bring a trademark into conflict with a GI if:
- The trademark was applied for or registered in good faith, OR
- Rights were acquired through use in good faith before the GI was protected

#### **24.9 - Generic Names**

Nothing shall require protection of a GI if the term is **generic** (i.e., the common name for the product in that country).

**Example:**
"Cheddar" (originally from Cheddar, England) is now considered generic for a type of cheese and is not protected as a GI in most countries.

**Who Determines Generic Status?**
The country where the term is used determines whether it's generic based on usage and understanding in that country.

## 🌍 3. Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration (1958)

### Overview

The **Lisbon Agreement** is a special treaty specifically for the protection of appellations of origin.

**Adopted:** 1958

**Administered by:** WIPO

**Current Version:** Geneva Act (2015) expanded to cover geographical indications as well.

### What are Appellations of Origin?

**"Appellation of Origin"** is a more restrictive form of geographical indication.

**Definition (Article 2, Lisbon Agreement):**

The geographical denomination of a country, region, or locality that serves to designate a product originating therein, the quality or characteristics of which are due **exclusively or essentially** to the geographical environment, including natural and human factors.

**Difference from GI:**

| **Aspect** | **Appellation of Origin** | **Geographical Indication** |
|------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Link Requirement** | Exclusively or essentially due to geographical environment | Essentially attributable to geographical origin |
| **Strictness** | Stricter | More flexible |
| **Reputation** | Reputation alone not enough - must have quality/characteristics | Reputation can be sufficient |
| **Example** | Champagne, Roquefort | Darjeeling, Basmati |

### How the Lisbon System Works

**Step 1: Protection in Country of Origin**

The appellation must first be protected in its country of origin.

**Step 2: International Registration**

The country of origin applies for international registration with WIPO.

**Step 3: WIPO Registration**

WIPO registers the appellation and notifies all other member countries.

**Step 4: Automatic Protection**

The appellation is automatically protected in all member countries.

**Key Feature - Automatic Protection:**

Unlike the Madrid or Hague systems (where each country can refuse), Lisbon provides **automatic protection** in all member countries without examination (subject to very limited grounds for refusal).

**Step 5: Objections (Limited)**

Member countries can declare that they cannot ensure protection, but only on limited grounds (e.g., the term is generic in their country).

### Protection Provided

**Indefinite Protection:**

Unlike patents or copyrights, appellations of origin are protected **indefinitely** - as long as the conditions justifying the protection continue to exist in the country of origin.

**Scope:**

Protection against:
- Use of the appellation on products not originating from the designated area
- Use that misleads as to origin
- Imitation, even if the true origin is indicated
- Use of terms like "kind," "type," "style," etc.

### Limitations and Membership

**Limited Membership:**

The Lisbon Agreement has limited membership (around 30 countries, mostly European), compared to other WIPO treaties.

**India is NOT a Member.**

**Reasons for Limited Membership:**
- Automatic protection without examination is seen as too restrictive by some countries
- Concerns about generic terms becoming protected
- Some countries prefer the flexibility of the GI concept under TRIPS

### Geneva Act (2015)

The **Geneva Act** of the Lisbon Agreement (2015) expanded the scope:
- Now covers both "appellations of origin" and "geographical indications"
- More flexible provisions
- Aimed at increasing membership

## 🆚 4. Distinction between Geographical Indications and Trademarks

Both GIs and trademarks serve to identify and distinguish products, but they are fundamentally different.

### Key Differences

| **Aspect** | **Geographical Indication** | **Trademark** |
|------------|----------------------------|---------------|
| **Ownership** | Collective - belongs to producers in the region | Individual or company |
| **Nature** | Identifies geographical origin and qualities tied to that origin | Identifies the commercial source of goods/services |
| **Purpose** | Links product to place; protects regional reputation | Distinguishes one company's products from competitors |
| **Who Can Use** | Any producer in the designated area who meets the criteria | Only the trademark owner or licensees |
| **Transferability** | **Cannot** be sold or transferred (tied to the place) | **Can** be sold or transferred (assignable, licensable) |
| **Validity** | **Indefinite** (as long as the link to geography exists) | Limited term, renewable (10 years in India) |
| **Registration** | Registered by authorized associations/government entities | Registered by individual businesses |
| **Examples** | Darjeeling Tea, Champagne, Basmati Rice | Nike, Coca-Cola, Apple |
| **Indication** | Indicates geographical origin and associated qualities | Indicates commercial origin (company/brand) |
| **Protection Basis** | Based on geographical connection and quality | Based on distinctiveness and use in trade |
| **Loss** | Can be lost if link to geography is lost or name becomes generic | Can be lost due to non-use or becoming generic |

### Can Something Be Both a GI and a Trademark?

**Generally, no.**

- GIs identify origin from a place - collective right
- Trademarks identify origin from a company - individual right

**Conflict Scenarios:**

**1. GI Name Registered as Trademark:**

If someone registers a geographical name as a trademark for goods from that region, and later the name is sought to be protected as a GI, there can be a conflict.

**Example:** If "Darjeeling" was registered as a trademark for tea by one company, and later producers seek GI protection, the trademark could be challenged.

**Resolution:** TRIPS and national laws often provide that trademarks consisting of or containing GIs for goods not from that origin should be refused or invalidated.

**2. Trademark Incorporating GI:**

A trademark can include a geographical element, but it must not mislead about origin.

**Example:** "Darjeeling Delight" (trademark) for tea actually from Darjeeling might be acceptable, but "Darjeeling Delight" for tea from Assam would be misleading.

**3. Prior Rights:**

If a trademark was registered in good faith before the GI was protected, the trademark rights may be maintained (TRIPS Article 24).

### Which to Choose?

**For Individual Companies:**
- **Trademark** is appropriate
- Protects your specific brand
- Exclusive rights
- Transferable

**For Regional Producers:**
- **GI** is appropriate
- Protects the reputation of the region
- Benefits all producers in the area
- Preserves traditional production

## 📋 5. Registration of GI, Effect of Registration, Rights and Remedies

### Registration of Geographical Indications (GI Act, 1999)

India enacted the **Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999** to provide legal protection for GIs.

#### **Who Can Apply for GI Registration?**

**Section 11 - Persons Entitled to Apply:**

**1. Association of Persons:**
An association of persons or producers or any organization or authority established by law representing the interests of producers.

**2. Any Producer:**
Any producer of the concerned goods.

**Note:** Individual producers typically don't apply directly; usually, associations or cooperatives apply on behalf of all producers in the region.

**Examples:**
- Tea Board of India (for Darjeeling Tea)
- Spices Board (for various spice GIs)
- Khadi and Village Industries Commission (for Pochampally Ikat)

#### **Procedure for Registration**

**Step 1: Application**

**Form GI-1 (Application for Registration)**

**Details Required:**
- Name and address of the applicant
- Type of goods (agricultural, natural, manufactured)
- Specification of goods
- Name of the geographical indication
- Description of the geographical area
- Proof of origin
- Details of the qualities, reputation, or characteristics linked to the geographical origin
- Class of goods (as per GI classification)
- Map of the geographical area

**Supporting Documents:**
- Statement of case (detailed explanation)
- Affidavits
- Evidence of special qualities/reputation/characteristics
- Historical evidence
- Map demarcating the geographical area

**Where to File:**
Geographical Indications Registry, Chennai

**Step 2: Examination**

The **Examiner of Geographical Indications** examines the application for:
- Compliance with formalities
- Whether the applicant is entitled to apply
- Whether the GI meets the criteria (link to geography, distinctive qualities, etc.)

**Examination Report:**

If objections, the examiner issues a report.

**Step 3: Response to Objections**

Applicant must respond within **2 months** (extendable by 1 month).

**Step 4: Acceptance**

If objections are overcome, the application is **accepted** and **advertised in the Geographical Indications Journal**.

**Step 5: Opposition Period**

**3 months** from the date of advertisement for anyone to file an opposition.

**Grounds for Opposition:**
- GI doesn't meet the definition
- Area not accurately defined
- Link to geography not established
- Prior trademark rights

**If Opposition:**
Opposition proceedings similar to trademarks (notice, counter-statement, evidence, hearing).

**Step 6: Registration**

If no opposition (or opposition is rejected), the GI is **registered**.

**Certificate of Registration** issued.

### Effect of Registration

**Section 22 - Rights Conferred by Registration:**

Registration gives **authorized users** the exclusive right to use the GI in relation to the goods for which it's registered.

**Who Are Authorized Users?**

Producers from the designated geographical area who:
- Are engaged in the production of the goods to which the GI applies
- Meet the standards/conditions specified for the GI
- Are registered as authorized users

**Effect:**

- Only authorized users can use the GI
- Prevents unauthorized use by others
- Provides legal basis for enforcement

**Note:** Registration creates a **collective right**, not an individual exclusive right.

### Rights of Registered GI Holders

**1. Exclusive Use:**
Authorized users have the right to use the GI on their products.

**2. Prevent Unauthorized Use:**
Can prevent others from using the GI or any similar indication on goods not from the designated area or not meeting the specified standards.

**3. Prevent Misleading Use:**
Can prevent use that misleads the public as to the geographical origin.

**4. Prevent Use Indicating False Origin:**
Can prevent any indication that suggests the goods originate from the GI area when they don't.

**5. Prevent Unfair Competition:**
Can prevent acts that constitute unfair competition.

### Remedies for Infringement (Sections 21, 23)

#### **What Constitutes Infringement?**

**Unauthorized Use:**
Use of the GI by persons not authorized (not from the area or not meeting the standards).

**False or Misleading Use:**
Use in a manner that misleads the public regarding the geographical origin.

**Similar Indications:**
Use of indications that falsely suggest the goods originate from the GI area.

#### **Civil Remedies**

**1. Injunction (Section 21(1)):**
Court order to restrain infringement.

**2. Damages (Section 21(2)):**
Monetary compensation for the harm suffered.

**3. Accounts of Profits:**
Infringer must pay over profits made from infringement.

**4. Delivery Up:**
Infringing goods and materials delivered to the plaintiff or destroyed.

#### **Criminal Remedies (Section 23)**

**Penalties for False Indications:**

If a person:
- Applies a false geographical indication to goods
- Sells or offers for sale goods with a false GI
- Falsely suggests goods are registered under the Act

**Punishment:**
- **Imprisonment:** Minimum 6 months, up to 3 years
- **Fine:** Minimum ₹50,000, up to ₹2 lakhs

**For Second and Subsequent Offenses:**
- **Imprisonment:** Minimum 1 year, up to 3 years
- **Fine:** Minimum ₹1 lakh, up to ₹2 lakhs

**Police Powers:**
Police can investigate and seize infringing goods.

### Duration of GI Registration

**Initial Period (Section 18):**
10 years from the date of registration.

**Renewal (Section 18(2)):**
Renewable for further periods of 10 years indefinitely.

**Why Indefinite Renewability?**

GIs represent the collective heritage and traditions of a region. As long as the link to geography exists and the qualities persist, the GI remains valid.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways from Module 06

1. **Geographical Indications (GIs)** are signs that identify goods as originating from a specific place, where quality, reputation, or characteristics are essentially attributable to that geographical origin.

2. **Three Key Elements:** Geographical origin, distinctive quality/reputation/characteristic, essential link between the two.

3. **Types:** Agricultural goods (Darjeeling Tea, Basmati Rice), natural goods, manufactured goods (Kanchipuram Silk, Mysore Silk).

4. **TRIPS (Articles 22-24):**
   - **Article 22:** General protection - prevent misleading use, unfair competition
   - **Article 23:** Enhanced protection for wines and spirits - cannot use GI even with clarifications like "style" or "type"
   - **Article 24:** Exceptions for prior use and prior trademark rights in good faith

5. **Lisbon Agreement (1958):** Protects appellations of origin (stricter than GIs) with automatic international protection; India not a member.

6. **GI vs. Trademark:**
   - GI: Collective right, identifies place, not transferable, indefinite
   - Trademark: Individual right, identifies company, transferable, limited term

7. **Indian GI Act, 1999:**
   - Registration by associations/producers
   - Procedure: Application → Examination → Advertisement → Opposition (optional) → Registration
   - Term: 10 years, renewable indefinitely

8. **Rights:** Authorized users can exclusively use the GI; can prevent unauthorized/misleading use.
