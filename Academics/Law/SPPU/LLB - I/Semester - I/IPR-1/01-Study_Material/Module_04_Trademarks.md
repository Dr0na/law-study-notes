# 📖 Module 04: Trademarks

## ™️ 1. Understanding Trademark

### What is a Trademark?

A trademark is a distinctive sign, symbol, word, phrase, logo, design, or combination thereof that identifies and distinguishes the goods or services of one enterprise from those of others. Think of it as the "identity" or "brand name" of a product or service.

**Purpose of Trademarks:**

- **Source Identification:** Indicates the origin of goods/services
- **Quality Assurance:** Consumers associate trademarks with consistent quality
- **Brand Protection:** Prevents confusion and protects goodwill
- **Marketing Tool:** Builds brand recognition and loyalty

**Examples of Famous Trademarks:**
- TATA (conglomerate)
- Nike Swoosh (logo)
- Coca-Cola (brand name and distinctive bottle shape)
- McDonald's Golden Arches (logo)
- "Just Do It" (slogan - can be trademarked)

### Legal Definition (Section 2(1)(zb), Trade Marks Act, 1999)

"Trade mark" means a mark capable of being represented graphically and which is capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one person from those of others and may include shape of goods, their packaging and combination of colours.

**Key Elements:**

**1. Mark:**
Can be:
- Words (brand names)
- Letters or numerals
- Devices (logos, symbols)
- Shape of goods or packaging (3D marks)
- Combination of colors
- Sound (sound marks - e.g., Nokia tune)
- Smell (in some countries, though not explicitly in India)
- Combination of any of the above

**2. Graphically Representable:**
Must be capable of being represented graphically (visually) so that it can be precisely identified.

**3. Capable of Distinguishing:**
Must be able to distinguish the goods/services of one person from others. This is the core function of a trademark - to distinguish!

### Meaning and Eligibility Criteria

For a trademark to be registrable, it must satisfy certain criteria:

#### **1. Distinctiveness**

A trademark must be distinctive - capable of distinguishing goods/services.

**Types of Marks Based on Distinctiveness:**

**a) Fanciful/Coined Marks (Strongest):**
- Invented words with no prior meaning
- Examples: KODAK, XEROX, GOOGLE
- Inherently distinctive, strongest protection

**b) Arbitrary Marks (Very Strong):**
- Real words used in a context unrelated to the goods
- Examples: APPLE (for computers), CAMEL (for cigarettes)
- No connection between word and product
- Strong protection

**c) Suggestive Marks (Strong):**
- Suggest qualities or characteristics of the product, but don't describe it directly
- Require imagination to connect mark with product
- Examples: JAGUAR (for cars - suggests speed and power), GREYHOUND (for bus service - suggests speed)
- Registrable and protected

**d) Descriptive Marks (Weak/Not Registrable):**
- Directly describe characteristics, quality, or features of the product
- Examples: "COLD & CREAMY" for ice cream, "SUPER" for products
- Generally **not registrable** unless they acquire secondary meaning (distinctiveness through use)

**e) Generic Marks (Not Protectable):**
- Common name for the product itself
- Examples: "MILK" for milk, "COMPUTER" for computers
- Cannot be trademarked - would give monopoly over the generic term

**Secondary Meaning:**

A descriptive mark can become registrable if it acquires "secondary meaning" - that is, through extensive use and advertising, consumers come to associate the descriptive term exclusively with one source.

**Example:** "INDIA TODAY" - originally descriptive, but through extensive use, consumers recognize it as the magazine brand.

#### **2. Not Prohibited Under Section 9**

Certain marks are absolutely prohibited from registration (discussed in detail later under "Absolute Grounds of Refusal").

#### **3. Not Conflicting with Earlier Rights**

Must not be identical or deceptively similar to existing registered trademarks for similar goods/services (discussed under "Relative Grounds of Refusal").

### Functions of Trademarks

**1. Identification of Source:**
Helps consumers identify who makes the product.

**2. Guarantee of Quality:**
Consumers expect consistent quality from a trademarked product.

**3. Advertising Tool:**
Builds brand loyalty and recognition.

**4. Asset Value:**
A strong trademark has significant economic value (goodwill).

### Trademark vs. Trade Name

**Trade Name:**
The name of the business itself (the company name).

**Trademark:**
The brand used on goods/services.

**Example:**
- Trade Name: Apple Inc. (the company)
- Trademarks: Apple logo, iPhone, MacBook (brands for products)

A trade name can also function as a trademark if used on goods/services.

## 🌐 2. TRIPS Agreement on Trademark (Articles 15-21)

TRIPS sets international minimum standards for trademark protection.

### Article 15: Protectable Subject Matter

**15.1 - What Can Be a Trademark:**

Any sign, or any combination of signs, capable of distinguishing goods or services shall be registrable as a trademark.

**Types of Signs:**
- Words (including personal names)
- Letters
- Numerals
- Figurative elements
- Combinations of colors
- Any combination of such signs

**Visibly Perceptible Requirement:**

Where signs are not inherently capable of distinguishing, members may make registerability depend on **distinctiveness acquired through use** (secondary meaning).

**15.2 - No Unjustified Discrimination:**

Article 15.1 shall not prevent members from denying registration based on other grounds, provided such grounds don't:
- Derogate from TRIPS provisions, OR
- Require that signs be **visibly perceptible** as a condition for registration

**Clarification:** This meant that non-visual trademarks (sound, smell) could potentially be protected, though it's left to national laws.

### Article 16: Rights Conferred

**16.1 - Exclusive Rights:**

The owner of a registered trademark shall have the **exclusive right** to prevent third parties not having the owner's consent from using:
- **Identical or similar signs** for goods or services which are **identical or similar**
- Where such use would result in a **likelihood of confusion**

**At Least in Case of Identical Sign for Identical Goods:**
A likelihood of confusion shall be presumed if an identical sign is used for identical goods or services.

**16.2 - Well-Known Marks:**

Article 6bis of the Paris Convention (protection of well-known marks) applies to:
- Services as well as goods (Paris Convention originally only covered goods)

**16.3 - Extension of Protection for Well-Known Marks:**

Article 6bis applies to goods or services **not similar** to those for which a trademark is registered, provided that:
- Use would indicate a connection between those goods/services and the owner of the registered trademark, AND
- Interests of the owner are likely to be damaged by such use

**Example:** If "Ferrari" is a well-known trademark for cars, it can also be protected against use on unrelated goods like perfumes or clothing, if such use would damage Ferrari's interests.

### Article 17: Exceptions

Members may provide **limited exceptions** to trademark rights, such as:
- Fair use of descriptive terms
- Provided such exceptions take account of the legitimate interests of the owner and third parties

### Article 18: Term of Protection

**Initial Registration and Renewals:**
- Initial registration and each renewal shall be for a term of **no less than seven years**
- Registration shall be **renewable indefinitely**

**Note:** In India, the term is 10 years, renewable indefinitely.

### Article 19: Requirement of Use

**Use Cannot Be a Condition for Application:**
If use is required to maintain registration:
- Registration may be cancelled only after an **uninterrupted period of at least three years** of non-use
- Unless valid reasons based on obstacles to such use are shown by the trademark owner

**Valid Reasons:** Circumstances arising independently of the will of the owner (e.g., import restrictions, government requirements).

**Use by Licensees:**
Use of a trademark by another person with the owner's consent (licensee) shall be recognized as use of the trademark for maintaining registration.

### Article 20: Other Requirements

**Unjustifiable Encumbrances:**

The use of a trademark shall not be **unjustifiably encumbered** by special requirements, such as:
- Use with another trademark
- Use in a special form
- Use in a manner detrimental to its capability to distinguish goods/services

**Note:** This means you cannot be forced to use your trademark in a way that defeats its purpose of distinguishing your products.

### Article 21: Licensing and Assignment

**Licensing:**
Members may determine conditions for licensing, but **compulsory licensing** of trademarks shall not be permitted.

**Assignment:**
- The owner shall have the right to assign the trademark
- Assignment may be with or without the transfer of the business

**Note:** This liberalized assignment rules. Previously, many countries required that a trademark be assigned along with the goodwill of the business.

## 🌍 3. International Trademark Registration

### Madrid System

The Madrid System provides a cost-effective and efficient way to register and manage trademarks in multiple countries through a single application.

#### **Background**

The Madrid System consists of two treaties:
1. **Madrid Agreement (1891)**
2. **Madrid Protocol (1989/1995)**

Both are administered by WIPO.

#### **How the Madrid System Works**

**Step 1: Basic Application/Registration**

Must have a trademark application or registration in your home country (called the "basic mark" in the "Office of Origin").

**Example:** An Indian company must first file a trademark application in India.

**Step 2: International Application**

File one international application through the home country's trademark office:
- Designate the countries where you want protection (member countries)
- Pay a single set of fees

**Step 3: WIPO Examination**

WIPO examines the application for formalities (not substantive examination).

**Step 4: International Registration**

If in order, WIPO registers the trademark in the **International Register** and publishes it in the **WIPO Gazette of International Marks**.

**Step 5: Notification to Designated Countries**

WIPO notifies each designated country's trademark office.

**Step 6: National Examination**

Each designated country examines the application according to its own laws.
- If no objections, the trademark is protected in that country
- If objections, the country notifies WIPO (which notifies the applicant)

**Step 7: Protection or Refusal**

- **If no refusal:** The trademark is protected in that country (with the same effect as a national registration)
- **If refusal:** The trademark is refused in that country (but may still be protected in other designated countries)

#### **Benefits of the Madrid System**

**1. Cost-Effective:**
- File one application instead of multiple applications
- Pay one set of fees (lower than filing separately in each country)

**2. Efficient:**
- Single application process
- Manage all registrations through one system

**3. Simplified Management:**
- Renewals: Renew all registrations with one renewal
- Changes: Record changes (address, ownership) once, effective in all countries

**4. Language:**
- File in one language (English, French, or Spanish)

**5. Expansion:**
- Can easily add more countries later by filing a "subsequent designation"

#### **Limitations**

**Central Attack:**

If, within 5 years of the international registration, the basic application/registration in the home country is:
- Refused, cancelled, or limited

Then, the international registration automatically becomes invalid (to the same extent) in all designated countries.

**However:** The applicant can "transform" the international registration into national applications in the designated countries, maintaining the original filing date.

**India and the Madrid Protocol:**

India acceded to the Madrid Protocol in 2013. Indian applicants can now use the Madrid System to seek international trademark protection.

### Nice Classification

#### **What is the Nice Classification?**

The **Nice Classification** is an international classification system for goods and services for the purposes of trademark registration.

**Established by:**
The Nice Agreement (1957), administered by WIPO.

#### **Purpose**

Organizes all goods and services into **45 classes**:
- **Classes 1-34:** Goods
- **Classes 35-45:** Services

**Why Classification?**

- Standardizes trademark applications internationally
- Makes searching easier
- Determines the scope of trademark protection
- Determines fees (often based on number of classes)

#### **Examples of Classes:**

- **Class 3:** Cosmetics and cleaning preparations
- **Class 9:** Scientific apparatus, computers, software
- **Class 12:** Vehicles
- **Class 25:** Clothing, footwear, headgear
- **Class 35:** Advertising and business management
- **Class 41:** Education, entertainment
- **Class 42:** Scientific and technological services

**In Practice:**

When applying for a trademark, the applicant must:
- Specify the goods/services for which protection is sought
- Classify them according to the Nice Classification
- Pay fees based on the number of classes

**Multiple Classes:**

A single trademark application can cover multiple classes (in India, since 2017).

**Example:** A company producing clothing and footwear would file under:
- Class 25 (Clothing and Footwear)

If they also sell those items online, they might also cover:
- Class 35 (Online retail services)

## 🇮🇳 4. Trademarks Act 1999

The Trade Marks Act, 1999, replaced the earlier Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. It modernized India's trademark law and aligned it with international standards.

### Key Features of the 1999 Act

1. **Service Marks:** Recognizes trademarks for services (not just goods)
2. **Collective Marks:** Protection for marks used by associations
3. **Certification Marks:** Protection for marks certifying quality, origin, etc.
4. **Longer Term:** 10 years (renewable), compared to 7 years earlier
5. **Simplified Licensing:** Easier procedures for licensing
6. **Appellate Board:** Established IPAB for appeals (though now appeals go to High Courts)

### Absolute Grounds of Refusal (Section 9)

Certain trademarks cannot be registered, even if no one objects.

**Section 9(1) - Marks Devoid of Distinctiveness:**

Trademarks which are **devoid of any distinctive character** shall not be registered.

**Examples:**
- Common words used in their ordinary sense
- Simple geometric shapes
- Basic colors

**Proviso:** A mark may still be registered if it has acquired distinctiveness through use before the application date (secondary meaning).

**Section 9(1)(a) - Descriptive Marks:**

Marks which consist exclusively of marks or indications which may serve to **designate**:
- Kind
- Quality
- Quantity
- Intended purpose
- Values
- Geographical origin
- Time of production
- Other characteristics of goods or services

**Examples:**
- "FRESH" for fruits
- "SUPER" for products
- "DELHI" for goods from Delhi

**Proviso:** Can be registered if acquired distinctiveness through use.

**Section 9(1)(b) - Generic/Customary Marks:**

Marks which consist exclusively of marks or indications which have become **customary** in the current language or in the **bona fide and established practices** of the trade.

**Examples:**
- "LITE" for light beer (if customary in the industry)
- Generic terms that have become common in the trade

**Proviso:** Can still be registered if acquired distinctiveness.

**Section 9(1)(c) - Shape Marks:**

Marks which consist exclusively of:
- The **shape of goods** which results from the nature of the goods themselves
- The shape necessary to obtain a **technical result**
- The shape which gives **substantial value** to the goods

**Examples:**
- Shape of a football (results from the nature of the goods)
- Shape of a Phillips screw head (necessary for technical result)
- Shape of a diamond (gives substantial value)

These shapes cannot be monopolized through trademark registration.

**Note:** Distinctive shapes CAN be registered (e.g., Coca-Cola bottle shape).

**Section 9(2) - Deceptive or Contrary to Law:**

A mark shall not be registered if it:

**9(2)(a) - Fraudulent or Deceptive:**
- Is of such nature as to **deceive the public** or cause confusion

**Example:** "ROLEK" for watches (deceptively similar to "ROLEX")

**9(2)(b) - Contains Scandalous Matter:**
- Contains or comprises of any matter likely to **offend religious susceptibilities** of any class or section of citizens of India

**Example:** Mark using religious symbols in an offensive way

**9(2)(c) - Prohibited by Law:**
- Comprises or contains **scandalous or obscene** matter
- Use is prohibited under the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950

**Examples:**
- National flag or emblem (without permission)
- Name "UN" or similar (prohibited under the Emblems Act)

**Section 9(3) - Marks for Chemical Elements/Compounds:**

A mark shall not be registered if it consists exclusively of:
- The **chemical name** or other name of any single chemical element or single chemical compound
- In relation to a chemical substance or preparation

**Rationale:** Chemical names should remain in public domain for scientific use.

### Relative Grounds of Refusal (Section 11)

Even if a mark is not absolutely prohibited, it may be refused if it conflicts with earlier rights.

**Section 11(1) - Identical/Similar Marks:**

A trademark shall not be registered if:
- It is **identical** with an earlier trademark, AND
- Goods/services are **identical** with those for which the earlier trademark is protected

OR

- It is **similar** to an earlier trademark, AND
- Goods/services are **identical or similar**, AND
- There exists a **likelihood of confusion** on the part of the public (including likelihood of association)

**"Earlier Trademark" means:**
- A registered trademark with an earlier filing date or priority date
- Well-known trademarks (even if not registered in India)

**Test for Confusion:**

Courts consider:
- Visual, phonetic, and conceptual similarity
- Nature of goods/services
- Nature of consumers (general public or specialized)
- Likelihood of confusion or association

**Example:** "PARKE" for pharmaceutical goods was refused because of the existing "PARKE-DAVIS" mark for similar goods.

**Section 11(2) - Similar Mark, Dissimilar Goods (Well-Known Marks):**

A trademark shall not be registered if it is **identical or similar** to an earlier trademark which is a **well-known trademark**, even if:
- The goods/services are **not similar**
- Provided that the use of the later mark would indicate a connection and is likely to harm the interests of the proprietor of the well-known mark

**Example:** "FERRARI" is well-known for cars. "FERRARI PERFUMES" (even though perfumes are different from cars) would be refused because it indicates a connection and could harm Ferrari's interests.

**Section 11(3) - Use Likely to be Prevented by Prior Rights:**

A trademark shall not be registered if its use is liable to be prevented by:
- Any rule of law (e.g., law of passing off)
- Law of copyright or design
- Protection of emblems

## 🆕 5. Non-Conventional Trademarks

Traditionally, trademarks were visual marks (words, logos). Modern trademark law recognizes non-conventional marks.

### Types of Non-Conventional Trademarks

**1. Shape Marks (3D Marks):**

The shape of goods or packaging can be trademarked if distinctive.

**Examples:**
- Coca-Cola bottle shape
- Toblerone triangular chocolate bar shape

**Requirement:** The shape must be **non-functional** and distinctive.

**2. Sound Marks:**

Distinctive sounds can be trademarks.

**Examples:**
- Nokia tune
- Yahoo! yodel
- NBC chimes

**Requirement in India:** Must be represented graphically (e.g., musical notation or sonogram).

**3. Color Marks:**

Single colors or combinations of colors can be trademarked in specific contexts.

**Examples:**
- Cadbury's purple for chocolate packaging
- Tiffany blue for jewelry boxes

**Requirement:** Must have acquired distinctiveness (secondary meaning). Colors per se are generally not registrable without acquired distinctiveness.

**4. Smell Marks:**

Distinctive fragrances can be trademarks (though rarely granted).

**Example:** Smell of fresh-cut grass for tennis balls (granted in the US).

**Requirement:** Must be represented graphically (difficult for smells).

**5. Taste Marks:**

Theoretically possible but extremely rare.

**Challenge:** Graphical representation and proving distinctiveness.

**6. Motion Marks:**

Animated logos or moving images.

**Example:** The roaring lion at the beginning of MGM films.

### Protection of Domain Names

#### **Domain Names as Trademarks**

A **domain name** is an internet address (e.g., www.example.com). Domain names can function as trademarks if they identify the source of goods/services.

**Registration:**

- A domain name itself (e.g., "example.com") can be registered as a trademark if it's used as a source identifier
- The mark registered would typically be the distinctive part (e.g., "EXAMPLE")

#### **Domain Name Disputes**

**Common Issues:**
- **Cybersquatting:** Registering domain names containing famous trademarks with intent to sell to the trademark owner or profit from confusion
- **Typosquatting:** Registering misspelled versions of famous domain names

**Example:** Registering "niike.com" (typo of "nike.com") to capture misdirected traffic.

#### **Remedies**

**1. Trademark Infringement/Passing Off:**
Sue in court for trademark infringement or passing off.

**2. Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP):**

ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) has a dispute resolution mechanism for domain names ending in .com, .net, .org, etc.

**Complainant Must Prove:**
- Domain name is identical or confusingly similar to complainant's trademark
- Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the domain name
- Domain name was registered and is being used in **bad faith**

**Remedies:**
- Transfer of domain name to complainant
- Cancellation of domain name

**Administered by:** WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center, among others.

**3. .IN Domain Names:**

For .in domain names (India), disputes are resolved under the **.IN Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (INDRP)**, administered by NIXI (.IN Registry).

## ⚖️ 6. Effect of Registration, Infringement & Passing-Off

### Effect of Registration (Section 28)

**Exclusive Rights:**

Registration gives the proprietor **exclusive right** to the use of the trademark in relation to the goods or services for which it's registered.

**Includes:**
- Right to use the mark
- Right to prevent unauthorized use by others
- Right to take legal action for infringement

**Statutory Protection:**

Registered trademarks have stronger protection than unregistered marks:
- Presumption of validity
- Easier to prove infringement
- Can claim damages from the date of application (if infringer had notice)

### Infringement of Trademark (Section 29)

**What is Infringement?**

Infringement occurs when a person, without permission, uses a mark that is:
- Identical or deceptively similar to a registered trademark
- In relation to goods/services for which the trademark is registered or similar goods/services
- In a manner likely to cause confusion

#### **Section 29(1) - Use of Identical/Similar Mark:**

A registered trademark is infringed by a person who, not being the registered proprietor or a registered user, uses in the course of trade:
- A mark which is **identical** with, or **deceptively similar** to, the trademark
- In relation to **goods or services** in respect of which the trademark is registered

#### **Section 29(2) - Similar Mark, Similar Goods:**

Even if the mark is used on **different goods/services**, infringement occurs if:
- The mark is identical or similar
- The goods/services are similar to those for which the trademark is registered
- Use is likely to cause **confusion** or **association**

#### **Section 29(3) - Advertising:**

Use of the mark in advertising materials (print, internet, television) constitutes infringement if the conditions in (1) or (2) are met.

#### **Section 29(4) - Use on Packaging:**

Use of the trademark on packaging, labels, or business documents constitutes infringement.

#### **Section 29(5) - Importing Goods:**

Importing goods bearing an infringing mark constitutes infringement.

#### **Section 29(6) - Use of Registered Trademark as Trade Name:**

Using a registered trademark as a **trade name** or part of a trade name, or a business name, constitutes infringement if:
- It is likely to indicate a connection in the course of trade between the goods/services and the person using the name

#### **Section 29(7) - Use in Comparative Advertising:**

Use in **comparative advertising** that:
- Takes unfair advantage of the trademark's reputation
- Is contrary to honest practices in industrial or commercial matters
- Is detrimental to the distinctive character or repute of the trademark

#### **Section 29(8) - Well-Known Trademarks:**

Use of a well-known trademark, or a mark similar to it, even for **dissimilar goods/services**, constitutes infringement if:
- Use would indicate a connection between those goods/services and the proprietor
- Interests of the proprietor are likely to be damaged

#### **Section 29(9) - Spoken Use:**

**Oral use** (speaking the mark) in a way that renders it likely to be taken as referring to the registered trademark constitutes infringement.

### Passing Off

**What is Passing Off?**

Passing off is a common law tort (not requiring registration) where one person misrepresents their goods/services as those of another, causing damage.

**Elements of Passing Off:**

**1. Goodwill:**
The plaintiff must have goodwill or reputation in their mark/name.

**2. Misrepresentation:**
The defendant must make a misrepresentation (intentionally or not) that creates confusion about the source of goods/services.

**3. Damage:**
The plaintiff must have suffered or be likely to suffer damage due to the misrepresentation.

**Example:**
- A company "ABC Ltd." has been selling soap under the brand "FRESHSOAP" for 20 years (not registered).
- A new company starts selling soap under "FRESH SOAP" (slightly different but confusingly similar).
- ABC Ltd. can sue for passing off, even without trademark registration.

**Passing Off vs. Infringement:**

| **Aspect** | **Infringement** | **Passing Off** |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Registration** | Requires registered trademark | No registration required |
| **Basis** | Statutory right | Common law right |
| **Proof** | Show use of identical/similar mark on similar goods | Show goodwill, misrepresentation, damage |
| **Scope** | Limited to registered goods/services | Can apply more broadly |
| **Remedies** | Injunction, damages, account of profits | Injunction, damages |

### Exceptions to Infringement (Section 30)

Certain uses of a registered trademark do not constitute infringement:

**1. Bona Fide Use of Own Name (Section 30(1)):**
A person can use their own name or address even if it's similar to a registered trademark, provided it's bona fide (in good faith).

**2. Descriptive Use (Section 30(2)(a)):**
Use of the mark to indicate:
- Kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value, geographical origin, time of production, or other characteristics of goods/services

Provided it's used in accordance with honest practices.

**Example:** Describing a product as "made with LEATHER" even if "LEATHER" is a trademark, as long as it's honestly describing the product.

**3. Comparative Advertising (Section 30(2)(b)):**
Use of the trademark for the purpose of identifying goods/services as those of the proprietor, provided it's in accordance with honest practices and doesn't:
- Take unfair advantage of the trademark's reputation
- Be detrimental to its distinctive character or reputation

**4. Prior Use (Section 34):**
Continued use by a person who was using the mark before:
- The proprietor's use commenced, OR
- The trademark was registered for that proprietor

Provided the earlier use was bona fide.

### Remedies for Infringement (Section 135)

**Civil Remedies:**

**1. Injunction:**
Court order directing the infringer to stop using the mark.

**2. Damages:**
Monetary compensation for losses suffered.

**3. Accounts of Profits:**
Infringer must pay over profits made from infringement (alternative to damages).

**4. Delivery Up/Destruction:**
Infringing goods, packaging, labels delivered to the proprietor or destroyed.

**Criminal Remedies (Sections 103-105, 107):**

**1. Falsifying or Falsely Applying Trademarks (Section 103):**
- Forgery of a trademark
- Falsely applying a registered trademark to goods
- Punishment: Imprisonment up to 3 years and/or fine up to ₹2 lakhs

**2. Selling Goods with False Trademarks (Section 104):**
- Selling, offering for sale, or possessing goods with a falsely applied trademark
- Punishment: Imprisonment up to 3 years and/or fine up to ₹2 lakhs

**3. Enhanced Penalties for Second Offense (Section 107):**
- Imprisonment: 1-3 years
- Fine: ₹1 lakh to ₹2 lakhs

**Police Powers:**
- Police can investigate
- Seize infringing goods

## 🔀 7. Parallel Importation

### What is Parallel Importation?

**Parallel importation** (or "gray market goods") refers to the importation of genuine trademarked goods from one country to another without the authorization of the trademark owner in the importing country.

**Scenario:**

- Company XYZ has trademark rights in India and the USA
- XYZ sells products cheaper in the USA than in India
- An Indian trader buys genuine XYZ products in the USA and imports them to India, selling at a price lower than XYZ India's price

**Question:** Does this infringe XYZ's Indian trademark?

### Legal Position

**Doctrine of Exhaustion (First Sale Doctrine):**

Once a trademark owner sells a product, they exhaust their rights over that particular product. The buyer can resell it.

**International Exhaustion:**

Whether trademark rights are exhausted internationally (allowing parallel imports) or only nationally (preventing parallel imports) depends on national law.

**Indian Position:**

India generally follows **international exhaustion**, meaning parallel imports of genuine goods are **permitted** and do not infringe trademark rights, provided:
- The goods are genuine (not counterfeit)
- The goods have not been materially altered

**Rationale:**
- Promotes competition
- Prevents price discrimination
- Benefits consumers with lower prices

**Exceptions:**

If the goods are:
- Materially different from those sold by the Indian trademark owner (different quality, specifications)
- Repackaged or relabeled in a way that causes confusion
- Imported in violation of contractual restrictions

Then, parallel importation may be challenged.

### Landmark Case: Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. v. Kapil Wadhwa (2013)

**Facts:**
- Samsung sued importers of Samsung mobile phones from the UAE to India
- Samsung argued these parallel imports infringed their Indian trademark

**Held:**
- Delhi High Court allowed parallel imports of genuine Samsung products
- International exhaustion applies
- Parallel imports of genuine goods do not infringe trademark rights
- Trademark owner cannot prevent such imports to maintain price differentials

**Significance:**
Affirmed that India follows international exhaustion for trademarks.

## 📄 8. Licenses, Assignment and Transmission

### Assignment of Trademarks (Sections 37-44)

**What is Assignment?**

Transfer of ownership of a trademark from one person (assignor) to another (assignee).

**Features:**

**1. With or Without Goodwill (Section 37):**
- A trademark can be assigned with or without the goodwill of the business
- This is a departure from earlier law, which required goodwill to be transferred

**2. Can Be Partial (Section 39):**
- Can assign for some goods/services only (not all)
- Can assign for specific territories

**3. Must Be in Writing (Section 45):**
- Assignment must be in writing
- Signed by the assignor or their authorized agent

**4. Registration of Assignment:**
- Assignment should be registered with the Trademarks Registry
- Until registered, the assignee cannot sue for infringement

**Procedure:**
- Apply to the Registrar (Form TM-24)
- Submit assignment deed
- Pay fees

### Transmission of Trademarks (Section 46)

**Transmission** means transfer by operation of law (not by agreement):

- **Death:** Trademark passes to legal heirs/executors
- **Insolvency:** Trademark passes to the official receiver/liquidator
- **Corporate Succession:** Merger, acquisition

### Licensing of Trademarks (Section 48-55)

**What is a Trademark License?**

Permission granted by the trademark owner (licensor) to another person (licensee) to use the trademark, while ownership remains with the licensor.

**Types of Licenses:**

**1. Registered User (Licensee):**

Under earlier law, licenses had to be registered as "registered users." This is now simplified under the 1999 Act.

**2. Permitted Use (Section 2(1)(r)):**

The 1999 Act introduced the concept of **"permitted use"** - use of a trademark by a person with the consent (express or implied) of the proprietor.

**Effect:**
- Use by the licensee is treated as use by the proprietor (for maintaining the trademark)
- Protects against claims of non-use

**3. Exclusive vs. Non-Exclusive:**

- **Exclusive License:** Only the licensee can use the mark (even the licensor may be excluded, depending on terms)
- **Non-Exclusive License:** Licensor can grant licenses to multiple licensees

**Licensing Terms:**

- Scope of use
- Territory
- Duration
- Quality control (licensor often retains right to ensure quality)
- Royalties

**Registration of License:**

While not mandatory, registration provides:
- Public record
- Protection of licensee's rights
- Can be relevant in infringement proceedings

## 🔑 Key Takeaways from Module 04

1. **Trademarks** are distinctive signs that identify and distinguish goods/services of one enterprise from others.

2. **Distinctiveness** is key - marks range from fanciful/coined (strongest) to descriptive (weak/unregistrable without secondary meaning) to generic (not protectable).

3. **TRIPS (Articles 15-21):**
   - Minimum 7-year term, renewable indefinitely (India: 10 years)
   - Protection against use of identical/similar marks on similar goods
   - Well-known marks get broader protection
   - No compulsory licensing of trademarks

4. **Madrid System:** Allows international trademark registration through a single application.

5. **Nice Classification:** Organizes goods and services into 45 classes for trademark purposes.

6. **Grounds of Refusal:**
   - **Absolute (Section 9):** Lack of distinctiveness, descriptive, generic, deceptive, prohibited by law
   - **Relative (Section 11):** Conflicts with earlier trademarks

7. **Registration Procedure:** Application → Examination → Publication → Opposition (optional) → Registration.

8. **Non-Conventional Marks:** Shape, sound, color, smell (if distinctive and graphically representable).

9. **Infringement (Section 29):** Unauthorized use of identical/deceptively similar mark on similar goods, likely to cause confusion.

10. **Passing Off:** Common law protection for unregistered marks based on goodwill, misrepresentation, and damage.

11. **Parallel Importation:** India follows international exhaustion - genuine goods can be imported without infringing trademark rights.

12. **Assignment and Licensing:** Trademarks can be assigned (with or without goodwill) and licensed; "permitted use" concept protects licensees.
