# 📖 Module 02: Copyright and Neighbouring Rights

## 📝 1. Understanding Copyright

### What is Copyright?

Copyright is a form of intellectual property protection that gives creators exclusive rights over their original works of authorship. The word "copyright" literally means the "right to copy" - it is the legal right that prevents others from copying your creative work without permission.

Think of copyright as an invisible shield around creative works. When you write a story, compose a song, paint a picture, or create a film, copyright law automatically protects your creation. This protection gives you control over how your work is used and allows you to benefit economically from your creativity.

### Legal Definition

Under the Indian Copyright Act, 1957 (Section 14), copyright refers to a **bundle of exclusive rights** vested in the owner of copyright. These rights can be exercised only by the owner of copyright or by any other person who is duly licensed by the owner.

**Key Points About Copyright:**

- **Automatic Protection:** Copyright protection arises automatically when a work is created and fixed in a tangible form - no registration is required
- **Bundle of Rights:** Copyright is not a single right but a collection of different rights
- **Economic and Moral Rights:** Includes both the right to economically exploit the work and moral rights to protect the creator's reputation
- **Limited Duration:** Copyright protection lasts for a specific period, after which the work enters the public domain
- **Territorial:** Copyright is granted and enforced on a territorial basis, though international treaties provide reciprocal protection

### 💡 Meaning of Originality

Originality is the cornerstone of copyright protection. But what does "original" mean in copyright law? It doesn't mean the work must be novel or unique in the world - it has a specific legal meaning.

#### **What is Originality?**

A work is considered original if it:

**1. Originates from the Author**
- The work must be the author's own intellectual creation
- It should not be copied from someone else
- The author must have created it independently

**2. Involves Minimal Creativity**
- Some minimal degree of creativity or skill is required
- The threshold is low - the work doesn't need to be highly creative or artistic
- Even a simple photograph or compilation can be original

**3. Is Not Merely Mechanical**
- Purely mechanical or automated processes don't create original works
- Some human creative input is necessary
- Example: A photograph taken by a camera automatically triggered by motion is not original, but one composed by a photographer is

#### **What Originality Does NOT Mean**

- **Not Novelty:** The work doesn't need to be new or unprecedented
- **Not High Quality:** Artistic merit or quality is irrelevant - even simple works can be protected
- **Not Uniqueness:** Similar works can each be original if independently created
- **Not Invention:** Unlike patents, copyright doesn't require an inventive step

#### **Examples of Originality**

**Original Works:**
- A photograph where the photographer chose the angle, lighting, and composition
- A compilation of data arranged in a specific, thoughtful order
- A translation that involves creative choices in language
- A simple drawing or sketch that reflects the artist's expression

**Not Original:**
- A photocopy of an existing document
- A mechanical recording without any creative input
- A list of phone numbers arranged alphabetically (no creativity in arrangement)
- Purely factual information without creative expression

#### **Important Case Law: Donoghue v. Allied Newspapers**

This landmark case established an important principle about originality:

**Facts:** A person had a brilliant idea for a story and communicated it to a writer, who then wrote the story.

**Held:** The writer who "clothed the idea in form" (i.e., expressed it in tangible form) became the author and owner of copyright. The person who provided the idea had no rights to the final product.

**Principle:** Copyright exists not in ideas, but in the tangible form in which ideas are expressed. The person who provides the creative expression owns the copyright.

### 🎨 The Idea-Expression Dichotomy

One of the most fundamental principles of copyright law is the distinction between ideas and expression. This is crucial to understand because it defines what copyright actually protects.

#### **The Basic Principle**

**Copyright protects the expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves.**

This means:
- ✅ The way you express an idea is protected
- ❌ The underlying idea itself is not protected
- ✅ The specific words, images, or sounds you use to convey an idea are protected
- ❌ The concept or theme behind your work is not protected

#### **Why This Distinction Exists**

**1. Promotes Progress and Creativity**
- If ideas were protected, creativity would be stifled
- Multiple people should be able to express the same idea differently
- Society benefits from diverse expressions of similar concepts

**2. Balances Rights**
- Protects creators' specific expressions
- Allows others to build upon and develop ideas
- Prevents monopolization of basic concepts

**3. Preserves Free Speech**
- Ideas, facts, and information remain in the public domain
- Everyone can discuss and build upon concepts
- Only the specific creative expression is exclusive

#### **Practical Examples**

**Example 1: Books**
- **Idea (Not Protected):** A story about a school for wizards
- **Expression (Protected):** The specific plot, characters, dialogue, and narrative style of a particular book about a wizard school

This is why multiple books about wizard schools can exist - J.K. Rowling doesn't own the idea of wizard schools, but her specific expression in the Harry Potter books is protected.

**Example 2: Cooking**
- **Idea (Not Protected):** The recipe or method for making a dish
- **Expression (Protected):** The specific written description, photographs, and presentation in a cookbook

This is why recipes themselves cannot be copyrighted, but the cookbook describing them can be.

**Example 3: Art**
- **Idea (Not Protected):** A painting of a sunset
- **Expression (Protected):** The specific colors, brush strokes, composition, and style used in a particular sunset painting

Many artists can paint sunsets, but each artist's specific expression is protected.

**Example 4: Software**
- **Idea (Not Protected):** A program that edits photographs
- **Expression (Protected):** The specific code, user interface, and unique features of a particular photo editing software

#### **The Merger Doctrine**

Sometimes, there are very few or only one way to express an idea. In such cases, the idea and expression "merge," and copyright protection may be limited or denied. This is to prevent someone from monopolizing the idea itself.

**Example:** Mathematical formulas, basic shapes, or standard business forms may not be copyrightable because there are limited ways to express them.

#### **Facts and Copyright**

**Facts are not copyrightable** because they are discovered, not created. However, the way facts are selected, arranged, and presented can be protected.

**Example:**
- ❌ Historical facts about World War II cannot be copyrighted
- ✅ A history book about World War II can be copyrighted (the specific narration, analysis, and presentation)
- ❌ Raw data from research is not protected
- ✅ A creative database arrangement or visualization of that data can be protected

## 🎭 2. Understanding Neighbouring Rights

Neighbouring rights, also called related rights, are rights that are "neighboring" or related to copyright. They protect the rights of persons and entities who contribute to making works available to the public, even if they're not the original creators of the underlying work.

### Who Holds Neighbouring Rights?

**Three main categories of rights holders:**

1. **Performers** (actors, singers, musicians, dancers, etc.)
2. **Producers of Phonograms** (sound recordings)
3. **Broadcasting Organizations** (radio and television broadcasters)

### Why Neighbouring Rights Exist

Copyright protects the creator of a work (like a songwriter or playwright). But what about the performers who bring that work to life, or the producers who record it, or the broadcasters who transmit it? They also invest time, money, and creativity. Neighbouring rights recognize and protect their contributions.

### The Distinction from Copyright

**Copyright:**
- Protects the original creative work itself
- Belongs to the author/creator
- Example: The songwriter owns copyright in the musical composition

**Neighbouring Rights:**
- Protect performances and productions of works
- Belong to performers, producers, and broadcasters
- Example: The singer owns rights in their specific performance of the song

**Both can coexist:** A recorded song has multiple layers of rights:
- Copyright in the musical composition (belongs to the composer)
- Copyright in the lyrics (belongs to the lyricist)
- Neighbouring rights in the performance (belong to the singer)
- Neighbouring rights in the sound recording (belong to the producer)

### 🎤 Performers' Rights

Performers are artists who perform literary, dramatic, musical, or artistic works. Under Indian law (Section 2(qq) of the Copyright Act), a performer includes:

- Actors
- Singers
- Musicians
- Dancers
- Acrobats
- Conjurers
- Snake charmers
- Persons delivering lectures
- Any other person who makes a performance

#### **What Rights Do Performers Have?**

**1. Right to Make Sound Recordings or Visual Recordings**
- Performers have the exclusive right to authorize the recording of their performance
- No one can record a live performance without the performer's permission

**Example:** If you're singing at a concert, someone cannot record your performance and sell CDs without your permission.

**2. Right to Reproduce Recordings**
- Once a performance is recorded, the performer controls reproductions of that recording
- Prevents unauthorized copying of the recorded performance

**3. Right to Broadcast or Communicate**
- Performers can control the broadcasting of their recorded performances
- Includes television, radio, and online streaming

**4. Right to Sell or Commercially Rent Recordings**
- Performers have rights over the commercial distribution of recordings
- Can authorize or prohibit rental of sound or video recordings

**5. Economic Rights**
- Right to receive remuneration when their performances are used
- Can license their rights for payment

**6. Moral Rights of Performers**
- Right to be identified as the performer
- Right to object to distortion or mutilation of the performance that harms their reputation

#### **Duration of Performers' Rights**

Under Indian law, performers' rights last for **50 years** from the beginning of the calendar year following the year in which the performance is made or recorded.

#### **Limitations and Exceptions**

Performers' rights are subject to certain limitations:
- Fair dealing for private use, research, or criticism
- Use for educational purposes
- Reporting current events

### 📻 Broadcasting Organizations' Rights

Broadcasting organizations invest significant resources in transmitting programs to the public. Neighbouring rights recognize this investment.

#### **What is a Broadcast?**

Communication to the public by wireless transmission (radio waves) or transmission through cables, satellite, or similar means.

#### **Rights of Broadcasting Organizations**

Under the Indian Copyright Act (Section 37), broadcasting organizations have the exclusive right to:

**1. Re-broadcast the Broadcast**
- Control re-broadcasting of their original broadcasts
- Other organizations cannot simply retransmit without permission

**2. Cause the Broadcast to be Heard or Seen by Public**
- Control public viewing or listening to their broadcasts
- Example: Preventing unauthorized public screenings in theaters or restaurants

**3. Make Sound Recordings or Visual Recordings**
- Authorize recording of their broadcasts
- Protect against unauthorized recording and distribution

**4. Make Reproductions**
- Control reproduction of recordings of their broadcasts

#### **Duration of Broadcast Rights**

Broadcasting rights last for **25 years** from the beginning of the calendar year following the year in which the broadcast was made.

### 📀 Producers of Phonograms

A phonogram (or sound recording) is any exclusively aural (sound-only) fixation of sounds from a performance or other sounds. The producer is the person who takes the initiative and responsibility for the first fixation of sounds.

#### **Rights of Phonogram Producers**

Producers of phonograms have rights to:
- Control reproduction of their sound recordings
- Control distribution to the public
- Control rental and lending
- Receive remuneration for broadcasting or public communication

### 🌍 International Protection: The Rome Convention (1961)

The **Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations**, adopted in 1961, is the first international treaty specifically addressing neighbouring rights.

#### **Key Features of the Rome Convention**

**1. National Treatment**
- Member countries must grant foreign performers, producers, and broadcasters the same protection as nationals

**2. Minimum Standards**
- Sets minimum levels of protection for performances, phonograms, and broadcasts

**3. Rights Protected:**

**For Performers:**
- Right to prevent unauthorized fixation of live performances
- Right to prevent unauthorized reproduction
- Right to prevent unauthorized broadcasting and public communication

**For Producers of Phonograms:**
- Right to authorize or prohibit reproduction
- Right to remuneration for broadcasting or public communication

**For Broadcasting Organizations:**
- Right to authorize or prohibit rebroadcasting
- Right to authorize or prohibit fixation
- Right to authorize or prohibit reproduction
- Right to authorize or prohibit public communication

**4. Duration**
- Minimum 20 years of protection from the date of fixation or performance

**5. Limitations and Exceptions**
- Allows exceptions for private use, short excerpts in news reporting, teaching, and scientific research

#### **India and the Rome Convention**

India is **not** a signatory to the Rome Convention. However, Indian law provides protection for neighbouring rights through the Copyright Act, 1957, which has been amended to include provisions for performers' rights and broadcast reproduction rights.

### 🎵 WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (1996)

The **WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT)**, adopted in 1996, is a more modern international treaty that updates and extends protection for performers and producers of phonograms in the digital age.

#### **Background**

The WPPT was developed in response to challenges posed by digital technology and the internet:
- Easy digital copying and distribution
- Online streaming and downloads
- Need for international coordination in the digital environment

#### **Key Features of the WPPT**

**1. Enhanced Rights for Performers**

**Economic Rights:**
- Right of reproduction
- Right of distribution
- Right of rental
- **Right of making available** (important for online use) - performers can control on-demand access to their performances over the internet

**Moral Rights:**
- Right to be identified as the performer
- Right to object to any distortion or other modification that would harm their reputation

**2. Rights for Producers of Phonograms**
- Right of reproduction
- Right of distribution
- Right of rental
- Right of making available (for online distribution)

**3. Technological Protection Measures**
- Requires protection against circumvention of technological measures (like DRM - Digital Rights Management)
- Prohibits removal or alteration of electronic rights management information

**4. Duration**
- Minimum 50 years from the end of the year of fixation or performance

**5. Obligations and Exceptions**
- Members must provide legal remedies against infringement
- Allows exceptions for fair use, private copying, educational use, etc.

#### **Significance of WPPT**

- **Digital Age Adaptation:** Addresses challenges of digital copying and online distribution
- **Stronger Protection:** Provides more comprehensive rights than the Rome Convention
- **International Harmonization:** Creates more uniform standards across countries
- **Technology Protection:** Recognizes importance of technological measures in protecting rights

#### **India and the WPPT**

India became a party to the WPPT in 2018. This required amendments to the Copyright Act to incorporate provisions on:
- Making available rights
- Technological protection measures
- Rights management information

## 🌐 3. Copyright and Neighbouring Rights under the TRIPS Agreement

The TRIPS Agreement includes important provisions on copyright and neighbouring rights in Articles 9-14. These provisions build upon existing international conventions while setting minimum standards for all WTO members.

### Article 9: Relation to the Berne Convention

**Key Points:**

**1. Incorporation of Berne Convention**
- WTO members must comply with Articles 1-21 of the Berne Convention (except moral rights)
- This incorporates basic copyright principles into the international trade framework

**2. Idea-Expression Dichotomy**
- Article 9.2 explicitly states that copyright protection extends to expressions, not ideas, procedures, methods of operation, or mathematical concepts
- This clarifies a fundamental copyright principle at the international level

### Article 10: Computer Programs and Compilations of Data

**1. Computer Programs**
- Must be protected as literary works under the Berne Convention
- Source code and object code are both protected
- This was crucial as some countries didn't previously protect software

**2. Databases**
- Compilations of data (databases) are protected if they constitute intellectual creations by reason of selection or arrangement
- Protection doesn't extend to the data itself, only the creative arrangement

**Significance:** These provisions were important for the software and information technology industries, ensuring international protection for computer programs.

### Article 11: Rental Rights

**Key Requirements:**

**1. Computer Programs**
- Authors must have the right to authorize or prohibit commercial rental of their programs
- Exception: Where the program itself is not the essential object of the rental (e.g., renting a car that happens to contain software)

**2. Cinematographic Works**
- Similar rental rights must be provided unless rental has not led to widespread copying that materially impairs the right of reproduction

**Rationale:** Rental can lead to unauthorized copying, so creators need control over rental to protect their economic interests.

### Article 12: Term of Protection

**Minimum Standards:**

**1. Works Calculated on Life of Natural Person**
- Protection must last at least the life of the author plus 50 years

**2. Works Not Calculated on Life**
- If protection is not calculated on the life of a person, the term must be at least 50 years from the end of the calendar year of authorized publication
- Or, if no authorized publication occurs within 50 years of creation, at least 50 years from the end of the calendar year of creation

**Significance:** Harmonizes protection periods across countries, ensuring creators have long-term protection.

### Article 13: Limitations and Exceptions

TRIPS uses the **three-step test** for determining permissible exceptions to copyright:

**The Three Steps:**

**1. Confined to Certain Special Cases**
- Exceptions must be limited to specific, justified circumstances
- Cannot be broad or general

**2. Do Not Conflict with Normal Exploitation**
- The exception must not interfere with the copyright holder's ability to economically exploit the work
- Normal ways of making money from the work must remain protected

**3. Do Not Unreasonably Prejudice Legitimate Interests**
- Must not unfairly harm the copyright holder's legitimate interests
- Balance between public access and creator's rights

**Examples of Permissible Exceptions:**
- Fair use for criticism, commentary, and research
- Educational use
- Library and archival reproductions
- Quotations
- Private copying (in limited circumstances)

### Article 14: Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms, and Broadcasting Organizations

**1. Performers' Rights (Article 14.1)**
- Prevent unauthorized fixation of their performance on a phonogram
- Prevent reproduction of such fixations
- Prevent broadcasting and communication to the public of their live performances

Duration: At least 50 years

**2. Producers of Phonograms (Article 14.2)**
- Right to authorize or prohibit direct or indirect reproduction
- If members provide remuneration for broadcasting or communication to the public, it must be based on a single equitable remuneration

Duration: At least 50 years from fixation

**3. Broadcasting Organizations (Article 14.3)**
- Right to prohibit unauthorized fixation, reproduction of fixations, and rebroadcasting

Duration: At least 20 years from broadcast

**4. Limitations (Article 14.6)**
- Same three-step test applies to limitations on neighbouring rights

### Impact of TRIPS on Copyright Law

**For Developing Countries:**
- Required significant updates to copyright laws
- Mandated protection for computer programs and databases
- Extended protection periods in some cases

**For International Trade:**
- Linked copyright protection to trade benefits
- Created enforcement mechanisms through WTO dispute settlement
- Established minimum global standards

**For India:**
- Led to amendments in the Copyright Act (1994, 1999, 2012)
- Incorporated protection for computer programs
- Strengthened enforcement provisions
- Adapted to digital challenges

### 📋 Subject Matter of Copyright (Section 13)

Copyright subsists throughout India in the following classes of works:

**1. Original Literary, Dramatic, Musical and Artistic Works**

**Conditions:**
- The work must be original (as we discussed earlier)
- Must be fixed in some material form

**Protection Extends To:**
- The expression, not the idea
- Derivative works (translations, adaptations) are also protected as independent works

**2. Cinematograph Films**

**Includes:**
- Movies

**Protection:**
- Protects the film as a whole
- Separate from protection of underlying scripts, music, etc.

**3. Sound Recordings**

**Includes:**
- Music recordings
- Audiobooks
- Podcasts
- Any recording of sounds

**Note:** Protection of the sound recording is separate from copyright in the underlying musical or literary work

### Conditions for Copyright Protection

For copyright to subsist in India, one of the following conditions must be met:

**1. For Unpublished Works:**
- The author is a citizen of India, OR
- The author is domiciled in India, OR
- The author is first published in India

**2. For Published Works:**

**6. For Works of Foreign Authors:**
- If the work is first published in a country that has reciprocal agreements with India

### 👤 Authorship and Ownership of Copyright (Sections 2(d), 16, 17)

Understanding who owns copyright is crucial because ownership determines who can exercise the exclusive rights.

#### **Author vs. Owner**

These terms are related but distinct:

- **Author:** The person who creates the work (as defined in Section 2(d))
- **Owner:** The person who holds the copyright in the work

Usually, the author is the first owner, but there are important exceptions.

#### **First Ownership of Copyright (Section 17)**

**General Rule:**
The author of a work is the first owner of copyright in the work.

**Exceptions:**

**1. Works Made in the Course of Employment**

If a work is created by an employee in the course of their employment under a **contract of service or apprenticeship**, the employer is the first owner (unless there is an agreement to the contrary).

**Key Elements:**
- Must be a contract of service (employment), not a contract for services (independent contractor)
- Work must be created during the course of employment
- Within the scope of duties

**Example:** A software developer employed by a company writes code as part of their job - the company owns the copyright, not the developer.

**Exception to the Exception:** Newspaper, magazine, and periodical works - the author retains rights to publish the work in book form or other form

**2. Photographs, Paintings, and Portraits Made for Valuable Consideration**

If a person commissions another to take a photograph, paint a portrait, or engrave for valuable consideration (payment), the person who commissions the work is the first owner.

**Example:** You hire a photographer for your wedding. You own the copyright in the wedding photos, not the photographer (unless your contract says otherwise).

**3. Works Made by Government or International Organizations**

- Government works: The government is the first owner
- Works of public undertakings: The undertaking is the first owner
- Works of international organizations: The organization is the first owner

**4. Cinematograph Films**

- The producer of the film is the author and first owner (Section 2(d)(v))
- However, creators of underlying works (script, music, etc.) retain copyright in those works

**5. Sound Recordings**

- The producer of the sound recording is the author and first owner
- But composers and lyricists retain copyright in the musical and literary works

#### **Assignment and Transfer of Copyright**

Ownership can be transferred through:

**1. Assignment:** Transfer of copyright ownership
**2. License:** Permission to use the work while ownership remains with the original owner
**3. Transmission:** Transfer by operation of law (inheritance, bankruptcy, etc.)

### 📝 Registration of Copyright (Sections 44-50)

In India, copyright registration is **optional**. Copyright arises automatically upon creation and fixation of the work. However, registration provides certain benefits.

#### **Copyright Office**

The Copyright Office, under the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (formerly DIPP), administers copyright registration in India.

#### **Benefits of Registration**

**1. Prima Facie Evidence**
- Registration certificate serves as prima facie evidence of ownership in court
- Simplifies proof of ownership in infringement cases

**2. Public Notice**
- Puts the world on notice of your claim to copyright
- Deters potential infringers

**3. Statutory Rights**
- Required before filing an infringement suit in some jurisdictions

**4. Licensing and Transfer**
- Facilitates licensing and transfer by clearly establishing ownership

#### **Registration Procedure**

**1. Application**
- Filed on Form XIV prescribed under the Copyright Rules
- Must include particulars of the work, author, and applicant

**2. Diary Number**
- Application is given a diary number and date

**3. Examination**
- Copyright Office examines the application
- May raise objections or seek clarifications

**4. Publication**
- Details published in the Copyright Journal

**5. Opposition Period**
- 30 days for interested parties to oppose

**6. Registration**
- If no opposition or opposition is rejected, registration is granted
- Certificate issued

#### **Documents Required**

- Completed application form
- Copy of the work (manuscript, recording, etc.)
- Proof of authorship/ownership
- Power of attorney (if filed through an agent)
- Prescribed fees

#### **Timeline**

Typically takes 12-18 months, but can vary.

### ⏳ Term of Copyright (Sections 22-29)

Copyright protection doesn't last forever. The duration varies depending on the type of work.

#### **For Literary, Dramatic, Musical, and Artistic Works (Section 22)**

**Published During Author's Lifetime:**
- Life of the author + 60 years from the beginning of the calendar year following the year of author's death

**Example:** If an author publishes a novel in 2020 and dies in 2050, copyright lasts until December 31, 2110 (60 years after 2050).

**Published After Author's Death:**
- 60 years from the beginning of the calendar year following the year of publication

**Anonymous and Pseudonymous Works (Section 23):**
- 60 years from the beginning of the calendar year following the year of publication

#### **For Cinematograph Films (Section 25)**

- 60 years from the beginning of the calendar year following the year of publication

#### **For Sound Recordings (Section 26)**

- 60 years from the beginning of the calendar year following the year of publication

#### **After Copyright Expires**

When copyright expires, the work enters the **public domain**:
- Anyone can use the work freely
- No permission needed
- No royalties payable
- Moral rights may still apply in some jurisdictions

### 📄 Assignment, Transmission, and Licenses

Copyright can be transferred or licensed to others. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for commercializing creative works.

#### **Assignment of Copyright (Sections 18-19)**

Assignment means transferring ownership of copyright from one person to another.

**Requirements for Valid Assignment:**

**1. Must be in Writing**
- Oral assignments are not valid
- Must be signed by the assignor or their authorized agent

**2. Must Specify Rights**
- The specific rights being assigned must be identified
- Can assign all rights or only some rights (e.g., only translation rights)

**3. Must Specify Territory**
- The geographical area for which rights are assigned
- Can be India, a specific state, worldwide, etc.

**4. Must Specify Period**
- The duration of the assignment
- Cannot exceed the copyright term

**5. Must Specify Royalty**
- The amount of royalty payable (if any)
- Can be a lump sum, percentage, or other arrangement
- If no royalty specified in the case of future works, assignee must give prior notice and the author can fix a reasonable royalty

**Example:** An author assigns the right to publish their book in India for 10 years to a publisher for a 10% royalty on sales.

**Assignor's Rights:**
- If the assignor doesn't exercise assigned rights, the author can revoke the assignment (after notice)
- Author retains rights not assigned

#### **Transmission of Copyright (Section 20)**

Transmission means transfer of ownership by operation of law, not by agreement:

**Modes of Transmission:**
- **Testamentary Disposition:** Through a will
- **Intestate Succession:** When someone dies without a will, copyright passes to legal heirs
- **Corporate Succession:** If a company holding copyright is acquired or merged

#### **Licenses**

A license grants permission to use a work while ownership remains with the licensor. Licenses can be exclusive or non-exclusive.

**Types of Licenses:**

##### **1. Voluntary Licenses**

These are licenses granted voluntarily by the copyright owner, typically through negotiation.

**Features:**
- Terms negotiated between parties
- Can be exclusive or non-exclusive
- License fees determined by agreement

##### **2. Statutory Licenses (Sections 31-32, 52)**

These are licenses provided for in the Copyright Act for specific purposes.

**Examples:**
- **Broadcasting License (Section 31):** Once a sound recording is made with the owner's consent, broadcasters can use it for broadcast on payment of royalties
- **Cover Versions (Section 31-A):** Once a sound recording of a musical work is made, others can make their own versions on payment of royalties
- **Reprographic Reproduction for Educational Purposes (Section 52(1)(i)):** Educational institutions can make copies for teaching purposes

##### **3. Compulsory Licenses (Sections 31, 31A, 31B, 31C)**

In certain situations, the law allows third parties to obtain a license even without the copyright owner's consent, on payment of reasonable royalties.

**When Compulsory Licenses Can Be Granted:**

**Section 31 - General Compulsory License:**

After 3 years from publication, a compulsory license can be granted if:
- The work is not made available to the public at a reasonable price, OR
- The work is withheld from the public

**Procedure:**
- Application to the Copyright Board
- Copyright Board considers whether:
  - Author's reasonable interests are protected

## 🤝 5. Copyright Societies and Recognition of International Copyright

### Copyright Societies (Sections 33-35)

Copyright societies, also called collective management organizations, play a vital role in administering copyright, especially for works that are widely used (like music).

#### **What is a Copyright Society?**

A copyright society is a registered organization under Section 33 of the Copyright Act that represents multiple copyright owners and administers their rights collectively.

#### **Purpose and Function**

**Why Copyright Societies Exist:**

Individual copyright owners, especially creators of musical works, cannot practically monitor and collect royalties for every use of their work. Copyright societies solve this problem by:

- **Collective Administration:** Managing rights for numerous creators
- **Licensing:** Issuing blanket licenses to users (radio stations, restaurants, streaming services)
- **Collection:** Collecting license fees
- **Distribution:** Distributing royalties to members
- **Enforcement:** Monitoring and taking action against infringement

**Example:** A restaurant plays music for its customers. Instead of obtaining permission from each songwriter and composer individually (which would be impractical), the restaurant obtains a blanket license from a copyright society, which then distributes the collected fees to its members based on usage.

#### **Registration Requirements**

**Who Can Form a Society:**
- Minimum **seven** members (authors, publishers, or other copyright owners)
- Society must be registered with the Copyright Office

**Application Process:**
- Apply on prescribed form to Registrar of Copyrights
- Provide details of objectives, members, and proposed operations
- Submit copies of rules and regulations
- Pay prescribed fees

**Registrar's Approval:**
- Registrar examines whether the society can effectively administer rights
- May grant registration with or without conditions
- Registration can be refused if the society doesn't meet requirements

#### **Rights and Responsibilities**

**Rights of Copyright Societies:**
- **Issue Licenses:** Can license public performance, broadcasting, and other uses of members' works
- **Collect Fees:** Collect license fees and royalties
- **Take Legal Action:** Can sue for infringement on behalf of members
- **Represent Members:** Act as collective voice for creators

**Responsibilities:**
- **Transparency:** Maintain proper accounts and records
- **Fair Distribution:** Distribute collected fees fairly among members
- **Reporting:** Submit annual reports to the Registrar
- **Compliance:** Follow Copyright Act and their own rules
- **Non-discrimination:** Cannot refuse membership arbitrarily

#### **Supervision by Copyright Board**

The Copyright Board has oversight powers:
- Resolve disputes between societies and users or members
- Review license fees and ensure they're reasonable
- Investigate complaints
- Can suspend or cancel registration for violations

#### **Copyright Societies in India**

Several copyright societies operate in India:

**1. IPRS (Indian Performing Right Society Limited)**
- Represents composers, lyricists, and publishers of musical works
- Issues licenses for public performance and broadcast of music

**2. PPL (Phonographic Performance Limited)**
- Represents producers of sound recordings
- Licenses broadcasting and public performance of recorded music

**3. IPRS (Indian Reprographic Rights Organisation)**
- Represents publishers, authors, and visual artists
- Issues licenses for reprographic reproduction

**4. ISRA (Indian Singers' Rights Association)**
- Represents singers
- Administers performers' rights

### Recognition of International Copyright (Sections 40-43)

Copyright is territorial - it's granted and enforced by individual countries. However, international treaties and agreements provide for reciprocal recognition.

#### **How International Copyright Works**

**General Principle:**
Copyright protection in one country doesn't automatically provide protection in other countries. However, international conventions (Berne, TRIPS) provide mechanisms for reciprocal protection.

#### **Notification Under Section 40**

The Indian government can issue notifications extending copyright protection to:
- Works first published in countries that are parties to international copyright conventions
- Works of authors who are nationals of such countries

**Effect of Notification:**
Once notified, works from those countries receive the same protection in India as Indian works (national treatment principle).

#### **Countries Covered**

India provides reciprocal protection to countries that are:
- Parties to the Berne Convention
- WTO members (under TRIPS)
- Countries with bilateral agreements with India

This means works from these countries are protected in India as if they were Indian works.

#### **Procedure for Protection**

**For Foreign Authors:**
- No special registration required in India
- Protection is automatic under international conventions
- Same rights as Indian authors

**Enforcing Rights:**
- Foreign authors can enforce their rights in Indian courts
- Can register with Indian Copyright Office for additional evidence

#### **Limitations**

- **Formalities:** While Berne prohibits formalities, some practical issues may arise (proving authorship, etc.)
- **Exceptions:** Indian law's exceptions apply to foreign works too
- **Public Domain:** If a work is in the public domain in its country of origin, it's generally not protected in India either

#### **Importance for India**

**Benefits:**
- Indian authors' works are protected internationally
- Facilitates international trade in creative works
- Attracts foreign investment in creative industries
- Promotes cultural exchange

**Challenges:**
- Balancing protection with access, especially for educational materials
- Enforcement against online infringement from abroad
- Addressing piracy

## ⚖️ 6. Economic and Moral Rights Conferred by Copyright

Copyright is often described as a "bundle of rights." These rights fall into two main categories: economic rights and moral rights.

### 💰 Economic Rights (Section 14)

Economic rights allow the copyright owner to derive financial benefit from the use of their work. These are also called "exploitation rights."

#### **Rights Vary by Type of Work**

**For Literary, Dramatic, or Musical Works (Section 14(a)):**

**1. Right to Reproduce the Work**
- Make copies in any material form
- Includes photocopying, printing, recording, digital copying
- Covers any method of reproduction

**Example:** Publishing a book, making photocopies, creating digital files

**2. Right to Issue Copies to the Public**
- First sale or distribution
- Putting the work in circulation

**Important:** This is subject to the exhaustion principle - once a copy is sold, the owner can't control its resale

**3. Right to Perform the Work in Public**
- Includes live performances, screenings, readings
- "Public" means beyond private or domestic circle

**Example:** Staging a play, giving a public reading of a poem

**4. Right to Communicate the Work to the Public**
- Broadcasting
- Making available online
- Any electronic transmission

**Example:** Broadcasting a song on radio, streaming a movie online

**5. Right to Make Adaptation**
- Convert to another form
- Translate
- Rearrange

**Example:** Adapting a novel into a movie script, translating a book into another language

**6. Right to Do Any of the Above in Respect of an Adaptation**
- If you create an authorized adaptation, you control its exploitation too

**For Artistic Works (Section 14(c)):**

Similar rights, with some specific additions:
- Right to reproduce in any material form
- Right to communicate to the public
- Right to issue copies
- Right to include the work in a cinematograph film
- Right to make any adaptation

**For Cinematograph Films (Section 14(d)):**
- Right to make copies
- Right to sell or give on hire
- Right to communicate to the public

**For Sound Recordings (Section 14(e)):**
- Right to make copies
- Right to sell or give on commercial rental
- Right to communicate to the public

#### **Exclusive Nature of Economic Rights**

"Exclusive" means:
- Only the copyright owner can exercise these rights
- Anyone else needs permission (license)
- Unauthorized exercise is infringement

#### **Transferability**

Economic rights can be:
- Assigned (transferred permanently)
- Licensed (permission granted while retaining ownership)
- Divided (e.g., translate rights to one person, film rights to another)
- Limited (by territory, duration, or medium)

### 🎨 Moral Rights (Section 57)

Moral rights protect the personal and reputational interests of the author. Unlike economic rights, moral rights are:
- Non-transferable (remain with the author even if copyright is sold)
- Personal to the author
- Recognized in the Berne Convention and Indian law

#### **Two Main Moral Rights**

**1. Right of Paternity (Right of Attribution)**

The author has the right to:
- **Claim authorship** of the work
- **Be identified** as the author when the work is used
- **Prevent false attribution** (someone else claiming to be the author)

**Practical Implications:**
- Author's name must appear on copies, in credits, in publicity
- Even if copyright is sold, the author's name must be acknowledged
- Others cannot claim to be the author

**Example:** If you write a screenplay and sell it to a studio, your name must appear in the film's credits. The studio cannot claim it wrote the screenplay.

**2. Right of Integrity**

The author has the right to:
- **Prevent distortion, mutilation, or modification** of the work
- **Object to any treatment** that would be prejudicial to their honor or reputation

**Practical Implications:**
- Work cannot be altered in ways that harm the author's reputation
- Colorization of black-and-white films, editing of novels, changes to artworks may violate this right
- The alteration must be prejudicial - minor edits may be acceptable

**Example:** If you paint a picture and sell it, the buyer cannot paint over parts of it or modify it in a way that misrepresents your artistic vision or harms your reputation as an artist.

#### **Duration of Moral Rights**

Moral rights last for the **same duration as economic rights**:
- Life of author + 60 years

After the author's death, moral rights can be enforced by:
- The author's legal representatives
- Persons authorized by the author

#### **Waiver of Moral Rights**

In some jurisdictions, moral rights can be waived (author can agree not to enforce them). Indian law is silent on this, leading to debates:
- Some argue moral rights are inalienable and cannot be waived
- Others say authors can contractually agree not to enforce them
- Courts have not definitively settled this issue

**Practical Consideration:** Contracts often include clauses where authors acknowledge modifications may occur, though the legal enforceability is debatable.

#### **Moral Rights and Commercial Realities**

Moral rights can sometimes conflict with commercial exploitation:

**Examples:**
- Film studios want to edit purchased scripts
- Publishers want to edit novels
- Advertisers want to modify licensed music or images

**Balance:**
- Contracts typically address how works can be modified
- "Reasonable" modifications for medium or format are usually acceptable
- Major changes that distort the work or harm reputation are not

### 🚪 Exceptions to Copyright Protection

While copyright grants exclusive rights, these rights are not absolute. The law recognizes situations where using copyrighted works without permission is justified. These are called exceptions or limitations.

#### **Why Exceptions Exist**

Exceptions balance:
- **Creator's rights** to control and benefit from their work
- **Public interest** in access to information, education, and culture
- **Follow-on creativity** that builds on existing works
- **Freedom of expression** and criticism

#### **Categories of Exceptions**

**1. Fair Dealing (Section 52(1)(a))**

"Fair dealing" is use of a copyrighted work for specified purposes that doesn't require permission.

**Permitted Purposes:**
- **Private or personal use** (including research)
- **Criticism or review** (of that work or another)
- **Reporting of current events** (in newspapers, magazines, broadcasts)

**What Makes Dealing "Fair":**

The Act doesn't define "fair," but courts consider:
- **Purpose and Character:** Is it transformative? Is it commercial?
- **Nature of the Work:** Factual works have broader fair use
- **Amount Used:** How much of the work is used? (Both quantitatively and qualitatively)
- **Effect on Market:** Does the use harm the copyright owner's market?

**Examples:**
- ✅ Quoting a few paragraphs from a book in a research paper
- ✅ Reviewing a film and showing clips for illustration
- ✅ Reporting news and quoting from copyrighted sources
- ❌ Copying an entire textbook for "personal use"
- ❌ Using most of a song in a commercial parody

**2. Educational Use (Section 52(1)(h), (i), (j))**

**Performance in Educational Institutions (52(1)(h)):**
- Performance of a work by teachers and students in educational institutions
- Must be in the course of educational instruction
- Audience must be limited to teachers, students, and other directly connected persons
- No admission fee charged

**Example:** A drama class performs a play; a music class performs a song.

**Reprographic Reproduction (52(1)(i)):**
- Educational institutions can make copies for teaching purposes
- Subject to reasonable restrictions (not wholesale copying of textbooks)

**Reading or Recitation (52(1)(j)):**
- Public reading or recitation of reasonable extracts
- Accompaniment by sound recording is allowed if the recording was lawfully made

**3. Library and Archive Exceptions (Section 52(1)(n), (o), (p))**

Libraries can:
- Make copies for preservation
- Replace lost or damaged copies
- Supply copies to other libraries
- Make copies for users if the work is not available for purchase

**Conditions:**
- Must be non-profit library
- Purpose is preservation or research
- No multiple copies to the same person

**4. Judicial Proceedings and Legislative Reports (Section 52(1)(q), (r))**

Copyright is not infringed by:
- Reproduction of works in judicial proceedings
- Report of Commission, Committee, or Court proceedings
- Legislative body reports

**Rationale:** Public interest in access to legal and governmental information

**5. Computer Program Exceptions (Section 52(1)(aa), (ab), (ac))**

**Making Backup Copies:**
- A lawful owner of a computer program can make backup copies for personal use

**Reverse Engineering:**
- Observing, studying, or testing a program to understand its ideas and principles
- Necessary for interoperability

**6. Works in Public Premises (Section 52(1)(v))**

Copyright is not infringed by making a painting, drawing, engraving, or photograph of:
- A work of architecture
- A sculpture or other artistic work permanently displayed in a public place

**Example:** You can take photos of public statues or buildings and share them.

**7. Importation (Section 52(1)(m))**

Importing one copy of a work for private and domestic use doesn't infringe copyright.

**8. Other Exceptions**

The Act includes numerous other exceptions:
- Incidental inclusion of works in other works
- Ephemeral recordings by broadcasters
- Use for persons with disabilities
- Performances by amateur clubs
- Reconstruction of buildings

#### **Three-Step Test**

As per TRIPS Article 13, exceptions must satisfy the three-step test:
1. Limited to certain special cases
2. Do not conflict with normal exploitation
3. Do not unreasonably prejudice legitimate interests

Indian courts increasingly apply this test when interpreting exceptions.

---

## 🚫 7. Infringement and Protection

### What is Copyright Infringement?

Copyright infringement occurs when someone exercises any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner without permission, and without falling under an exception.

**Basic Test for Infringement:**
1. Is there a valid copyright?
2. Did the defendant copy the work?
3. Is the copying substantial?
4. Is there a defense or exception?

### 📋 Types of Infringement

#### **Direct Infringement (Section 51(a)(i))**

Direct infringement occurs when a person does any act that only the copyright owner has the right to do, without authorization.

**Examples:**
- Reproducing a book without permission
- Broadcasting a film without license
- Making and selling pirated copies of music
- Uploading a copyrighted video to the internet

**Key Element:**
- Actual copying or unauthorized use
- Doesn't require knowledge that it's infringement
- Strict liability - intent doesn't matter

#### **Indirect Infringement (Section 51(a)(ii))**

Indirect infringement involves dealing with infringing copies.

**Acts Constituting Indirect Infringement:**
- **Importation** of infringing copies (except for personal use)
- **Sale** or rental of infringing copies
- **Distribution** for commercial purposes
- **Public exhibition** of infringing copies
- **Possession** for trade or business

**Example:** Selling pirated DVDs, even if you didn't make the pirated copies yourself.

**Key Element:**
- Knowledge or reason to believe the copies are infringing
- Commercial dealing with infringing copies

#### **Secondary Infringement / Contributory Infringement**

Though not explicitly defined, Indian courts recognize secondary infringement:

**1. Contributory Infringement:**
- Knowingly inducing, causing, or materially contributing to infringing conduct by another

**Example:** A website that facilitates illegal downloads by linking to pirated content.

**2. Vicarious Infringement:**
- Having the right and ability to supervise the infringing activity
- Having a direct financial interest in the infringement

**Example:** A venue that allows pirated content to be shown, knowing about it and profiting from it.

### 📱 Technological Protection Measures and Digital Rights Management

The 2012 amendment to the Copyright Act introduced provisions to protect technological measures in the digital age.

#### **What are Technological Protection Measures (TPM)?**

TPMs are technologies used to control access to or use of copyrighted works.

**Examples:**
- Encryption on DVDs
- Password protection on e-books
- Digital watermarks
- Access controls on streaming services
- Copy protection on software

**Purpose:**
- Prevent unauthorized access
- Prevent unauthorized copying
- Control distribution
- Track use

#### **Legal Protection for TPMs (Section 65A)**

The Copyright Act makes it illegal to:
- **Circumvent** technological protection measures
- **Manufacture or deal** in devices designed to circumvent TPMs
- **Provide services** for circumvention

**What This Means:**
Even if you own a copy of a work, you generally cannot break its protection measures, even for otherwise legal uses.

**Example:** It's illegal to break encryption on a DVD you bought, even to make a backup copy for personal use.

#### **Exceptions to TPM Provisions (Section 65A(2))**

Circumvention is allowed for:
- Testing computer security
- Conducting encryption research
- Reverse engineering for interoperability
- Use by persons with disabilities
- Government use

#### **Rights Management Information (Section 65B)**

RMI is information embedded in copies that identifies:
- The work
- The copyright owner
- Terms and conditions of use

**Protection:**
It's illegal to:
- Remove or alter RMI
- Distribute works with RMI removed or altered
- Do so knowingly and with intent to facilitate infringement

**Example:** Removing a photographer's watermark from a photo or author's name from a digital document.

#### **Criticisms and Debates**

**Concerns About TPMs:**
- Can restrict legitimate fair use
- May lock content to specific platforms
- Can prevent preservation and archiving
- Technical measures may be overprotective compared to legal rights

**Balance:**
The law tries to balance protection with legitimate uses, but debates continue about whether the balance is right.

### 🆚 Plagiarism vs. Copyright Infringement

While often confused, plagiarism and copyright infringement are distinct concepts:

| **Aspect** | **Copyright Infringement** | **Plagiarism** |
|------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| **Nature** | Legal violation | Ethical violation |
| **Definition** | Using copyrighted work without permission | Presenting someone else's work as your own |
| **Scope** | Applies only to copyrighted works | Applies to any work, even public domain |
| **Permission** | Permission cures infringement | Permission doesn't cure plagiarism |
| **Attribution** | Attribution doesn't cure infringement (still need permission) | Attribution cures plagiarism |
| **Consequences** | Legal remedies, damages, injunctions | Academic/professional sanctions, reputation damage |
| **Governed By** | Copyright law | Academic/professional codes of conduct |

#### **Examples:**

**Copyright Infringement but Not Plagiarism:**
- You copy an entire book and publish it under the original author's name (infringement, but you're not claiming it as yours)

**Plagiarism but Not Copyright Infringement:**
- You copy text from a public domain work and present it as your own (no copyright issue since it's public domain, but still plagiarism)

**Both:**
- You copy substantial portions of a copyrighted book and present it as your own work (most common scenario in academic dishonesty)

**Neither:**
- You properly cite and quote small portions for criticism or research (fair use, properly attributed)

#### **In Academic Contexts**

**Avoiding Plagiarism:**
- Always attribute sources
- Use quotation marks for direct quotes
- Paraphrase properly (don't just change a few words)
- Cite all sources

**Avoiding Infringement:**
- Use only public domain or openly licensed works for substantial copying
- Rely on fair use exceptions
- Get permission for uses beyond fair use
- Create original content

### ⚖️ Remedies Against Infringement

When copyright is infringed, the owner has several legal remedies available:

#### **Civil Remedies (Sections 55-62)**

**1. Injunction (Section 55)**

An injunction is a court order directing the infringer to stop the infringing activity.

**Types:**
- **Interim/Temporary Injunction:** Quick relief during trial to prevent ongoing harm
- **Permanent Injunction:** Final order after trial prohibiting future infringement

**When Granted:**
- Prima facie case established
- Balance of convenience favors plaintiff
- Irreparable harm without injunction

**Example:** Court orders a website to stop distributing pirated copies of a film.

**2. Damages (Section 55)**

Monetary compensation for harm suffered due to infringement.

**Types of Damages:**

**a) Compensatory Damages:**
- Actual loss suffered by the copyright owner
- Profits lost due to infringement

**b) Statutory Damages:**
- Up to ₹2,00,000 per work infringed (as per recent amendments)
- Court determines amount based on severity

**c) Conversion Damages (Account of Profits):**
- Infringer must pay over profits made from infringement
- Alternative to compensatory damages

**Factors Courts Consider:**
- Nature and seriousness of infringement
- Whether infringement was willful
- Financial harm to copyright owner
- Profits made by infringer
- Need for deterrence

**3. Delivery/Seizure of Infringing Copies (Section 58)**

Court can order:
- Delivery up of infringing copies to the copyright owner
- Destruction of infringing copies
- Seizure of materials used to make infringing copies

**Purpose:** Remove infringing materials from circulation.

**4. Cost of Litigation**

Successful plaintiff can recover legal costs from the defendant.

#### **Criminal Remedies (Sections 63-70)**

Copyright infringement can also be a criminal offense if it's:
- Knowingly done
- For commercial purposes

**Penalties:**

**For First Offense:**
- Imprisonment: Minimum 6 months, up to 3 years
- Fine: Minimum ₹50,000, up to ₹2,00,000

**For Subsequent Offenses:**
- Imprisonment: Minimum 1 year, up to 3 years
- Fine: Minimum ₹1,00,000, up to ₹2,00,000

**Additional Criminal Provisions:**

**Knowingly Making Infringing Copies for Sale (Section 63):**
- Criminal liability for deliberate commercial infringement

**Knowingly Selling Infringing Copies (Section 63):**
- Dealers in pirated goods can be prosecuted

**Possession of Infringing Copies for Business (Section 63):**
- Even possession for commercial purposes is criminal

**Punishment for Contraventions of Other Provisions (Section 63-A):**
- Violating performers' rights, circumventing TPMs, etc.
- Lesser penalties than direct infringement

**Police Powers:**
- Police can seize infringing copies without warrant (Section 64)
- Can investigate and prosecute

**Cognizability:**
- Generally, copyright infringement is a cognizable offense
- Police can investigate without court order

#### **Administrative Remedies**

**1. Border Measures:**
- Customs authorities can seize imported infringing copies
- Copyright owner can request customs to watch for imports

**2. Internet Service Provider (ISP) Liability:**
- ISPs must take down infringing content upon notice
- Safe harbor provisions protect ISPs if they act promptly

**3. Copyright Board:**
- Can hear disputes about licensing, royalties, etc.
- Provides alternative to court litigation for some issues

#### **Practical Enforcement Challenges**

**Proof:**
- Proving copying occurred (especially for digital infringement)
- Proving access to the original work
- Establishing substantial similarity

**Digital Infringement:**
- Anonymity of infringers online
- Cross-border infringement (jurisdictional issues)
- Scale of infringement (millions of downloads)

**Costs:**
- Litigation is expensive
- May not be economical for small-scale infringement

**Solutions:**
- Technological measures (TPMs, content ID systems)
- Takedown notices (DMCA-style processes)
- Alternative dispute resolution
- Copyright education and awareness

## 🔑 Key Takeaways from Module 02

1. **Copyright** protects original works of authorship, giving creators exclusive rights over reproduction, distribution, performance, and adaptation of their works.

2. **Originality** means the work originates from the author and involves minimal creativity - it doesn't require novelty or high artistic merit.

3. **Idea-Expression Dichotomy:** Copyright protects expressions, not ideas. This allows multiple people to express similar ideas differently.

4. **Neighbouring Rights** protect performers, producers of sound recordings, and broadcasters who contribute to making works available to the public.

5. **International Protection:**
   - **Rome Convention (1961):** First treaty on neighbouring rights
   - **WPPT (1996):** Enhanced protection for digital age
   - **TRIPS (Articles 9-14):** Minimum standards for copyright and neighbouring rights

6. **Indian Copyright Act, 1957:**
   - Protects literary, dramatic, musical, artistic works, films, and sound recordings
   - Registration is optional but beneficial
   - Protection lasts life + 60 years for most works
   - Assignments and licenses must meet specific requirements

7. **Economic Rights** allow copyright owners to control and profit from exploitation of their works.

8. **Moral Rights** protect the author's reputation and connection to their work - these cannot be transferred.

9. **Exceptions** allow certain uses without permission (fair dealing, education, libraries, etc.) to balance private rights with public interest.

10. **Infringement** occurs when exclusive rights are violated; remedies include injunctions, damages, and criminal penalties.

11. **Digital Age Challenges:** TPMs and RMI protect works technologically, but raise concerns about overprotection and legitimate use.

12. **Copyright vs. Plagiarism:** Copyright infringement is a legal violation; plagiarism is an ethical violation. They're related but distinct.
