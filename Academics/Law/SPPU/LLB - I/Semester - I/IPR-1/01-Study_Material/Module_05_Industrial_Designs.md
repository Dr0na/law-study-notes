# 📖 Module 05: Industrial Designs

## 🎨 1. Understanding Industrial Designs

### What is an Industrial Design?

An industrial design refers to the ornamental or aesthetic aspect of an article. It's about how a product looks - its visual appearance - not how it functions. Industrial designs make products attractive and appealing to consumers, giving manufacturers a competitive edge.

**Key Concept:**

Industrial design protection is about **form**, not **function**:
- ✅ The shape of a chair that makes it aesthetically pleasing (design)
- ❌ The mechanism that makes the chair fold (patent)
- ✅ The decorative pattern on fabric (design)
- ❌ The chemical composition that makes fabric water-resistant (patent)

### Legal Definition (Section 2(d), Designs Act, 2000)

"Design" means only the features of **shape, configuration, pattern, ornamentation or composition of lines or colours** applied to any article whether in **two dimensional or three dimensional** or in both forms, by any industrial process or means, whether manual, mechanical or chemical, separate or combined, which in the finished article appeal to and are judged solely by the **eye**; but does not include any mode or principle of construction or anything which is in substance a mere **mechanical device**.

**Key Elements:**

**1. Features of Appearance:**
- Shape (3D form)
- Configuration (arrangement of parts)
- Pattern (repeating motif)
- Ornamentation (decorative elements)
- Composition of lines or colors

**2. Applied to an Article:**
Must be applied to a physical article (product).

**3. Industrial Process:**
Must be capable of being applied by industrial means (not purely artistic creation).

**4. Eye Appeal:**
The design must appeal to and be judged by the eye (visual aesthetic).

**5. Exclusions:**
- Mode or principle of construction (functional aspects)
- Mere mechanical devices (functional mechanisms)

### Meaning and Eligibility Criteria

For a design to be registrable, it must meet certain criteria:

#### **1. Novelty or Originality (Section 4)**

The design must be **new or original** - not published or disclosed anywhere in the world before the application date.

**What Destroys Novelty:**
- Prior publication in any country (in a tangible form)
- Prior public use in any country
- Prior disclosure to the public

**Grace Period:**
Limited grace period may be available for disclosure at certain exhibitions.

**Example:**
- If you create a new ornamental design for a vase and display it publicly at an exhibition without protection, novelty is destroyed.
- You should file for design registration before any public disclosure.

#### **2. Not Previously Published**

The design must not have been disclosed to the public anywhere in India or any other country by publication in tangible form before the filing date.

**"Published" includes:**
- Printed publications (magazines, catalogs, brochures)
- Display at exhibitions
- Use or sale in the market
- Online publication

#### **3. Significantly Distinguishable (Section 4(b))**

The design must be **significantly distinguishable** from known designs or combinations of known designs.

**What This Means:**
- Cannot be an obvious or trivial variation of an existing design
- Must have some degree of originality that distinguishes it from prior designs

**Example:**
- Simply changing the color of an existing design is not significantly distinguishable
- But creating a new ornamental pattern that combines elements in a unique way may be

#### **4. Not Scandalous or Obscene**

The design must not comprise or contain scandalous or obscene matter.

#### **5. Eye Appeal Only**

The registrable features must be those that appeal to and are judged by the eye - purely aesthetic, not functional.

**Functional vs. Aesthetic:**

| **Registrable (Aesthetic)** | **Not Registrable (Functional)** |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Decorative pattern on a phone case | Shape of a phone that allows better grip (functional) |
| Ornamental design on a car body | Aerodynamic shape for fuel efficiency (functional) |
| Artistic pattern on fabric | Weave structure for strength (functional) |

**Disclaimer:**
If a design has both aesthetic and functional features, the applicant must **disclaim** the functional features.

### What Cannot Be Registered

**Section 4 - Designs Not Registrable:**

A design shall not be registered if:

**1. Not New or Original**

**2. Previously Published or Used**
- Published in India or elsewhere
- Disclosed to the public before filing

**3. Not Significantly Distinguishable**
- Not sufficiently different from known designs

**4. Comprises Scandalous or Obscene Matter**

**Section 2(d) - Exclusions from Definition:**

The following are excluded from the definition of "design":

**1. Mode or Principle of Construction:**
How something is constructed or operates (functional aspect).

**2. Mechanical Devices:**
Anything that is in substance a mere mechanical device (functional mechanism).

**3. Trademarks:**
Designs that are essentially trademarks (protected under trademark law).

**4. Artistic Works:**
Purely artistic works not intended for industrial application (protected under copyright).

**Section 10 - Special Case:**

A design registered under the Designs Act cannot be subsequently registered as a trademark for the same article (and vice versa).

## 🌐 2. TRIPS Agreement on Industrial Designs (Articles 25 and 26)

TRIPS provides minimum standards for the protection of industrial designs.

### Article 25: Requirements for Protection

#### **25.1 - Protectable Subject Matter**

Members shall provide for the protection of **independently created industrial designs** that are **new or original**.

**What Can Be Protected:**
Industrial designs that are new or original.

**Flexibility:**
Members may provide that designs are not new or original if they do not significantly differ from known designs or combinations of known design features.

**Textile Designs:**
Members may provide that textile designs shall be protected if they are **new or original** within the meaning of their national law.

**Textile Exemption:**
Requirements for securing protection shall not unreasonably impair the opportunity to seek and obtain such protection.

**Important:** The designer should have a reasonable opportunity to obtain protection.

#### **25.2 - Exclusions**

Members may provide that designs:
- Are not protected if dictated essentially by **technical or functional considerations**

**Rationale:** Functional features should not be monopolized through design protection - they may be eligible for patent protection if they meet patent criteria.

**Example:**
- The shape of a Phillips screw head (functional - for use with a screwdriver) cannot be protected as a design
- But a decorative pattern on the screw head could be protected

### Article 26: Protection

#### **26.1 - Rights Conferred**

The owner of a protected industrial design shall have the right to **prevent third parties** not having the owner's consent from:
- **Making**
- **Selling**
- **Importing**

articles bearing or embodying a design which is a **copy**, or **substantially a copy**, of the protected design, when such acts are undertaken for **commercial purposes**.

**Key Points:**
- Exclusive rights to prevent copying
- Applies to commercial use
- Covers making, selling, importing

#### **26.2 - Exceptions**

Members may provide **limited exceptions** to the protection of industrial designs, provided:
- Such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with the **normal exploitation** of protected designs
- Do not unreasonably prejudice the **legitimate interests** of the owner, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties

**Similar to the Three-Step Test**

**Examples of Permitted Exceptions:**
- Use for teaching or research purposes
- Prior use rights

#### **26.3 - Term of Protection**

The duration of protection shall be at least **10 years**.

**Note:** India provides for a term of **15 years** (initially 10 years, extendable by 5 years).

## 🌍 3. Hague Agreement Concerning International Registration of Industrial Designs

### Overview

The **Hague Agreement** is an international treaty that simplifies the process of registering industrial designs in multiple countries.

**Administered by:** WIPO

**Established:** 1925 (most recent version: Geneva Act, 1999)

### Purpose

Allows applicants to obtain design protection in multiple countries through a **single international application** filed with WIPO.

### How the Hague System Works

**Step 1: International Application**

File one application with WIPO:
- Include representations of the design (drawings, photographs)
- Designate the countries where protection is sought
- Pay international fees

**Eligibility:**
Must be a national or resident of a Hague Agreement member country, or have a commercial establishment in a member country.

**Step 2: WIPO Examination**

WIPO examines for:
- Formalities (not substantive examination)
- Compliance with requirements

**Step 3: International Registration**

If in order, WIPO:
- Registers the design in the International Register
- Publishes it in the International Designs Bulletin

**Step 4: Notification to Designated Countries**

WIPO notifies the intellectual property offices of designated countries.

**Step 5: National Examination**

Each designated country examines the design according to its own laws:
- Can refuse protection if the design doesn't meet national criteria
- Must notify WIPO of any refusal within a specified time (usually 6-12 months)

**Step 6: Protection or Refusal**

- **If no refusal:** The design is protected in that country (same effect as a national registration)
- **If refusal:** The design is not protected in that country (but may still be protected in other designated countries)

### Benefits

**1. Single Application:**
File once instead of multiple applications in each country.

**2. Cost-Effective:**
Lower costs than filing separately in each country.

**3. Simplified Management:**
- Renew all registrations together
- Record changes (e.g., ownership) once, effective in all countries

**4. Multiple Designs:**
Can include up to 100 designs in one application (if they're in the same Locarno class).

**5. Deferred Publication:**
Option to defer publication up to 12 months (or longer in some cases) - useful for fashion and textile industries.

### India and the Hague Agreement

As of now, **India is not a member** of the Hague Agreement. Indian designers must file separate applications in each country where they seek protection.

**Efforts to Join:**
India has been considering acceding to the Hague Agreement to facilitate international design protection for Indian designers.

## 🇮🇳 4. The Designs Act 2000

The Designs Act, 2000, replaced the earlier Designs Act, 1911. It modernized India's design law.

### Key Features

- Aligned with international standards
- Extended protection period (15 years)
- Simplified procedures
- Clearer definitions

### Registration of Designs

#### **Who Can Apply?**

**Proprietor of the Design (Section 4(1)):**
- The author (person who created the design)
- Assignee of the author
- Legal representative
- Employer (if created during employment)

**Application Before Use:**
Design should be registered before it is published or disclosed publicly.

### Procedure of Registration

**Step 1: Filing the Application**

**Form 1 - Application for Registration**

**Details Required:**
- Applicant's name and address
- Author of the design (if different from applicant)
- Class of article (according to Locarno Classification)
- Description of the article
- Statement of novelty (what's new/original about the design)
- Representations of the design (drawings, photographs - usually 4 views: front, back, top, side)

**Where to File:**
- Patent Office (Designs Wing), Kolkata (Head Office)

**Fees:**
Prescribed fees (varies for individuals, startups, others).

**Step 2: Examination**

A **Design Examiner** examines the application for:
- Compliance with formalities
- Novelty and originality
- Whether the design is registrable (not functional, not scandalous, etc.)

**Examination Report:**

If objections, the examiner issues a report.

**Step 3: Response to Objections**

Applicant must respond within **6 months** (extendable).

**Possible Actions:**
- Arguments addressing objections
- Amendments to the application
- Submission of additional representations or evidence

**Step 4: Acceptance**

If objections are overcome, the application is **accepted**.

**Step 5: Registration**

The design is **registered** and a **Certificate of Registration** is issued.

**Publication:**
Details are published in the **Patent Office Journal**.

**Effect:**
The design is now protected. The proprietor has exclusive rights.

### Term of Designs

**Duration (Section 11):**

- **Initially:** 10 years from the date of registration
- **Extendable:** By an additional 5 years upon application and payment of fees
- **Total:** 15 years maximum

**How to Extend:**

- Apply for extension (Form 3) **before** the end of the initial 10-year period
- Pay extension fees
- Extension for another 5 years

**Non-Extendable:**
If not extended before the initial term expires, the design registration lapses and cannot be revived.

## 🔄 5. Restoration & Cancellation of Registered Registration

### Restoration (Section 12)

If a design registration lapses (e.g., due to failure to pay extension fees), it **cannot be restored** in the way patents or trademarks can.

**Once the initial 10-year term expires without extension, the design enters the public domain.**

**Best Practice:** Apply for extension well before the 10-year period ends.

### Cancellation of Registration (Section 19)

A registered design can be cancelled by the Controller on a petition by an interested person.

**Grounds for Cancellation (Section 19(1)):**

**1. Previously Registered:**
The design has been previously registered in India.

**2. Previously Published:**
The design was published in India or elsewhere prior to the date of registration.

**3. Not New or Original:**
The design is not new or original.

**4. Not Registrable:**
The design is not a "design" under the Act (e.g., it's purely functional).

**5. Not Corresponding to Section 2(d):**
The design doesn't meet the definition under Section 2(d) of the Act.

**Procedure:**

- File a petition (Form 8) with the Controller
- Pay prescribed fees
- State grounds and provide evidence
- Controller examines and may conduct a hearing
- Decision: Registration maintained, amended, or cancelled

**Effect of Cancellation:**

- The design registration is invalidated
- Treated as if it was never registered
- Design enters the public domain

### Voluntary Cancellation

The proprietor can voluntarily surrender the design registration by applying to the Controller.

## ⚖️ 6. Rights of Design Holders

### Exclusive Rights (Section 11)

The registered proprietor of a design has the **exclusive right** to:

**1. Apply the Design:**
Use the design on the article for which it's registered.

**2. Prevent Others:**
Prevent anyone else from:
- **Applying** the design to any article in the class for which it's registered
- **Importing** such articles
- **Selling, publishing, or exposing** such articles for sale

**Scope:**

Rights are limited to:
- The specific design (including designs not substantially different)
- The class of articles for which it's registered

**Example:**
If you have a registered design for an ornamental pattern on ceramic tiles (Class 23-04), you can prevent others from using that design (or substantially similar designs) on ceramic tiles. However, if someone uses a substantially different design, or uses your design on a completely different article (like fabric), it may not infringe.

### Piracy of Registered Designs (Section 22)

**What is Piracy?**

"Piracy" in the context of designs means unauthorized copying and application of a registered design.

**Piracy Occurs When:**

A person, without the authorization of the registered proprietor:
- **Applies** the registered design (or a design not substantially different) to any article in the class for which it's registered
- **Imports** such articles for sale or trade
- **Sells, publishes, or exposes** such articles for sale

**For the Purpose of Sale:**

Piracy provisions apply when the acts are done for **sale or trade** (commercial purposes).

### Remedies for Piracy (Section 22)

#### **Civil Remedies**

**1. Penalty for Piracy:**

The registered proprietor can recover from the infringer a **penalty** (by way of contract debt) of:
- **Up to ₹25,000** for each design infringed
- **Maximum of ₹50,000** in respect of any one design

**Note:** This is a statutory remedy unique to designs - it's a fixed penalty, not damages based on actual loss.

**2. Injunction:**

The proprietor can seek an injunction from the court to:
- Restrain further piracy
- Stop manufacture, import, or sale of infringing articles

**3. Delivery Up/Destruction:**

Court may order:
- Delivery up of infringing articles to the proprietor
- Destruction of infringing articles

#### **Criminal Remedies**

Unlike some other IP rights, the Designs Act does **not provide for criminal penalties** for piracy.

Remedies are purely **civil**.

#### **Defenses to Piracy**

**1. Invalidity of Registration:**

The alleged infringer can challenge the validity of the design registration (e.g., it was not new or original).

**2. No Substantial Similarity:**

The design used is substantially different from the registered design.

**3. Different Class:**

The infringing article is in a different class from the registered design.

**4. Bona Fide Independent Creation:**

The alleged infringer independently created the design without copying (though this is difficult to prove if designs are very similar).

**5. Prior Use:**

The alleged infringer was using the design before the registration date.

### Limitation Period

Actions for piracy must be brought within **3 years** from:
- The date the piracy first occurred, OR
- If the proprietor was unaware, from the date they became aware (subject to overall time limits)

### Jurisdiction

Suits for piracy are filed in:
- **District Courts** having jurisdiction
- Courts must have pecuniary jurisdiction (monetary value of the claim)
