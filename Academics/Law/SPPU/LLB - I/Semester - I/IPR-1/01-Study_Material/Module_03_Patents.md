# 📖 Module 03: Patents

## 🔬 1. Understanding Patents

### What is a Patent?

A patent is an exclusive ownership right granted by a country to the owner of an invention. Think of it as a contract between the inventor and society: the inventor discloses the invention to the public, and in return, the government grants the inventor exclusive rights to make, use, manufacture, or sell the invention for a limited period.

**Key Characteristics of Patents:**

- **Exclusivity:** The patent owner can prevent others from making, using, or selling the invention without permission
- **Territorial:** A patent granted in one country is only enforceable in that country
- **Limited Duration:** Patents last for a specific period (typically 20 years in India)
- **Public Disclosure:** The invention must be fully described in the patent application
- **Property Right:** Patents can be sold, licensed, inherited, or assigned like any other property

### The Letters Patent

When a patent is granted, the patent office issues a "Letters Patent" - a certificate that confers the exclusive right to the patent holder. This document is legal proof of the patent grant.

### 🔎 Meaning and Eligibility Criteria

For an invention to be patentable, it must satisfy three fundamental requirements:

#### **1. Novelty (Newness)**

**What is Novelty?**

An invention is considered novel if it is not part of the "state of the art" - meaning it hasn't been disclosed to the public anywhere in the world before the patent application is filed.

**State of the Art includes:**
- Published patents from any country
- Scientific and technical journals
- Books and magazines
- Conference presentations
- Public demonstrations
- Prior use anywhere in the world
- Information available on the internet

**Important Principles:**

**Global Novelty Standard:**
Novelty is assessed on a worldwide basis. Even if an invention has been published in an obscure journal in a remote country, it can destroy novelty.

**Example:** If you invent a new type of solar panel, but someone in Germany published a similar design five years ago in a technical journal, your invention lacks novelty, even if you were unaware of that publication.

**Absolute Novelty:**
Any public disclosure before filing destroys novelty. This includes:
- Publications by the inventor themselves
- Demonstrations at exhibitions
- Sales or offers for sale
- Oral presentations

**Grace Period in India:**
Indian law provides a limited grace period of 12 months for disclosures made:
- Before learned societies
- At government-approved exhibitions

However, relying on this grace period is risky. Best practice is to file the patent application *before* any public disclosure.

**What Doesn't Destroy Novelty:**
- Confidential disclosures (under non-disclosure agreements)
- Internal company discussions
- Private experiments
- Accidental disclosures in very limited circumstances

#### **2. Inventive Step (Non-Obviousness)**

**What is an Inventive Step?**

An invention involves an inventive step if it is not obvious to a "person skilled in the art" - that is, someone with ordinary skill and knowledge in the relevant technical field.

**Legal Definition (Section 2(1)(ja) of Patents Act):**
"Inventive step" means a feature of an invention that involves technical advance as compared to the existing knowledge or having economic significance or both, and that makes the invention not obvious to a person skilled in the art.

**Understanding "Obvious":**

An invention is obvious if a person skilled in the art, knowing what is already known (the prior art), would find the invention to be a natural or straightforward step.

**The Person Skilled in the Art:**
This is a hypothetical person who:
- Has ordinary skill in the relevant field (not a genius, but not a novice)
- Has access to all published information (the state of the art)
- Is technically competent but not creative
- Would not undertake inventive research

**Examples:**

**Obvious (No Inventive Step):**
- Replacing a wooden handle with a plastic handle where both materials are well-known and the replacement is straightforward
- Combining two known devices in an obvious manner without achieving a new technical effect
- Making something bigger or smaller without achieving an unexpected advantage

**Not Obvious (Involves Inventive Step):**
- Combining known elements in a new way that produces a surprising or unexpected result
- Solving a long-standing problem that others have tried and failed to solve
- Achieving a result that experts would not have predicted

**Example:** If metal knobs on cupboards are commonly corroded by moisture, replacing them with plastic knobs is obvious. However, if you discover that a specific formulation of plastic not only prevents corrosion but also has antibacterial properties that weren't previously known, this might involve an inventive step.

**Important Note:**
Inventive step is one of the most debated aspects in patent law. It involves considerable interpretation and judgment. What seems obvious in hindsight (after the invention is known) may not have been obvious beforehand.

#### **3. Industrial Applicability (Utility)**

**What is Industrial Applicability?**

An invention must be capable of being made or used in an industry - it must have practical utility.

**Legal Definition (Section 2(1)(ac) of Patents Act):**
"Capable of industrial application" means that the invention is capable of being made or used in an industry.

**What is "Industry"?**
"Industry" is interpreted broadly to include:
- Manufacturing
- Agriculture
- Fisheries
- Any other productive activity

**Key Principles:**

**Must be Operative:**
- The invention must actually work as claimed
- Purely theoretical inventions that cannot be reduced to practice are not patentable
- Perpetual motion machines, for example, are rejected as they violate natural laws

**Must be Useful:**
- The invention must provide some benefit or solve some problem
- The utility doesn't have to be groundbreaking - even minor improvements are acceptable

**Must be Reproducible:**
- The invention must be capable of being made or repeated by others
- The patent specification must provide enough detail for a person skilled in the art to reproduce the invention

**Examples:**

✅ **Industrially Applicable:**
- A new pharmaceutical compound that treats a disease
- An improved agricultural tool
- A manufacturing process that reduces waste
- A software method that improves computer performance

❌ **Not Industrially Applicable:**
- A pure mathematical formula (though applications of the formula may be patentable)
- A discovery of a natural law
- An artistic method

### 🚫 Patentable and Non-Patentable Inventions

While an invention may be novel, non-obvious, and useful, certain categories of inventions are specifically excluded from patentability.

#### **Non-Patentable Inventions (Section 3 of Patents Act, 1970)**

**1. Frivolous Inventions or Contrary to Natural Laws (Section 3(a))**

Inventions that are clearly absurd or contradict well-established natural laws.

**Examples:**
- Perpetual motion machines (violate laws of thermodynamics)
- Time travel devices
- Claims that defy physics or chemistry

**2. Inventions Contrary to Public Order or Morality (Section 3(b))**

Inventions whose primary or intended use would be illegal or immoral.

**Examples:**
- Devices specifically designed for burglary
- Methods of counterfeiting currency
- Instruments of torture

**Note:** This doesn't mean inventions that could be misused. A knife is patentable even though it could be used to harm someone, because its primary purpose is legitimate.

**3. Mere Discovery (Section 3(c))**

The mere discovery of a scientific principle, abstract theory, or living/non-living substance occurring in nature.

**Key Principle:** Discoveries are not inventions. To be patentable, you must create or invent something, not just discover what already exists.

**Examples of Non-Patentable Discoveries:**
- Discovery of a new property of a known substance
- Discovery of a naturally occurring substance (a mineral, a plant extract)
- Discovery of a new animal or plant species
- Laws of nature (e.g., E=mc²)
- Natural phenomena

**What CAN be Patented:**
- An isolated or purified form of a naturally occurring substance (if it involves an inventive step)
- A genetically modified organism (not occurring in nature)
- A process for extracting or synthesizing a natural substance

**Example:** You cannot patent a newly discovered medicinal plant, but you might be able to patent a process for extracting and purifying the active ingredient, or a pharmaceutical composition containing it.

**4. Section 3(d) - New Forms of Known Substances**

This is one of the most important and controversial provisions, particularly for pharmaceuticals.

**What It Says:**
The mere discovery of a new form of a known substance that does not result in the enhancement of the known efficacy of that substance is not patentable.

**Purpose:** To prevent "evergreening" - the practice of obtaining multiple patents on minor variations of the same drug to extend market exclusivity.

**What is Included (Explanation):**
Salts, esters, ethers, polymorphs, metabolites, pure forms, particle size, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes, combinations, and other derivatives of a known substance are considered the same substance unless they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy.

**"Efficacy" Means:**
Therapeutic efficacy - the ability to produce the desired therapeutic effect.

**Examples:**

❌ **Not Patentable under Section 3(d):**
- A new crystalline form of a known drug with no improved therapeutic effect (even if it has better stability or solubility)
- A salt form of a known drug with no enhanced efficacy
- A sustained-release formulation without enhanced efficacy

✅ **May be Patentable:**
- A new form with significantly enhanced therapeutic efficacy
- A new form that reduces side effects substantially
- A new combination that produces a synergistic therapeutic effect

**Landmark Case: Novartis v. Union of India (2013)**

In this famous case, the Supreme Court of India rejected Novartis's patent application for the beta crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate (used in cancer treatment, branded as Gleevec).

**Held:** The beta crystalline form did not have enhanced therapeutic efficacy compared to the known free form. Though it had better bioavailability (absorption into the body), this did not amount to enhanced therapeutic efficacy. The application was rejected under Section 3(d).

**Significance:** This case clarified that minor improvements in properties like bioavailability are insufficient if therapeutic efficacy is not enhanced.

**5. Mixture or Mere Admixture (Section 3(e))**

A substance obtained by mere admixture resulting only in the aggregation of the properties of the components.

**What This Means:**
If you simply mix two known substances and get a product that just combines their known properties (without any synergistic effect), it's not patentable.

**Example:**

❌ **Not Patentable:**
Mixing two known painkilling drugs where the result is just the sum of their individual effects.

✅ **Patentable:**
Mixing two substances that produce a surprising synergistic effect - where the combination is more effective than the simple sum of the individual effects.

**6. Known Process, Machine, or Apparatus (Section 3(f))**

The mere arrangement or rearrangement or duplication of known devices, each functioning independently in a known way, is not patentable.

**Example:**

❌ **Not Patentable:**
Simply placing two known machines side by side where each continues to function independently.

✅ **Patentable:**
Combining known components in a new way such that they interact to produce a new and unexpected result.

**7. Methods of Agriculture or Horticulture (Section 3(h))**

Traditional agricultural or horticultural methods are not patentable.

**Rationale:** To protect farmers and ensure agricultural knowledge remains in the public domain.

**What's Not Patentable:**
- Methods of cultivation
- Methods of irrigation
- Methods of harvesting

**What May Be Patentable:**
- Agricultural machinery
- Genetically modified organisms (subject to other restrictions)
- Agrochemicals

**8. Medical, Surgical, Curative, or Diagnostic Methods (Section 3(i))**

Methods of treatment of humans or animals are not patentable.

**What's Not Patentable:**
- Surgical procedures
- Therapeutic methods (ways of treating diseases)
- Diagnostic methods (ways of diagnosing diseases)
- Prophylactic methods (preventive treatments)

**Rationale:** Ensuring that healthcare professionals can freely use any treatment method without fear of patent infringement.

**What IS Patentable:**
- Pharmaceutical products (drugs)
- Medical devices
- Diagnostic kits and apparatus
- Surgical instruments

**Example:**
❌ Not patentable: A method of performing heart surgery
✅ Patentable: A surgical instrument used in heart surgery
❌ Not patentable: A method of diagnosing diabetes by measuring blood sugar
✅ Patentable: A blood glucose monitoring device

**9. Plants, Animals, and Biological Processes (Section 3(j))**

**Not Patentable:**
- Plants and animals in whole or in part
- Seeds, varieties, and species
- Essentially biological processes for production or propagation of plants and animals

**Exceptions (What IS Patentable):**
- **Microorganisms** (bacteria, viruses, fungi, algae, protozoa)
- **Microbiological processes** (processes involving microorganisms or producing microorganisms)
- **Genetically modified microorganisms** (not occurring in nature)

**Note:** India has a separate law - the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001 - for protecting new plant varieties.

**10. Mathematical or Business Methods, Computer Programs, and Algorithms (Section 3(k))**

**Not Patentable Per Se:**
- Mathematical methods or formulas
- Business methods
- Computer programs per se
- Algorithms

**What "Per Se" Means:**
Pure algorithms, business methods, or software in abstract form are not patentable. However, if they are part of a technical solution to a technical problem and have industrial application, they may be patentable.

**Examples:**

❌ **Not Patentable:**
- A mathematical formula for calculating interest rates
- A business method for selling products online
- Source code of a computer program by itself

✅ **May Be Patentable:**
- A computer-implemented invention that solves a technical problem (e.g., image processing, data compression)
- Software combined with hardware to achieve a technical effect
- A method of controlling an industrial process using software

**Note:** This area is evolving, and many countries (including India) are still developing clear guidelines on software patents.

**11. Literary, Artistic, or Aesthetic Creations (Section 3(l))**

These are protected by copyright, not patents.

**Examples:**
- Books, poems, plays (copyright)
- Musical compositions (copyright)
- Paintings, sculptures (copyright)
- Cinematographic works (copyright)

**12. Mental Acts or Games (Section 3(m))**

Pure mental processes or methods of playing games are not patentable.

**Examples:**
❌ Not patentable: A method of solving a puzzle mentally
❌ Not patentable: Rules of a new card game

✅ Patentable: Apparatus for playing a game (e.g., a specially designed gaming device)

**13. Presentation of Information (Section 3(n))**

Merely presenting information in a new way is not patentable.

**Example:**
❌ Not patentable: A new format for displaying data on a computer screen (if it's just a presentation of information without a technical contribution)

✅ Patentable: A method of compressing data that improves computer performance (technical contribution beyond just presentation)

**14. Topography of Integrated Circuits (Section 3(o))**

These are protected under a separate law: the Semiconductor Integrated Circuits Layout-Design Act, 2000.

**15. Traditional Knowledge (Section 3(p))**

An invention that is traditional knowledge or an aggregation or duplication of known properties of traditionally known components is not patentable.

**Rationale:** To protect India's traditional knowledge (like Ayurvedic formulations) from being patented by others.

**Examples:**
❌ Not patentable: Traditional use of turmeric for wound healing (already known in Ayurveda)

✅ Patentable: A novel pharmaceutical formulation derived from turmeric with enhanced efficacy and involving an inventive step

**16. Inventions Relating to Atomic Energy (Section 4)**

As per the Atomic Energy Act, 1962, inventions related to atomic energy are not patentable.

## 🌐 2. TRIPS Agreement on Patents (Articles 27-34)

The TRIPS Agreement sets minimum standards for patent protection that all WTO members must provide. These provisions represent a significant harmonization of patent law globally.

### Article 27: Patentable Subject Matter

#### **27.1 - General Availability of Patents**

**Key Requirements:**

**1. Patents Available for All Fields of Technology**
- Member countries must make patents available for inventions in all fields of technology
- Cannot discriminate based on the field of invention
- Cannot exclude specific industries from patent protection

**Before TRIPS:**
Many developing countries, including India, did not grant product patents for pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals - only process patents were available.

**After TRIPS:**
India had to amend its Patents Act to allow product patents for pharmaceuticals (implemented in 2005).

**2. Non-Discrimination**
- Patents must be available and patent rights enjoyable without discrimination as to:
  - Place of invention
  - Field of technology
  - Whether products are imported or locally produced

**Example:** A pharmaceutical product invented in the United States must be eligible for the same patent protection in India as a pharmaceutical product invented in India.

**3. Patentability Criteria**
Patents shall be available for inventions that are:
- **New (novel)**
- **Involve an inventive step (non-obvious)**
- **Capable of industrial application (useful)**

#### **27.2 - Exceptions to Patentability**

Members may exclude from patentability:

**Ordre Public or Morality:**
- Inventions whose prevention within their territory is necessary to protect ordre public or morality
- This includes protecting human, animal, or plant life or health
- Or to avoid serious prejudice to the environment

**Condition:** The exclusion must not be made merely because the exploitation is prohibited by domestic law.

**Example:** A country can refuse to patent a human cloning process on morality grounds.

**27.3 - Specific Exclusions Permitted**

Members may also exclude from patentability:

**1. Diagnostic, Therapeutic, and Surgical Methods:**
- Methods for treatment of humans or animals
- Diagnostic methods

**2. Plants and Animals (except microorganisms):**
- Plants and animals other than microorganisms

**3. Essentially Biological Processes:**
- Biological processes for the production of plants or animals
- Exception: Microbiological processes and their products must be patentable

**Plant Varieties:**
Members must provide protection for plant varieties either:
- By patents, OR
- By an effective sui generis system (a special system), OR
- By a combination of both

**Note:** India chose the sui generis route - the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001.

### Article 28: Rights Conferred

#### **Patent Owner's Rights**

**For Product Patents (Article 28.1(a)):**
The patent owner has the exclusive right to prevent third parties not having the owner's consent from:
- **Making** the product
- **Using** the product
- **Offering for sale** the product
- **Selling** the product
- **Importing** the product

**For Process Patents (Article 28.1(b)):**
The patent owner has the exclusive right to prevent third parties not having the owner's consent from:
- **Using** the process
- Using, offering for sale, selling, or importing **products obtained directly by that process**

**Example:** If you have a patented process for manufacturing a chemical, you can prevent others from using your process. You can also prevent them from selling or importing products made by your process.

#### **Rights and Obligations of Patent Owners**

Patent owners also have rights to:
- **Assign** the patent (transfer ownership)
- **License** the patent (grant permission to use)
- **Conclude licensing contracts**

### Article 29: Conditions on Patent Applicants

#### **29.1 - Disclosure Requirement**

Applicants must disclose the invention in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art.

**Purpose:** The quid pro quo of the patent system - inventors get exclusive rights in exchange for disclosing their invention to the public.

**29.2 - Best Mode**

Members may require the applicant to indicate the best mode for carrying out the invention known to the inventor at the filing date.

**Note:** This requirement has been debated. Some countries (like the U.S.) had a "best mode" requirement; others don't strictly enforce it.

#### **29.3 - Traditional Knowledge Disclosure**

Inserted after extensive debate, this provision suggests members may require applicants to disclose:
- The source of biological material used in the invention
- The country of origin of such material
- Evidence of benefit-sharing agreements

**India's Implementation:**
India requires disclosure of the source and geographical origin of biological material used in the invention (Sections 10(4)(d)(ii) and 25(1)(k) of the Patents Act).

### Article 30: Exceptions to Rights Conferred

Members may provide **limited exceptions** to the exclusive rights conferred by a patent, provided that such exceptions:

**Three-Step Test:**

**1. Do not unreasonably conflict with normal exploitation of the patent**
- Must not interfere with the patent owner's ability to commercially exploit the patent
- Minor uses that don't affect the market are acceptable

**2. Do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the patent owner**
- Must not unfairly harm the patent owner
- Balance between owner's interests and public interests

**3. Take account of the legitimate interests of third parties**
- Others may have legitimate reasons to use the patented invention
- Public interest considerations

**Examples of Permitted Exceptions:**

**Research Exception:**
Using patented inventions for research and experimentation (not commercial purposes).

**Example:** A scientist may use a patented compound in their laboratory research without infringing the patent, as long as the research is non-commercial.

**Regulatory Review Exception (Bolar Provision):**
Using a patented invention to obtain regulatory approval for generic drugs before the patent expires.

**Example:** A generic drug company can test and prepare their version of a patented drug before the patent expires, so they can immediately launch the generic version once the patent expires.

**Prior User Rights:**
If someone was using the invention before the patent was filed, they may be allowed to continue using it.

**Experimental Use:**
Limited use for experimental or teaching purposes.

### Article 31: Other Use Without Authorization of the Right Holder (Compulsory Licenses)

This is one of the most important and controversial provisions of TRIPS. It addresses when a government can authorize someone other than the patent owner to use the patented invention without the owner's consent (compulsory licensing).

#### **Conditions for Compulsory Licenses:**

**1. Individual Merits (Article 31(a))**
- Each request must be considered on its individual merits
- Cannot have blanket compulsory licenses

**2. Prior Negotiation (Article 31(b))**
- The person seeking the license must have first attempted to obtain a voluntary license from the patent owner on reasonable commercial terms
- This requirement may be waived in:
  - National emergency
  - Other circumstances of extreme urgency
  - Public non-commercial use

**Example:** During a disease outbreak, a government may grant a compulsory license without prior negotiation with the patent owner.

**3. Scope and Duration (Article 31(c))**
- The license must be limited in scope and duration
- Must be limited to the purpose for which it was authorized
- For semiconductor technology, only for public non-commercial use or to remedy anti-competitive practices

**4. Non-Exclusive (Article 31(d))**
- Compulsory licenses must be non-exclusive
- Cannot grant an exclusive license to a third party

**5. Non-Assignable (Article 31(e))**
- Can only be assigned with the part of the enterprise that enjoys the use
- Cannot independently sell or transfer the license

**6. Predominantly Domestic Market (Article 31(f))**
- Use must be predominantly for the supply of the domestic market
- Cannot primarily be for export

**Important:** This was a major issue for countries without manufacturing capacity. The Doha Declaration and subsequent TRIPS amendment addressed this (discussed below).

**7. Termination (Article 31(g))**
- The license must be liable to be terminated if circumstances that led to it cease to exist
- Must be subject to review

**8. Adequate Remuneration (Article 31(h))**
- The patent owner must be paid adequate remuneration
- Must take into account the economic value of the authorization

**9. Legal Review (Article 31(i), (j))**
- Decisions must be subject to judicial or independent review
- Any decision on remuneration must also be subject to review

**10. Special Case: Anti-Competitive Practices (Article 31(k))**
- When a compulsory license is granted to remedy anti-competitive practices, the conditions regarding:
  - Prior negotiation
  - Predominantly domestic market
  - Adequate remuneration
...may be waived or modified.

#### **Compulsory Licenses and Access to Medicines**

The issue of compulsory licenses became critical during the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa. Patented antiretroviral drugs were unaffordable in many developing countries.

**The Problem:**
Article 31(f) required that compulsory licenses be "predominantly for the supply of the domestic market." This meant:
- Countries without manufacturing capacity couldn't import generic versions under compulsory licenses
- Countries with manufacturing capacity couldn't export under compulsory licenses

**The Solution:**

**Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health (2001):**
- Affirmed that TRIPS should be interpreted to support public health
- Clarified rights to use compulsory licenses
- Committed to finding a solution for countries with insufficient manufacturing capacity

**TRIPS Amendment (2005/2017):**
- Added Article 31bis
- Allows exporting countries to issue compulsory licenses for export to importing countries that have insufficient manufacturing capacity
- Simplified procedure compared to Article 31(f)
- Became formally part of TRIPS in 2017

### Article 32: Revocation/Forfeiture

If a patent is revoked or forfeited:
- There must be an opportunity for judicial review
- Revocation cannot be based solely on the failure to work the patent (not using or not manufacturing locally), unless compulsory licensing has proven insufficient

### Article 33: Term of Protection

**Minimum Patent Term:**
- At least 20 years from the filing date

**What This Means:**
- All WTO members must provide patent protection for at least 20 years
- Countries can provide longer terms if they choose
- The term is counted from the date of filing the application, not from the date of grant

**Before TRIPS:**
Patent terms varied significantly - some countries had 15-year or 17-year terms.

**Note:** In some countries, patent term extensions are available in certain circumstances (e.g., for pharmaceutical products to compensate for time spent in regulatory approval).

### Article 34: Process Patents - Burden of Proof

When a patent is for a process for obtaining a product:
- If the product is new, there is a rebuttable presumption that the product was obtained by the patented process
- This shifts the burden of proof to the alleged infringer to prove they didn't use the patented process

**Why This Matters:**
Proving process infringement is difficult - you often can't see how a competitor manufactures their product. If the product is new, the burden shifts to them to prove they used a different process.

**Conditions:**
- The product must be new (never existed before the patent)
- The burden shift is rebuttable - the alleged infringer can provide evidence they used a different process

**Safeguards:**
- The legitimate interests of defendants must be protected
- Trade secrets and confidential information must be respected

## 📋 3. International Patent Applications

### Convention Application (Paris Convention)

Under the Paris Convention, an inventor can file a patent application in one member country and then file in other member countries within 12 months, claiming "priority" from the first filing date.

**How It Works:**

**Step 1:** File a patent application in your home country (e.g., India) on January 1, 2024.

**Step 2:** Within 12 months (by January 1, 2025), file patent applications in other Paris Convention member countries (e.g., USA, UK, Japan).

**Step 3:** The applications filed in other countries will be treated as if they were filed on January 1, 2024 (your priority date).

**Benefits:**
- Secures priority date across multiple countries
- Provides time to assess commercial potential
- Allows translation and preparation of applications for different countries
- Any publications or patent applications by others between your first filing and subsequent filings won't be used against you

### PCT International Application (Patent Cooperation Treaty)

The PCT system, administered by WIPO, simplifies the process of seeking patent protection in multiple countries.

#### **Background**

Filing separate patent applications in many countries is:
- Expensive (filing fees, attorney fees, translation costs)
- Time-consuming
- Complex (different procedures in each country)

The PCT provides a unified procedure for filing patent applications internationally.

#### **Key Features of PCT**

**1. Single Application:**
File one "international application" that has effect in all PCT member countries (over 150 countries).

**2. International Search:**
An International Searching Authority (ISA) conducts a search and provides a search report indicating relevant prior art.

**3. International Publication:**
The application is published internationally, typically 18 months after the priority date.

**4. Optional International Preliminary Examination:**
Applicant can request preliminary examination for an opinion on patentability.

**5. National/Regional Phase:**
Applicant then decides in which countries to proceed with the application and enters the "national phase" in those countries.

#### **PCT Procedure - Step by Step**

**Phase 1: International Phase**

**Step 1: Filing (Month 0)**
- File PCT application with a receiving office (RO)
  - Can file in your national patent office (e.g., Indian Patent Office)
  - Or directly with WIPO
- Designate countries (now, all PCT members are automatically designated)

**Step 2: International Search (Months 3-4)**
- ISA conducts a search of prior art
- ISA issues International Search Report (ISR) and Written Opinion
- These indicate whether the invention appears novel and non-obvious

**Step 3: International Publication (Month 18)**
- Application published by WIPO
- Becomes part of the state of the art

**Step 4: Optional International Preliminary Examination (Months 22-28)**
- Applicant can request examination by an International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA)
- IPEA issues International Preliminary Examination Report (IPER)
- Provides a more detailed opinion on patentability

**Phase 2: National/Regional Phase**

**Step 5: National Phase Entry (Months 30-31)**
- Applicant decides in which countries to seek patents
- Files necessary translations
- Pays national fees
- Enters "national phase" in selected countries

**Step 6: National Examination and Grant**
- Each national/regional office examines the application according to its own laws
- May grant or refuse the patent
- If granted, issues a national patent

#### **Benefits of PCT**

**1. Delayed Decision:**
Applicant has 30-31 months (instead of 12 under Paris Convention) to decide which countries to enter.

**Why This Matters:**
- More time to assess commercial potential
- More time to secure funding
- More time to translate applications

**2. Early Search Report:**
- ISR provides insight into patentability
- Helps decide whether to proceed
- Can use the report to amend claims

**3. Cost Savings:**
- Initial costs are lower than filing separately in each country
- Can delay major expenses (translations, national fees) until national phase
- If search report is negative, can abandon without incurring all national costs

**4. Centralized Process:**
- Single application initially
- Uniform procedure for international phase
- Simplified filing process

**5. Flexibility:**
- Can amend application after seeing search report
- Can narrow or broaden claims
- Can drop countries where prospects are poor

#### **PCT in India**

**India as Receiving Office:**
Indian Patent Office (New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai) can receive PCT applications.

**India as ISA/IPEA:**
Indian Patent Office functions as an ISA and IPEA for Indian residents.

**Filing PCT Applications:**
Indian residents can file PCT applications:
- At the Indian Patent Office
- Directly with WIPO

**Note:** Indian residents must obtain permission (or wait 6 weeks) before filing abroad if the invention was made in India.

#### **Costs**

PCT filing involves several fees:
- **Transmittal fee** (to the receiving office)
- **International filing fee** (to WIPO)
- **Search fee** (to ISA)
- **Optional examination fee** (to IPEA)
- **National phase fees** (when entering national phase)
- **Translation costs**

**Fee Reductions:**
Applicants from countries where per capita GDP is below a threshold receive 90% fee reduction for international filing and search fees.

### Budapest Treaty (Deposit of Microorganisms)

#### **The Problem**

For inventions involving microorganisms:
- A written description may be insufficient to enable reproduction
- Microorganisms cannot always be adequately described in words
- Some microorganisms are unique strains not publicly available

#### **The Solution: Budapest Treaty**

The Budapest Treaty provides an international system for depositing microorganisms for patent purposes.

**How It Works:**

**1. Deposit:**
Inventor deposits a sample of the microorganism with an International Depositary Authority (IDA).

**2. Recognition:**
All Budapest Treaty member countries recognize the deposit as valid for patent purposes.

**3. Single Deposit:**
One deposit satisfies the deposit requirements for all member countries - no need to deposit in each country separately.

**International Depositary Authorities (IDAs):**
These are institutions (culture collections) recognized to hold deposits under the Budapest Treaty.

**In India:**
- **Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH), Chandigarh** is an IDA
- Microorganisms can be deposited here for patent applications

**Patent Specification Requirements:**

## 🇮🇳 4. The Patents Act, 1970

The Patents Act, 1970, is the principal legislation governing patents in India. It has been significantly amended (1999, 2002, 2005) to comply with TRIPS.

### 📋 Procedure for Grant of a Patent

The patent application and grant process in India involves several stages. Understanding this process is essential for anyone seeking patent protection.

#### **Step 1: Patent Search (Recommended but not Mandatory)**

Before filing, conduct searches to:
- Assess novelty and patentability
- Identify prior art
- Review competitor patents
- Refine the invention and claims

**Where to Search:**
- Indian Patent Office database (ipindia.gov.in)
- WIPO PATENTSCOPE
- Google Patents
- Espacenet (European Patent Office)

#### **Step 2: Preparation of Patent Application**

**Key Documents:**

**1. Form 1 - Application for Grant of Patent:**
- Applicant's details
- Inventor's details
- Title of invention
- Declaration of inventorship
- Priority claims (if any)

**2. Form 2 - Provisional or Complete Specification:**

**Provisional Specification:**
- Filed when the invention is not fully developed
- Establishes priority date
- Describes the essence of the invention
- Less detailed than complete specification
- Must be followed by complete specification within 12 months (non-extendable)

**Complete Specification:**
- Fully describes the invention
- Includes claims defining the scope of protection
- May be filed directly (without provisional) or within 12 months of provisional
- Required for patent grant

**Contents of Complete Specification:**
- **Title:** Brief title of the invention
- **Field of Invention:** Technical field to which the invention belongs
- **Background:** Prior art and its drawbacks
- **Summary:** Brief summary of the invention
- **Detailed Description:** Complete description enabling a person skilled in the art to reproduce the invention
- **Drawings:** (if necessary) Illustrations of the invention
- **Claims:** Legal statements defining the scope of protection sought
- **Abstract:** Brief summary (not exceeding 150 words)

**Claims - The Most Important Part:**

Claims define the boundaries of patent protection. They determine:
- What is protected by the patent
- What would constitute infringement
- The commercial value of the patent

**Types of Claims:**
- **Independent claims:** Stand-alone claims defining the invention
- **Dependent claims:** Refer to and further limit independent claims

**3. Form 3 - Statement and Undertaking Regarding Foreign Applications:**
- Disclose if applications for the same or substantially the same invention have been filed abroad
- Undertake to inform the Patent Office if such applications are filed in the future

**4. Form 5 - Declaration as to Inventorship:**
- Names all inventors

**5. Form 8 (optional) - Request to Mention Inventors:**
- If you want inventors' names to appear on the patent

**6. Form 26 (if applicable) - Power of Attorney:**
- If filing through a patent agent

#### **Step 3: Filing the Application**

**Where to File:**
- Any of the four Patent Office branches: New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, or Chennai
- Jurisdiction depends on where the applicant resides or has principal place of business
- Can file physically or online (e-filing available)

**Fees:**
- Different fee scales for:
  - **Natural persons** (individuals)
  - **Startup/small entities**
  - **Other than small entities** (large corporations)
- Fee depends on number of pages and claims

**Filing Date:**

The date on which Form 1 and either a provisional or complete specification are filed becomes the **filing date** - the priority date for the patent.

**What Happens After Filing:**

- Application is given a number
- Acknowledgment issued
- Application enters the patent examination pipeline

#### **Step 4: Publication (18 months from filing/priority date)**

**Automatic Publication:**
Applications are automatically published 18 months from:
- Filing date (for national applications), OR
- Priority date (for convention or PCT applications)

**Early Publication (Optional):**
Applicant can request early publication by filing **Form 9** with fees.

**Why Request Early Publication?**
- Speeds up the examination process
- Puts competitors on notice
- Establishes public record sooner

**What is Published?**
- Application details
- Abstract
- Claims
- Drawings
- Applicant and inventor information

**Publication in Official Journal:**
Details published in the Patent Office Journal and on the website.

**Effect of Publication:**
- Application becomes part of the state of the art (prior art for later applications)
- Can be cited against other applications
- Public can inspect the complete application

#### **Step 5: Request for Examination**

**Critical Step:**

Filing an application does NOT automatically mean it will be examined. You must file a **Request for Examination (Form 18)** with fees.

**Timeline:**
- Must be filed within **48 months** from filing date or priority date (whichever is earlier)
- Can be filed at the time of filing the application or later
- Can be filed by the applicant or any interested third party

**Why the Request System?**

- Many applications are abandoned or withdrawn
- Avoids unnecessary examination burden on the Patent Office
- Allows applicants time to assess commercial viability before paying examination fees

**What Happens if You Don't File?**

If no request for examination is filed within 48 months:
- The application is deemed **withdrawn**
- No patent will be granted
- No refund of fees
- Cannot be revived

**Important:** Don't miss this deadline!

#### **Step 6: Examination**

Once the request for examination is filed, the application is assigned to a **Patent Examiner** who:
- Searches for prior art
- Examines the application for compliance with the Patents Act
- Checks for patentability (novelty, inventive step, industrial applicability)
- Checks for compliance with formal requirements

**First Examination Report (FER):**

The examiner issues a **First Examination Report** (also called Office Action or Examination Report) stating:
- Objections, if any
- Grounds for objection
- Citations of prior art that affect patentability
- Formal defects

**Common Objections:**
- Lack of novelty
- Lack of inventive step
- Not patentable subject matter (falls under Section 3)
- Insufficient disclosure
- Claims too broad
- Non-compliance with formal requirements

#### **Step 7: Response to FER**

**Timeline:**
Applicant has **12 months** from the date of FER to respond (this is extended to 18 months for international applications).

**This 12-month period is non-extendable.** If no response is filed:
- Application is deemed abandoned
- No patent granted
- Cannot be revived

**What to Do:**

**1. Review the FER carefully:**
- Understand each objection
- Review cited prior art
- Consult with patent attorney/agent

**2. Prepare Response:**
May include:
- **Arguments:** Explaining why objections are not valid
- **Amendments:** Modifying the specification or claims to overcome objections
- **Evidence:** Affidavits, test reports, expert opinions (if necessary)
- **Comparison with Prior Art:** Showing points of distinction

**3. File Response:**
- Written submissions (Form 13)
- Amended specifications (Form 13A, if amending)
- Request for hearing (optional, if needed)

**Amendments:**
- Can amend the specification and claims
- Amendments must not introduce new matter (not disclosed in the original application)
- Cannot broaden the scope beyond what was originally claimed

**Hearing:**

Applicant can request an oral hearing to present arguments before the Controller.

**Further Examination:**

After receiving the response:
- Examiner may accept the response and recommend grant
- Or, examiner may issue further objections or require clarification
- Continued communication until objections are resolved or applicant gives up

#### **Step 8: Grant or Refusal**

**If Objections are Overcome:**

The **Controller of Patents** issues an order for **grant of patent**:
- Applicant is notified
- Must pay grant fees within specified time
- Patent is sealed and granted
- **Certificate of Patent** is issued (Form 24)

**Publication of Grant:**
- Details published in the Patent Office Journal
- Patent number issued

**If Objections are Not Overcome:**

The application is **refused**:
- Order of refusal issued with reasons
- Applicant can appeal to the Appellate Board

#### **Step 9: Post-Grant**

**Maintenance (Renewal) Fees:**

To keep the patent in force, annual maintenance fees must be paid:
- Starting from the 2nd year after filing
- Due on each anniversary of filing
- Different fee scales for different years (increases over time)
- Grace period of 6 months with penalty fees

**Failure to Pay:**
- Patent lapses
- Invention enters public domain
- Can be restored within 18 months if there was a genuine oversight

**Working of Patent:**

Patent owners must file statements on the commercial working of the patent in India:
- Form 27 - must be filed annually if the patent is commercialized
- Failure to provide information can be a ground for compulsory license

### ⚖️ Pre-Grant and Post-Grant Opposition

The Indian Patents Act provides two opportunities for third parties to oppose the grant of a patent:

#### **Pre-Grant Opposition (Section 25(1))**

**When:** After publication of the application but **before** the patent is granted.

**Who Can File:** **Any person** (the law says "any person" - not just interested parties).

**How to File:**
- Written representation (Form 7A) to the Controller
- With evidence supporting the grounds of opposition

**Grounds for Pre-Grant Opposition:**

Can oppose on any of the following grounds (same as post-grant):
- Wrongfully obtained from the opponent or from the true inventor
- Already published or publicly known/used in India before the priority date
- Already claimed in another patent with earlier priority
- Obvious or does not involve an inventive step
- Not an invention or not patentable under the Act
- Insufficient or unclear description
- Failure to disclose information or furnishing false information regarding foreign applications
- Not filed within 12 months from the convention country (for convention applications)
- Failure to disclose or incorrect mention of source/geographical origin of biological material
- Anticipated by traditional knowledge

**Procedure:**

- Opposition filed with the Patent Office
- Applicant is given opportunity to respond
- May include hearing
- Controller considers the opposition while deciding whether to grant the patent

**Advantage of Pre-Grant Opposition:**

- Can prevent grant of an invalid patent
- Cheaper and faster than post-grant opposition or revocation
- Anonymous (opponent's name not disclosed until hearing)

#### **Post-Grant Opposition (Section 25(2))**

**When:** Within **12 months** from the date of publication of grant of the patent.

**Who Can File:** **Any interested person** (more restricted than pre-grant).

**"Interested Person" includes:**
- A person engaged in or promoting research in the same field
- A person engaged in the manufacture of similar products
- A person affected by the grant of the patent

**How to File:**
- Representation (Form 7) to the Controller
- With evidence

**Grounds for Post-Grant Opposition:**

Same as pre-grant opposition:
- Wrongful obtaining
- Lack of novelty
- Lack of inventive step
- Not patentable
- Insufficient disclosure
- Misrepresentation or suppression of facts

**Procedure:**

- Opposition filed with the Patent Office
- Patentee is notified and given opportunity to respond
- **Opposition Board** constituted (Section 25(3)):
  - The Board considers the opposition
  - May conduct hearings
  - Examines evidence
- Controller makes decision based on Board's recommendation
- Can uphold or revoke the patent

**Decision:**
- Patent can be:
  - Maintained (opposition rejected)
  - Amended (if issues can be resolved by amending claims)
  - Revoked (opposition upheld)

**Appeal:**
Either party can appeal the Controller's decision to the **Appellate Board** (Intellectual Property Appellate Board - IPAB, though as of recent developments, appeals go to High Courts).

### ⏱️ Term of Patent

**Duration:**
- **20 years** from the date of filing of the application (Section 53)

**Important Notes:**

- Term is calculated from the **filing date**, not the grant date
- This applies to all fields of technology
- No extensions available (except in very limited circumstances, e.g., delays caused by war)

**Example:**
If you file a patent application on January 1, 2024, and the patent is granted on June 1, 2026, it will expire on December 31, 2043 (20 years from January 1, 2024).

**Maintenance:**
To keep the patent in force for the full 20 years, you must:
- Pay annual renewal fees
- File working statements (if applicable)

### 🔄 Patent of Addition (Section 54)

**What is a Patent of Addition?**

A Patent of Addition is a patent for an improvement or modification of an existing invention for which a patent has already been granted or applied for.

**Purpose:**
Encourages incremental innovation by providing protection for improvements without requiring full patent criteria.

**Features:**

**1. Must be Applied for in Relation to a Main Patent:**
- There must be a "main" patent or application
- The addition must be an improvement or modification of the subject matter of the main patent

**2. Not Required to Involve Inventive Step:**
- Unlike regular patents, a patent of addition doesn't require an inventive step over the main patent
- Only needs to be novel

**3. Term:**
- Patent of addition expires with the main patent
- Cannot extend beyond the term of the main patent

**4. No Renewal Fees:**
- No separate renewal fees for patents of addition

**5. Can be Converted:**
If the main patent is revoked or expires, the patent of addition can be converted to an independent patent (if it meets patentability criteria).

**Example:**

You have a patent for a new pharmaceutical composition. Later, you discover that adding a specific coating makes it more effective. You can file for a patent of addition for the coated version, which will expire when your main patent expires.

- Geographical origin

**Failure to Disclose:**
- Can be a ground for revoking the patent
- Can be a ground for opposition

**2. Duty to Work the Patent in India (Sections 83, 84, 85)**

**Policy Considerations:**

- Patents are granted to encourage innovation and make inventions available to the public
- If a patentee doesn't work (manufacture) the invention in India or makes it available only at prohibitively high prices, the purpose of the patent is defeated

**Working Requirements:**

While not an absolute obligation to manufacture in India, the Patents Act has provisions promoting working:

**Section 83 - General Principles:**
- Patents are not granted merely to enable patentees to enjoy monopoly for importation
- Patents should be worked in India on a commercial scale
- Reasonable requirements of the public should be satisfied

**Section 84 - Compulsory License for Non-Working:**

If:
- 3 years have passed since grant, AND
- The invention is not worked in India, OR
- The reasonable requirements of the public are not satisfied, OR
- The invention is not available at a reasonably affordable price

Then, any interested person can apply for a compulsory license.

**Section 85 - Revocation for Non-Working:**

If 2 years have passed since the grant of the first compulsory license, and:
- The patentee still hasn't worked the invention in India sufficiently, AND
- Circumstances justifying a compulsory license continue

Then, the Central Government or any interested person can apply for revocation of the patent.

**Working Statements (Section 146(2), Rule 131):**

Every patentee must file a statement regarding the commercial working of the patent in India:
- **Form 27** - must be filed annually
- Due every year on or before March 31
- Must state whether the patent has been worked commercially in India
- If worked, provide details of extent and manner of working

**Failure to File:**
- Punishable with fine
- Can be a ground for compulsory license

**3. Duty to Pay Renewal Fees**

To keep the patent in force:
- Annual renewal fees must be paid starting from the 2nd year
- Due on the anniversary of the filing date
- Failure to pay results in lapse of the patent

**4. Duty Not to Abuse Patent Rights**

**Anti-Competitive Practices:**

Patentees must not:
- Impose conditions in licenses that are anti-competitive
- Refuse to grant licenses when it results in:
  - Trade or industry prejudice
  - Unfair trade practices
  - International technology transfer impediments

**Remedies:**
- Competition Commission of India can investigate
- Compulsory licenses can be granted (Section 84(7))

**5. Duty to Respond to Patent Office**

During examination or post-grant proceedings:
- Must respond to objections within prescribed time limits
- Must provide requested information
- Failure can result in abandonment or revocation

### Revocation of Patent (Section 64)

A patent can be revoked by the Appellate Board (or now, High Courts) on various grounds:

**Grounds for Revocation:**

1. **Wrongful Obtaining:** Patent obtained wrongfully or from the person not entitled
2. **Lack of Novelty/Inventive Step:** Not novel or obvious
3. **Not Patentable:** Falls under non-patentable subject matter (Section 3/4)
4. **Insufficient Disclosure:** Does not fully describe the invention
5. **False Suggestion/Suppression:** Patentee fraudulently or incorrectly claimed invention or suppressed material information
6. **Non-Disclosure of Foreign Applications:** Failed to provide information about foreign applications
7. **Biological Material Disclosure:** Failed to disclose source/geographical origin
8. **Traditional Knowledge:** Anticipated by traditional knowledge

**Who Can Seek Revocation:**
- Central Government
- Any interested person
- Can be sought via post-grant opposition or separate revocation petition

**Effect of Revocation:**
- Patent is cancelled
- Treated as if it never existed
- Invention enters public domain

### Surrender of Patent (Section 63)

A patentee can voluntarily surrender the patent by:
- Giving notice to the Controller
- Advertising the intention to surrender
- If no opposition, patent can be surrendered

**Why Surrender?**
- Avoid paying renewal fees
- If the invention is no longer commercially viable
- Strategic business reasons

---

## 🔄 6. Assignments and Licensing of Patents

Patents, being property rights, can be transferred or licensed to others. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for commercializing inventions.

### Assignment of Patents (Section 68-71)

**What is Assignment?**

Assignment is the transfer of ownership of a patent from one person (assignor) to another (assignee).

**Requirements:**

**1. Must be in Writing:**
- Oral assignments are not valid
- Must be executed as a written document

**2. Must be Signed:**
- By the assignor or their authorized agent
- Should be signed by both parties

**3. Should be Registered:**
While not mandatory for the assignment to be valid between the parties, registration provides:
- Public notice
- Priority in case of competing claims
- Admissibility of assignment document as evidence without further proof

**Types of Assignment:**

**1. Complete Assignment:**
- All rights transferred
- Assignee becomes the new owner

**2. Partial Assignment:**
- Only some rights transferred (e.g., rights in a specific territory or for specific applications)
- Assignor retains some rights

**Rights that Can Be Assigned:**
- Right to make, use, and sell the patented product
- Right to license
- Right to sue for infringement
- Right to assign further

**Consideration:**
- Usually involves payment (lump sum or royalties)
- Can also be without consideration (gift)

**Registration of Assignment:**

To register an assignment:
- Apply to the Patent Office (Form 16)
- Submit the assignment deed
- Pay prescribed fees

**Effect of Registration:**
- Registered assignee's title recognized by the Patent Office
- Can enforce rights against infringers
- Protected against competing claims

### Licensing of Patents

**What is a License?**

A license is permission granted by the patent owner (licensor) to another person (licensee) to make, use, or sell the patented invention. Unlike assignment, ownership remains with the licensor.

**Types of Licenses:**

#### **1. Voluntary Licenses**

These are licenses granted by mutual agreement between the patent owner and the licensee.

**Exclusive License:**
- Only the licensee can exercise the licensed rights
- Even the licensor cannot exercise those rights (unless reserved)
- Exclusive licensee can sue for infringement

**Non-Exclusive License:**
- Licensor can grant licenses to multiple licensees
- Licensor can also use the patent
- Non-exclusive licensees generally cannot sue for infringement (unless the license agreement provides otherwise)

**Terms of Voluntary License:**

Usually negotiated and include:
- **Scope:** What rights are licensed (manufacture, use, sale, etc.)
- **Territory:** Geographical area where license applies
- **Duration:** How long the license lasts
- **Royalties:** Payment terms (fixed fee, percentage of sales, milestone payments)
- **Performance Obligations:** Minimum sales, quality standards, etc.
- **Improvements:** Rights to improvements made by either party
- **Sublicensing:** Whether licensee can grant sublicenses
- **Termination:** Grounds and procedures for ending the license

#### **2. Compulsory Licenses (Sections 84-92)**

Compulsory licenses are granted by the government, allowing a third party to use the patent without the patent owner's consent.

**When Can Compulsory Licenses Be Granted?**

**Section 84 - General Grounds:**

After 3 years from the grant of the patent, any interested person can apply for a compulsory license if:

**1. Reasonable Requirements Not Satisfied:**
The reasonable requirements of the public with respect to the patented invention have not been satisfied.

**What Does This Mean?**
- The invention is not available in sufficient quantity
- The invention is not available at reasonably affordable prices
- Demand exceeds supply

**Example:** A patented life-saving drug is available but at such a high price that most people cannot afford it.

**2. Invention Not Available:**
The patented invention is not available to the public at a reasonably affordable price.

**3. Not Worked in India:**
The patented invention is not worked (manufactured) in the territory of India.

**Note:** Simply importing the patented product into India doesn't satisfy the working requirement.

**Section 84(6) - Reasonable Period:**
The Controller won't grant a compulsory license unless satisfied that the applicant has:
- Made efforts to obtain a voluntary license on reasonable terms
- Such efforts have not been successful within a reasonable period

**Section 84(7) - Anti-Competitive Practices:**

If the use of the patented invention is found to be:
- Mischievous to the state or prejudicial to trade or industry
- Unfair, as determined by Competition Commission or other authorities

Then, a compulsory license can be granted (without the 3-year waiting period or prior negotiation requirement).

**Section 92 - National Emergency/Public Health:**

In circumstances of **national emergency** or **extreme urgency** or **public non-commercial use**, the Central Government can issue a compulsory license (even without prior negotiation).

**Examples:**
- Health epidemics (HIV/AIDS, COVID-19)
- Natural disasters
- War or threat to national security

**Section 92A - Compulsory License for Export:**

If a country lacking manufacturing capacity needs to import a patented pharmaceutical product, and that country has issued a compulsory license, India can grant a compulsory license to manufacture and export to that country.

**Notable Indian Compulsory License: Natco v. Bayer (2012)**

**Case:** Natco Pharma applied for a compulsory license for Bayer's patented cancer drug Nexavar (Sorafenib Tosylate).

**Grounds:**
- Bayer was selling the drug at an exorbitantly high price (approximately ₹2.8 lakh per month)
- Very few patients could afford it
- Bayer was importing the drug, not manufacturing in India (not working the patent)

**Held:**
The Controller granted a compulsory license:
- Natco was allowed to manufacture and sell a generic version
- Natco had to pay Bayer a royalty of 6% of net sales
- Natco's price: approximately ₹8,800 per month (dramatically more affordable)

**Significance:**
- First compulsory license granted in India since 1970
- Affirmed India's commitment to access to medicines
- Set a precedent for using Section 84

#### **3. Licenses of Right (Section 93)**

A patentee can voluntarily offer to grant licenses to anyone on reasonable terms by:
- Applying to the Controller
- Endorsement "Licenses of Right" made on the patent

**Benefits:**
- Renewal fees reduced by 50%
- Demonstrates willingness to share the invention

**Anyone Can Apply for License:**
Once endorsed, anyone can apply for a license. If terms cannot be agreed upon, the Controller settles the terms.

#### **Terms of Compulsory Licenses**

**Scope and Duration (Section 84(4)):**
- Limited to the purpose for which granted
- Reasonable duration

**Non-Exclusive (Section 84(5)):**
- Compulsory licenses are always non-exclusive
- Patent owner can still work the patent or grant other licenses

**Non-Assignable (Section 84(5)):**
- Cannot be assigned independently
- Can only be transferred with the business/enterprise that uses the patent

**Predominantly for Domestic Market (Section 84(5)):**
- Production under compulsory license must be predominantly for the domestic market (except under Section 92A for export)

**Remuneration (Section 90):**
- Licensee must pay the patentee adequate remuneration
- Controller determines the amount, considering:
  - Economic value of the license
  - Nature of the invention
  - Royalty rates in similar cases

**Revocation of Compulsory License:**

If circumstances change (e.g., reasonable requirements of the public are now being met), the compulsory license can be revoked.

### Governmental Use (Section 100)

The Central Government or any person authorized by it can use any patented invention:
- For purposes of government
- Including defense, health, and public welfare

**Conditions:**
- Must inform the patentee
- Must pay reasonable remuneration
- Use must be for government purposes

## 🚫 7. Infringement of Patent & Remedies

### What is Patent Infringement?

Patent infringement occurs when a person, without the patent owner's permission, makes, uses, sells, offers to sell, or imports the patented invention (for product patents) or uses the patented process (for process patents).

**Elements of Infringement:**

**1. Valid Patent:**
There must be a valid, enforceable patent.

**2. Infringement of Claims:**
The allegedly infringing product or process must fall within the scope of the patent claims.

**3. No Permission:**
The infringer must not have the patent owner's permission (no license).

**4. Within Patent Term:**
The patent must still be in force (not expired, not lapsed due to non-payment of fees).

**5. Within Territory:**
The infringement must occur in India (for Indian patents).

### Types of Infringement

**1. Direct Infringement:**
Making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing the patented product or using the patented process.

**Example:** A company manufactures and sells a product that is covered by another company's valid patent, without permission.

**2. Indirect Infringement (Contributory Infringement):**

Though not explicitly defined in the Patents Act, courts recognize indirect infringement:

**Supplying Components:**
Supplying a component of the patented invention, knowing it will be used to infringe the patent.

**Example:** Selling a key component of a patented machine, knowing the buyer intends to assemble and use the patented machine.

**Inducing Infringement:**
Actively encouraging or instructing others to infringe.

**Example:** A company provides instructions to customers on how to use a product in a way that infringes a patent.

### Determining Infringement: Claim Interpretation

**Claims Define the Invention:**

The patent claims define the boundaries of the patent. Infringement is determined by comparing the allegedly infringing product/process with the claims.

**Two-Step Test:**

**Step 1: Construe (Interpret) the Claims**
- Determine what the claims mean
- Consider the specification, drawings, and prosecution history
- Apply the knowledge of a person skilled in the art

**Step 2: Compare with Alleged Infringement**
- Does the accused product/process include every element of the claim?
- If yes, there is literal infringement
- If not, consider the doctrine of equivalents

**Literal Infringement:**

The accused product/process contains every element of the patent claim, exactly as claimed or with only insubstantial differences.

**Doctrine of Equivalents:**

Even if there's no literal infringement, there may be infringement if the accused product/process performs substantially the same function, in substantially the same way, to achieve substantially the same result.

**Example:**
Patent claims a device using a screw to fasten components. Accused device uses a bolt (which is functionally equivalent). May infringe under the doctrine of equivalents.

### Defenses to Infringement

Even if infringement is established, the accused infringer may have defenses:

**1. Invalidity of Patent:**
The patent is invalid (lacks novelty, obviousness, etc.) and should be revoked.

**2. Non-Infringement:**
The accused product/process doesn't fall within the scope of the claims.

**3. License:**
The accused has a valid license (express or implied).

**4. Prior Use:**
The accused was using the invention before the patent was filed (prior user rights).

**5. Experimental Use:**
Use was for research, experimentation, or teaching (not commercial).

### Remedies for Infringement (Section 108)

When infringement is established, the patent owner can seek various remedies:

**1. Injunction (Section 108(a)):**

A court order directing the infringer to stop the infringing activity.

**Interim Injunction:**
- Temporary injunction during trial
- Granted if:
  - Prima facie case established
  - Balance of convenience favors the patentee
  - Irreparable harm would result without injunction

**Permanent Injunction:**
- Final order after trial
- Prohibits future infringement

**Example:** Court orders a company to stop manufacturing and selling the infringing product.

**2. Damages or Account of Profits (Section 108(b)):**

Monetary compensation for the harm suffered.

**Damages:**
- Compensate the patent owner for losses due to infringement
- Calculated based on:
  - Lost sales
  - Price erosion
  - Royalty the infringer should have paid

**Account of Profits:**
- Alternative to damages
- Infringer must pay over the profits made from the infringement
- Patent owner must elect between damages and account of profits

**Example:** Infringer made ₹1 crore profit from selling the infringing product. Court may order the infringer to pay that profit to the patent owner.

**3. Delivery Up or Destruction (Section 108(c)):**

Court can order:
- Delivery of infringing goods, materials, implements to the patent owner
- Or destruction of such goods

**Purpose:** Remove infringing goods from the market.

**4. Costs:**

The prevailing party can recover litigation costs from the other party.
