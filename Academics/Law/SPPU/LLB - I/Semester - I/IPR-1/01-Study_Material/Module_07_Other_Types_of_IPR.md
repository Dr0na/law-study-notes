# 📖 Module 07: Protection of Other Types of Intellectual Property Rights

This module covers forms of intellectual property that don't fall under the traditional categories of patents, trademarks, copyrights, designs, or geographical indications. These include layout designs of integrated circuits, plant varieties, trade secrets, and traditional knowledge.

---

## 💾 1. Layout Designs/Topographies Integrated Circuits

### What are Integrated Circuits?

An **integrated circuit (IC)**, also called a **microchip** or **chip**, is a set of electronic circuits on a small flat piece (chip) of semiconductor material, usually silicon. ICs are used in virtually all electronic equipment today - computers, smartphones, appliances, vehicles, etc.

### What is a Layout Design?

The **layout design** (or **topography**) of an integrated circuit refers to the three-dimensional disposition of the elements and interconnections of an integrated circuit, or such a three-dimensional disposition prepared for an integrated circuit intended for manufacture.

**In simpler terms:**
It's the arrangement and interconnection of the transistors, circuits, and other elements on the chip - the "blueprint" or "map" of how the chip is constructed.

**Why Protect Layout Designs?**

- **High Investment:** Developing IC layouts requires significant investment in research, design, and testing
- **Easy Copying:** Once manufactured, chips can be reverse-engineered and copied relatively easily
- **Commercial Value:** Layout designs have significant commercial value
- **Innovation:** Protection encourages continued innovation in semiconductor technology

### International Framework: TRIPS Article 35-38

TRIPS requires members to protect layout designs of integrated circuits.

**Article 35 - Relation to IPIC Treaty:**

Members agree to provide protection to layout designs in accordance with Articles 2-7 (excluding Article 6(3)), Article 12, and Article 16(3) of the **Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits (IPIC Treaty or Washington Treaty, 1989)**.

**Article 36 - Scope of Protection:**

**Protection applies to:**
- Layout designs that are original (result of creator's intellectual effort)
- Layout designs that are not commonplace among creators and manufacturers

**Rights Conferred:**
- Reproducing the protected layout design (copying)
- Importing, selling, or distributing for commercial purposes a protected layout design or products incorporating it

**Exceptions:**
- Acts done privately for non-commercial purposes
- Acts done for evaluation, analysis, research, or teaching
- Creating an original layout design as a result of evaluation or analysis (reverse engineering for creating a different, original design is allowed)

**Article 37 - Acts Not Requiring Authorization:**

**Exhaustion:** Once a product incorporating the layout design is put on the market by the right holder or with their consent, further dealings with that product are allowed (first sale doctrine).

**Innocent Infringement:** If someone incorporates an unlawfully reproduced layout design into a product without knowing it was unlawful, they can continue to sell existing stock but must pay reasonable royalty for future sales.

**Article 38 - Term of Protection:**

At least **10 years** from:
- The date of filing an application for registration, OR
- The first commercial exploitation anywhere in the world

### Indian Law: Semiconductor Integrated Circuits Layout-Design Act, 2000

India enacted this Act to comply with TRIPS and protect layout designs.

#### **Key Features**

**Eligibility (Section 2(k), 9):**

A layout design is registrable if it is:
- **Original:** Result of the creator's intellectual effort
- **Not Commonplace:** Not commonplace among creators and manufacturers of IC at the time of creation

**Who Can Apply (Section 10):**

- The creator of the layout design
- Assignee of the creator
- Legal representative

**Procedure for Registration:**

1. **Application:** File with the Semiconductor Integrated Circuits Layout-Design Registry
2. **Examination:** Examiner checks for formalities and eligibility
3. **Registration:** If in order, the layout design is registered

  - An article incorporating such an IC (insofar as it continues to contain an unlawfully reproduced layout design)

**Exceptions (Section 16):**

The following do NOT infringe:

1. **Private and Non-Commercial Use:** Acts done privately and for non-commercial purposes
2. **Evaluation, Analysis, Research, Teaching:** Use for these purposes
3. **Reverse Engineering:** Creating an original layout design as a result of evaluation or analysis (permitted to promote innovation)
4. **Exhaustion:** Once a product is sold by the proprietor, further dealing with that product doesn't infringe

**Term of Protection (Section 18):**

**10 years** from:
- The date of filing the application for registration, OR
- The date of first commercial exploitation anywhere in the world (whichever is earlier)

**Infringement and Remedies (Section 22):**

## 🌱 2. Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights

### What are Plant Varieties?

A **plant variety** is a distinct, uniform, and stable population of cultivated plants that is distinguishable by specific characteristics.

**Examples:**
- Different varieties of rice (e.g., Basmati, Sona Masuri, IR-20)
- Different varieties of wheat
- Different varieties of cotton (e.g., Bt Cotton)

### Why Protect Plant Varieties?

- **Encourage Breeding:** Plant breeding requires significant time, effort, and investment. Protection provides incentives
- **Benefit Farmers:** Improved varieties increase agricultural productivity
- **Preserve Biodiversity:** Encourages conservation of plant genetic resources
- **Balance Rights:** Balance between breeders' rights and farmers' rights (especially in developing countries like India)

### International Framework

#### **TRIPS Article 27.3(b)**

Members shall provide for the protection of plant varieties either by:
- **Patents**, OR
- By an **effective sui generis system** (a special system designed specifically for plant varieties), OR
- By a **combination** of both

**"Sui generis" means:** Of its own kind; unique

Most countries have opted for sui generis systems, often based on the UPOV Convention.

#### **UPOV Convention (International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants)**

The UPOV Convention establishes an international system for plant variety protection.

**Established:** 1961 (revised 1972, 1978, 1991)

**Key Features:**

**Plant Breeders' Rights (PBR):**
Rights granted to breeders of new plant varieties.

**Eligibility Criteria (DUS):**
- **Distinct:** Clearly distinguishable from any other known variety
- **Uniform:** Sufficiently uniform in its relevant characteristics
- **Stable:** Remains true to its description after repeated reproduction

**Rights Conferred:**
- Exclusive right to produce, reproduce, sell, export, import the variety
- Others cannot use the variety for commercial purposes without permission

**Term:**
Minimum 20 years for most plants, 25 years for trees and vines.

**Breeder's Exemption:**
Other breeders can use the protected variety for research and breeding new varieties.

**Farmer's Exemption:**
Farmers can save seed from their harvest for replanting on their own land (extent varies by UPOV version).

**Note:** UPOV 1991 is more restrictive on farmers' rights than UPOV 1978.

### Indian Law: Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001 (PPV&FR Act)

India chose the sui generis route and enacted a unique law that balances breeders' rights with farmers' rights.

#### **Objectives**

- Protect plant breeders' rights (to encourage investment in plant breeding)
- Protect farmers' rights (recognize farmers' contribution, allow seed saving and sharing)
- Promote biodiversity conservation
- Facilitate growth of the seed industry

#### **Types of Varieties Eligible for Registration (Section 15, 16)**

**1. New Varieties:**
Varieties that meet the DUS criteria (Distinct, Uniform, Stable) and are new.

**2. Extant Varieties:**
Varieties that are currently in use, even if they don't meet all novelty requirements. This includes:
- Farmers' varieties (varieties developed by farmers)
- Varieties in the public domain
- Varieties about which there is common knowledge

**Rationale:** Recognizes that varieties already in use have value and should be recorded and protected.

#### **Eligibility Criteria (Section 15)**

**1. Novelty:**
The variety must be new:
- Not sold or disposed of in India for more than one year before the date of application
- Not sold or disposed of outside India for more than specified periods (usually 4-6 years depending on the plant type)

**Relaxed for Extant Varieties.**

**2. Distinctness:**
Clearly distinguishable by at least one essential characteristic from any other variety whose existence is a matter of common knowledge.

**3. Uniformity:**
Subject to the variation expected from the propagation method, sufficiently uniform in its relevant characteristics.

**4. Stability:**
The essential characteristics remain unchanged after repeated propagation or, in case of a particular cycle of propagation, at the end of each cycle.

#### **Farmers' Rights (Sections 39-41)**

**This is a unique and progressive feature of Indian law.**

**1. Right to Save, Use, Sow, Resow, Exchange, Share, or Sell Farm Produce (Section 39(1)(iv)):**

Farmers have the right to save, use, sow, resow, exchange, share seed, or even **sell farm produce** of a registered variety.

**However:** Farmers **cannot sell branded seed** of a registered variety.

**What This Means:**
- Farmer can save seed from their harvest and plant it next year (farmer's exemption)
- Farmer can share or exchange seed with other farmers
- Farmer can sell the harvested crop (farm produce like rice, wheat)
- Farmer **cannot** sell packaged, branded seed for commercial planting by others

**2. Right to Register Farmers' Varieties (Section 39(1)(iii)):**

Farmers or groups of farmers can apply to register farmers' varieties (varieties developed by farmers through selection and preservation over generations).

**3. Right to Compensation (Section 41):**

If a breeder uses farmers' varieties in developing a new variety, the benefit-sharing mechanism ensures farmers receive compensation.

**4. Protection from Innocent Infringement (Section 42):**

Farmers are not liable for infringement if they were not aware and had no reasonable grounds to believe the variety was protected.

#### **Essentially Derived Varieties (EDV) (Section 2(i))**

An **essentially derived variety (EDV)** is a variety that:
- Is predominantly derived from an initial variety (or a variety that itself is derived from the initial variety)
- Is clearly distinguishable from the initial variety
- Conforms (except for differences resulting from derivation) to the initial variety in the expression of essential characteristics

**Purpose:** Prevents "cosmetic breeding" - making minor changes to an existing variety and claiming it as new. EDVs require authorization from the breeder of the initial variety.

#### **Rights Conferred (Section 28)**

Exclusive right to:
- Produce, sell, market, distribute, import, export the variety

**Exceptions:**
- Farmers' rights (as discussed)
- Researchers' rights (use for research and breeding)

#### **Term of Protection (Section 24)**

- **Trees and vines:** 18 years
- **Other crops:** 15 years
- **Extant varieties:** 15 years from the date of notification of that variety by the Central Government

#### **Compulsory Licensing (Section 47)**

If a registered variety is not available to the public at a reasonable price, the Authority may grant a compulsory license to make the variety available.

#### **Benefit Sharing (Section 26)**

When a breeder commercializes a variety that uses farmers' varieties or relies on traditional knowledge, a portion of the benefits must be deposited in the **National Gene Fund** for benefit-sharing with the farming community.

## 🔒 3. Protection of Confidential Information & Trade Secrets

### What are Trade Secrets?

**Trade secrets** are confidential business information that provides a competitive advantage. Unlike patents, which require public disclosure, trade secrets remain secret.

**Examples:**
- Coca-Cola formula (famously kept secret for over a century)
- KFC's "11 herbs and spices" recipe
- Google's search algorithm
- Customer lists
- Manufacturing processes
- Business strategies
- Financial information

### Requirements for Trade Secret Protection

**1. Secrecy:**
The information must be secret (not generally known or easily accessible).

**2. Commercial Value:**
The information must have commercial value because it is secret.

**3. Reasonable Steps to Maintain Secrecy:**
The holder must take reasonable steps to keep it secret (NDAs, access controls, security measures).

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Trade Secrets

**Advantages:**

✅ **No Time Limit:** Unlike patents (20 years), trade secrets can last indefinitely as long as secrecy is maintained

✅ **No Registration:** No need to file applications, pay fees, or undergo examination

✅ **No Disclosure:** Unlike patents, you don't have to disclose your invention to the public

✅ **Cost-Effective:** No application or maintenance fees

**Disadvantages:**

❌ **Can Be Lost:** If someone independently discovers or reverse-engineers the information, you lose protection

❌ **Difficult to Enforce:** If someone steals your trade secret, it can be hard to prove and enforce rights

❌ **No Protection Against Independent Discovery:** If two people independently develop the same information, both can use it

❌ **Vulnerable to Employee Turnover:** Risk that employees will leave and share information (despite NDAs)

### International Framework: TRIPS Article 39

TRIPS requires members to protect "undisclosed information" (trade secrets).

**Article 39.2 - Protection of Undisclosed Information:**

Natural and legal persons shall have the possibility of preventing information lawfully within their control from being disclosed to, acquired by, or used by others without their consent in a manner contrary to honest commercial practices, provided that such information:

**a) Is Secret:**
Not generally known or readily accessible to persons in circles that normally deal with the kind of information in question.

**b) Has Commercial Value:**
Because it is secret.

**c) Has Been Subject to Reasonable Steps:**
To keep it secret by the person lawfully in control.

**"Contrary to Honest Commercial Practices" includes:**
- Breach of contract
- Breach of confidence
- Inducement to breach
- Acquisition of undisclosed information by third parties who knew, or should have known, the information was obtained through such practices

### Protection in India

India does **not have a specific trade secrets law**. However, trade secrets are protected through various legal mechanisms:

#### **1. Contract Law (Indian Contract Act, 1872)**

**Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs):**
Parties can enter into contracts requiring confidentiality. Breach of such agreements gives rise to contractual remedies.

**Example:** An employer can require employees to sign NDAs preventing disclosure of confidential information.

**Remedies:**
- Injunction (court order to prevent disclosure)
- Damages for breach of contract

#### **2. Law of Equity and Breach of Confidence**

**Common Law Doctrine:**
Courts recognize a duty of confidence where information is shared in confidence.

**Requirements:**
- Information must be confidential
- Information must be communicated in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence
- There must be unauthorized use of that information to the detriment of the party communicating it

**Example:** An employee who learns confidential information during employment has a duty not to disclose it, even absent a written NDA.

**Remedies:**
- Injunction
- Damages for breach of confidence

#### **3. Employment Law**

**Implied Duty of Fidelity:**
Employees have an implied duty not to disclose confidential information obtained during employment.

**Post-Employment Restrictions:**
Employment contracts can include non-compete and non-disclosure clauses (though non-compete clauses are limited under Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act).

#### **4. Intellectual Property Laws**

**Copyright:**
Documents containing trade secrets (manuals, designs, formulas written down) may be protected by copyright.

**Patents:**
If the trade secret qualifies as an invention, it could be patented (though this requires disclosure, which defeats the purpose of keeping it secret).

#### **5. Criminal Law**

**Indian Penal Code Provisions:**

- **Section 405 (Criminal Breach of Trust):** Misappropriating confidential information entrusted to someone
- **Section 408 (Criminal Breach of Trust by Employee):** Specific provision for employees

#### **6. Information Technology Act, 2000**

**Section 43, 66, 72:**
Provisions against unauthorized access to computer systems, data theft, and breach of confidentiality can apply to digital trade secrets.

### Best Practices for Protecting Trade Secrets

**1. Identify Trade Secrets:**
Determine what information is confidential and valuable.

**2. Implement Security Measures:**
- Physical security (locked cabinets, restricted access areas)
- Digital security (passwords, encryption, access controls)
- Limit access on a need-to-know basis

**3. Use Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs):**
With employees, contractors, business partners, anyone accessing confidential information.

**4. Mark Documents as Confidential:**
Clearly label confidential documents.

**5. Train Employees:**
Educate employees about confidentiality obligations.

**6. Exit Procedures:**
When employees leave, ensure they return all confidential materials and remind them of continuing obligations.

**7. Monitor Compliance:**
Regular audits to ensure security measures are followed.

## 🌿 4. Protection of Traditional Knowledge and Biodiversity

### What is Traditional Knowledge (TK)?

**Traditional knowledge** refers to knowledge, innovations, and practices of indigenous and local communities that have been developed over generations and are often passed down orally. This includes knowledge about:

- Medicinal plants and their uses (traditional medicine like Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani)
- Agricultural practices
- Environmental management
- Handicrafts and textiles
- Cultural expressions (folklore, music, art)

**Examples:**
- Traditional uses of turmeric (antiseptic, anti-inflammatory)
- Use of neem for various medicinal and agricultural purposes
- Traditional rice cultivation techniques
- Ayurvedic formulations

### What is Biodiversity?

**Biodiversity** (biological diversity) refers to the variety of life on Earth - diversity of species, ecosystems, and genetic variation within species.

**Link to Traditional Knowledge:**
Local communities often possess knowledge about biodiversity - which plants have medicinal properties, how to cultivate crops sustainably, etc.

### Why Protect Traditional Knowledge and Biodiversity?

**1. Prevent Biopiracy:**
"Biopiracy" refers to the appropriation of traditional knowledge and biological resources by others (often foreign entities) without permission or compensation.

**Famous Examples:**
- **Turmeric Patent (US Patent 5,401,504):** University of Mississippi obtained a patent for turmeric's wound-healing properties. India successfully challenged it, arguing this was traditional knowledge known in India for centuries.
- **Neem Patent:** European Patent Office granted a patent for neem's fungicidal properties. India challenged and got it revoked, as neem's uses were traditional knowledge.
- **Basmati Patent:** US company RiceTec obtained a patent claiming a "Basmati" rice variety. After challenges, the patent was significantly narrowed.

**2. Recognition and Compensation:**
Communities that developed and preserved this knowledge deserve recognition and benefit from its commercial exploitation.

**3. Conservation:**
Protecting biodiversity ensures sustainable use and conservation of biological resources.

**4. Cultural Heritage:**
Traditional knowledge is part of cultural identity and heritage.

### Challenges in Protecting Traditional Knowledge

**1. Not Novel:**
TK is often not "new" in the patent sense (it's been used for generations), so it doesn't qualify for patents.

**2. Collectively Held:**
TK is often held collectively by communities, not individuals, making it hard to fit into IP systems designed for individual ownership.

**3. Oral Tradition:**
Much TK is passed down orally, without written documentation, making it hard to prove prior art.

**4. Lack of Documentation:**
Without documentation, it's difficult to prevent others from claiming TK as their own invention.

### International Framework

#### **Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD, 1992)**

**Key Principles:**

**1. Sovereign Rights:**
States have sovereign rights over their biological resources.

**2. Access and Benefit-Sharing (ABS):**
Access to genetic resources should be subject to **prior informed consent** of the country providing the resources, and there should be **fair and equitable sharing** of benefits arising from their use.

**3. Traditional Knowledge:**
Recognizes the contribution of indigenous and local communities to biodiversity conservation and requires respect for their knowledge and practices.

**India ratified the CBD in 1994.**

#### **Nagoya Protocol (2010)**

An **international agreement** supplementing the CBD, providing a legal framework for:
- Access to genetic resources
- Fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization

**Key Elements:**
- Prior informed consent from countries providing genetic resources
- Mutually agreed terms for benefit-sharing
- Compliance measures

**India ratified the Nagoya Protocol in 2012.**

#### **TRIPS and Traditional Knowledge**

**Article 27.3(b):**
Allows exclusion of plants and animals from patentability (recognizing that these may be part of traditional knowledge and biodiversity).

**Article 29.1:**
Requires disclosure of the invention in the patent application. Some argue this should include disclosure of the source of biological materials and traditional knowledge used.

**Debates:**
Developing countries (including India) have been pushing for amendments to TRIPS to require:
- Disclosure of the origin of biological materials and traditional knowledge
- Evidence of prior informed consent and benefit-sharing agreements

### Protection in India

India has taken several measures to protect traditional knowledge and biodiversity:

#### **1. Biological Diversity Act, 2002**

**Objectives:**
- Conservation of biological diversity
- Sustainable use of biological resources
- Fair and equitable sharing of benefits

**Key Provisions:**

**National Biodiversity Authority (NBA):**
Established to implement the Act.

**Prior Approval Required (Section 3, 4):**
- Foreign individuals, companies must obtain approval from NBA before accessing biological resources or associated traditional knowledge for research, commercial use, or bio-survey.
- Indian companies/individuals need to inform State Biodiversity Boards before accessing biological resources for commercial use.

**Benefit-Sharing:**
Beneficiaries of biological resources or traditional knowledge must share benefits with the communities and conservers of the resources.

**Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs):**
At local level to document and manage biodiversity and traditional knowledge.

**People's Biodiversity Registers (PBRs):**
Documenting local biodiversity and associated traditional knowledge at the community level.

**Penalties:**
Violations can result in imprisonment and fines.

#### **2. Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL)**

**Launched:** 2001 (by Council of Scientific and Industrial Research - CSIR and Ministry of AYUSH)

**Purpose:**
Document traditional knowledge (especially from Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, Yoga) in a digitized, classified, and structured format to prevent misappropriation through patent systems.

**How It Works:**

- Traditional knowledge from ancient texts is documented in five international languages (English, Japanese, French, German, Spanish) and classified according to international patent classification
- Made available to patent offices worldwide (EPO, USPTO, JPO, etc.) to use as prior art during patent examination
- Prevents granting of patents on inventions that are actually traditional knowledge

**Success:**
Several patent applications based on traditional knowledge have been challenged and rejected using TKDL data.

#### **3. Patents Act Amendments**

**Section 3(p):**
Excludes from patentability: "an invention which, in effect, is traditional knowledge or which is an aggregation or duplication of known properties of traditionally known component or components."

**Section 10(4)(d)(ii):**
Requires disclosure of the source and geographical origin of biological material used in the invention.

**Section 25(1)(k) and (2)(k):**
Grounds for opposition/revocation include failure to disclose or wrongful disclosure of source/geographical origin of biological material.

#### **4. Benefit-Sharing Mechanisms**

**National Biodiversity Fund:**
Benefits arising from commercial use of biological resources and traditional knowledge are deposited in funds managed by NBA/SBBs for benefit-sharing with local communities.

### International Efforts and Debates

**WIPO Intergovernmental Committee (IGC):**
WIPO has an Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge, and Folklore working towards international legal instruments for protection.

**Debates:**
- How to balance TK protection with access for research and innovation?
- How to define and document TK?
- How to ensure benefit-sharing is fair and reaches local communities?
