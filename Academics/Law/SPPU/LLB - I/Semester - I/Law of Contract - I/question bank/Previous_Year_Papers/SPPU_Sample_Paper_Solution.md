## Q1) Define proposal. Explain the essential elements of a valid proposal.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Introduction
A proposal (or offer) is the first essential step in the formation of a contract. It represents the willingness of one party to enter into a contract with another party on specified terms. The Indian Contract Act, 1872 provides a comprehensive framework for understanding what constitutes a valid proposal.

#### Definition of Proposal - Section 2(a)

**Section 2(a) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 states:**
"When one person signifies to another his willingness to do or to abstain from doing anything, with a view to obtaining the assent of that other to such act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal."

**Elements of Definition:**
1. **Signifies willingness** - Must communicate intention
2. **To another person** - Must be communicated to someone
3. **To do or abstain from doing** - Positive or negative act
4. **With a view to obtaining assent** - Intent to create legal relations

**Terminology:**
- Person making proposal = Proposer/Offeror
- Person to whom proposal made = Offeree

#### Essential Elements of a Valid Proposal

**1. Expression of Willingness**

The proposer must express clear willingness to do or abstain from doing something. Mere statement of intention or desire is not a proposal.

**Example:** A says "I am thinking of selling my car" - This is not a proposal, merely a statement of intention.

**Valid Proposal:** "I am willing to sell my car for ₹5 lakhs" - This expresses willingness clearly.

**2. Intention to Create Legal Relations**

The proposal must be made with intention to create legal obligations enforceable by law. Social invitations, friendly agreements, or domestic arrangements do not constitute proposals.

**Example:** 
- A invites B to dinner - Not a proposal (social)
- A offers to sell goods to B for payment - Valid proposal (commercial)

**3. Communication of Proposal**

The proposal must be communicated to the offeree. A person cannot accept a proposal of which he has no knowledge.

**Case Law: Lalman Shukla v. Gauri Dutt (1913)**
**Facts:** 
- Gauri Dutt's nephew absconded
- He sent his servant Lalman Shukla to trace the boy
- After servant left, Gauri Dutt announced a reward for finding the boy
- Servant found the boy but was unaware of reward announcement
- Servant later claimed reward

**Held:** No contract. Servant had no knowledge of the offer (reward announcement) at the time he performed the act (finding boy). For acceptance, knowledge of proposal is essential.

**Principle:** Communication of proposal to offeree is mandatory.

**4. Definite and Certain Terms**

The terms of the proposal must be clear, definite, certain, and unambiguous. Vague or uncertain proposals cannot form valid contracts.

**Case Law: Guthing v. Lynn (1831)**
**Facts:** An offer was made to pay additional money if a horse proved "lucky."
**Held:** Void for uncertainty. "Lucky" is vague and uncertain. Courts cannot enforce vague terms.

**Case Law: Scammel v. Ouston (1941)**
**Facts:** Agreement to buy goods "on hire-purchase terms" without specifying which terms.
**Held:** Too vague and uncertain. No contract formed.

**Valid Example:** "I will sell 100 kg rice at ₹50 per kg, delivery on 15th January" - Clear and definite.

**5. Distinguished from Invitation to Offer**

A proposal must be distinguished from an invitation to offer (invitation to treat). An invitation to offer is merely an invitation to others to make proposals.

**Case Law: Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v. Boots Cash Chemists (1953)**
**Facts:** 
- Boots operated self-service pharmacy
- Goods displayed on shelves with price tags
- Question: At what point is contract formed?

**Held:** 
- Display of goods is invitation to offer, not an offer
- Customer makes offer by taking goods to cash counter
- Shopkeeper accepts or rejects at counter
- Contract formed at cash counter, not at shelf

**Examples:**
| **Invitation to Offer** | **Actual Offer** |
|------------------------|------------------|
| Display of goods in shop | Customer brings goods to counter |
| Advertisement of auction | Bid made by bidder |
| Prospectus of company | Application for shares |
| Menu card in restaurant | Placing order |
| Tender notice | Submission of tender |

**6. May Be Specific or General**

**Specific Proposal:** Made to a specific person or group of persons.
**Example:** A offers to sell car to B specifically.

**General Proposal:** Made to world at large. Anyone can accept by performing conditions.

**Case Law: Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. (1893)**
**Facts:**
- Company advertised: "£100 reward to anyone who uses smoke ball as directed and still gets flu"
- Company deposited £1,000 in bank showing sincerity
- Mrs. Carlill used smoke ball as directed, got flu, claimed reward
- Company refused, arguing: (1) Not serious offer (2) No communication of acceptance (3) No consideration

**Held:**
1. Valid offer to world at large (general offer)
2. Advertisement was definite offer, not mere puff
3. Acceptance by performing conditions - no prior communication needed
4. Inconvenience of using product is consideration
5. Mrs. Carlill entitled to £100

**Significance:** General offers can be made to public at large and accepted by anyone performing conditions.

**7. May Be Express or Implied**

**Express Proposal:** Made by words, spoken or written.
**Example:** Written offer to sell property, verbal offer to provide services.

**Implied Proposal:** Made by conduct, not words.
**Example:** 
- Standing at taxi stand implies offer to provide taxi service
- Displaying goods for sale in shop (though invitation, the subsequent transaction involves implied acceptance)

**8. Proposal Must Be Distinguished from Statement of Price**

Mere statement of price or information is not a proposal.

**Case Law: Harvey v. Facey (1893)**
**Facts:**
- H telegraphed F: "Will you sell Bumper Hall Pen? Telegraph lowest cash price"
- F replied: "Lowest price £900"
- H telegraphed: "We agree to buy for £900"
- F refused to sell

**Held:** 
- F's telegram was merely statement of information (price)
- Not an offer to sell at that price
- Mere supply of information ≠ proposal
- No contract formed

**9. Proposal May Be Conditional**

Proposal may be subject to conditions, which must be clearly stated.

**Example:** "I will sell my house for ₹50 lakhs if I get transfer to another city within 3 months."

**10. Proposal Must Not Be Vague**

Certainty is essential. Ambiguous or incomplete proposals are invalid.

**Case Law: Hillas & Co. v. Arcos Ltd. (1932)**
**Facts:** Agreement for timber of "fair specification."
**Held:** Not vague. "Fair specification" can be determined by trade practice and course of dealing.

**Principle:** Courts may uphold proposal if meaning can be determined from trade usage or circumstances.

#### Summary of Valid Proposal Requirements

| **Element** | **Requirement** | **If Not Met** |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Expression** | Clear willingness | Not a proposal |
| **Intent** | Create legal relations | Not enforceable |
| **Communication** | To offeree | Cannot be accepted |
| **Certainty** | Definite terms | Void for uncertainty |
| **Distinction** | Not invitation to offer | No binding offer |
| **Clarity** | Unambiguous | May be invalid |

#### Practical Importance

Understanding essential elements ensures:
1. Valid contract formation
2. Clarity about when contract comes into existence
3. Distinction from preliminary negotiations
4. Protection of both parties' interests
5. Avoiding disputes about contract validity

#### Conclusion

A valid proposal under Section 2(a) must express clear willingness to do or abstain from doing something, be communicated to the offeree, have definite and certain terms, and be made with intention to create legal relations. It must be distinguished from mere statements of intention, invitations to offer, and supply of information. Case laws like Lalman Shukla, Carlill, and Pharmaceutical Society v. Boots illustrate these principles clearly. Understanding these essentials is fundamental to contract formation, as proposal and acceptance together create a binding promise. The proposer's offer, when accepted absolutely and unconditionally, transforms into a promise and subsequently into a contract, making the comprehension of proposal requirements crucial for legal practitioners and business persons alike.

## Q2) "All contracts are agreements but all agreements are not contracts". Explain.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Introduction

The statement "All contracts are agreements but all agreements are not contracts" represents a fundamental principle of contract law embodied in the Indian Contract Act, 1872. This principle establishes the relationship between agreements and contracts, clarifying that while every contract necessarily involves an agreement, not every agreement rises to the level of a legally enforceable contract.

#### Definitions

**Agreement - Section 2(e)**
"Every promise and every set of promises, forming the consideration for each other, is an agreement."

**Contract - Section 2(h)**
"An agreement enforceable by law is a contract."

**Simple Formula:**
- Agreement = Offer + Acceptance
- Contract = Agreement + Enforceability by Law

#### Understanding the Relationship

The statement can be broken into two parts:

**Part 1: "All contracts are agreements"**

This means every contract must have an agreement as its foundation. Without an agreement (offer + acceptance), there can be no contract. A contract is simply a special category of agreement - one that the law recognizes and enforces.

**Example:** When A agrees to sell a car to B for ₹5 lakhs, and B accepts, an agreement is formed. If all other legal requirements are met, this agreement becomes a contract.

**Part 2: "All agreements are not contracts"**

This means that while an agreement is necessary for a contract, it is not sufficient. An agreement becomes a contract only when it satisfies all legal requirements prescribed by Section 10 of the Indian Contract Act.

**Example:** A agrees to take B to dinner (social agreement). This is an agreement but not a contract because there's no intention to create legal relations.

#### Section 10 - What Agreements Are Contracts

**Section 10 states:**
"All agreements are contracts if they are made by the free consent of parties competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object, and are not hereby expressly declared to be void."

**Analysis of Section 10:**

For an agreement to become a contract, it must satisfy ALL of the following:

**1. Free Consent of Parties (Sections 13-14)**
- Parties must genuinely agree
- Consent not vitiated by coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake

**2. Competent to Contract (Section 11)**
- Parties must be of age of majority
- Of sound mind
- Not disqualified by law

**3. Lawful Consideration (Section 25)**
- Must have consideration (except certain exceptions)
- Consideration must be lawful

**4. Lawful Object (Sections 23-24)**
- Object must not be:
  - Forbidden by law
  - Defeating provisions of law
  - Fraudulent
  - Injurious to person or property
  - Immoral
  - Opposed to public policy

**5. Not Expressly Declared Void**
- Must not fall under agreements declared void by Act (Sections 26-30)

#### Types of Agreements That Are NOT Contracts

**1. Social or Domestic Agreements**

Agreements lacking intention to create legal relations.

**Example:** 
- A invites B to dinner at his home
- Husband promises wife to buy jewelry
- Friends agree to watch movie together

**Case Law: Balfour v. Balfour (1919)**
**Facts:** Husband working abroad promised to send wife £30 per month maintenance. Later they separated. Wife sued for maintenance.
**Held:** Domestic agreement between husband and wife while relationship cordial - not a contract. No intention to create legal relations.

**2. Agreements Without Consideration (Section 25)**

Unless falling under exceptions, agreements without consideration are void.

**Example:** A promises to gift B ₹10,000 without any return. Generally not enforceable (unless written, registered, and based on natural love and affection).

**3. Agreements with Unlawful Object or Consideration (Sections 23-24)**

**Example:** 
- Agreement to commit crime
- Agreement with immoral purpose
- Agreement to defraud

**Case Law: Gherulal Parakh v. Mahadeodas Maiya (1959)**
**Facts:** Agreement to sell 50 tonnes of gur when law prohibited sale beyond 300 kgs.
**Held:** Void as forbidden by law.

**4. Agreements with Persons Incompetent to Contract**

**Example:** Agreement with minor

**Case Law: Mohori Bibee v. Dharmodas Ghose (1903)**
**Facts:** Minor mortgaged property to money lender.
**Held:** Void ab initio. Minor incompetent to contract.

**5. Agreements Without Free Consent**

When consent obtained by coercion, undue influence, fraud, or misrepresentation - contract voidable.

**Example:** A threatens B to enter contract. Agreement exists but not valid contract (voidable at B's option).

**6. Agreements Expressly Declared Void**

**Section 26:** Restraint of marriage
**Section 27:** Restraint of trade (except exceptions)
**Section 28:** Restraint of legal proceedings
**Section 29:** Uncertain meaning
**Section 30:** Wagering agreements

**Example:** A and B bet ₹10,000 on cricket match outcome. This is agreement but void under Section 30 (wager).

**7. Vague or Uncertain Agreements (Section 29)**

**Case Law: Guthing v. Lynn (1831)**
Agreement to pay extra if horse proves "lucky" - void for uncertainty.

#### Comparison Table

| **Aspect** | **Agreement** | **Contract** |
|------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Definition** | Promise + Acceptance | Agreement + Enforceability |
| **Legal Status** | May or may not be enforceable | Always enforceable by law |
| **Requirements** | Offer and acceptance | All essentials of Section 10 |
| **Examples** | Social invitations, void agreements | Sale of goods, service contracts |
| **Enforceability** | Not necessarily | Yes, by law |
| **Court Action** | May not provide remedy | Court will enforce |

#### Practical Examples

**Example 1: Social Agreement (Not Contract)**
A and B, friends, agree to go to movie on Sunday.
- **Agreement:** Yes (mutual promises)
- **Contract:** No (no intention to create legal relations)
- **Consequence:** If B doesn't go, A cannot sue

**Example 2: Business Agreement (Contract)**
A agrees to sell 100 laptops to B for ₹50,000 each, delivery on 15th January.
- **Agreement:** Yes (offer and acceptance)
- **Contract:** Yes (all essentials satisfied)
- **Consequence:** If either party breaches, other can sue

**Example 3: Agreement with Minor (Not Contract)**
A, aged 16, agrees to buy car from B for ₹5 lakhs.
- **Agreement:** Yes (offer and acceptance occurred)
- **Contract:** No (A is minor, incompetent to contract)
- **Consequence:** Void ab initio. B cannot enforce.

**Example 4: Wagering Agreement (Not Contract)**
A and B agree to bet ₹5,000 on election results.
- **Agreement:** Yes (mutual promises)
- **Contract:** No (wagering agreement void under Section 30)
- **Consequence:** Winner cannot sue loser

**Example 5: Agreement with Unlawful Object (Not Contract)**
A agrees to pay B ₹1 lakh for stealing competitor's trade secrets.
- **Agreement:** Yes (offer and acceptance)
- **Contract:** No (unlawful object)
- **Consequence:** Void and unenforceable

#### Valid Contract Requirements - Section 10 Analysis

For Agreement → Contract transformation:

| **Requirement** | **Section** | **If Absent** | **Effect** |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| Free Consent | 13-19 | Coercion/fraud/etc. | Voidable |
| Competent Parties | 11-12 | Minor/unsound mind | Void |
| Lawful Consideration | 23, 25 | Illegal/no consideration | Void |
| Lawful Object | 23-24 | Unlawful purpose | Void |
| Not Declared Void | 26-30 | Falls under void category | Void |
| Certainty | 29 | Vague terms | Void |

#### Importance of the Distinction

**1. Legal Enforceability**
- Only contracts are enforceable by law
- Agreements remain moral or social obligations

**2. Court Intervention**
- Courts enforce contracts
- Courts generally don't enforce mere agreements

**3. Remedies Available**
- Breach of contract: Legal remedies (damages, specific performance)
- Breach of agreement: No legal remedy (only moral obligation)

**4. Business Context**
- Business transactions need contracts
- Social arrangements remain agreements

**5. Certainty in Commerce**
- Distinction provides clarity about legal obligations
- Parties know when they're bound legally vs. morally

#### Case Laws Illustrating the Principle

**1. Balfour v. Balfour (1919)**
Domestic agreement not contract due to lack of intention to create legal relations.

**2. Mohori Bibee v. Dharmodas Ghose (1903)**
Agreement with minor not contract due to incompetence.

**3. Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. (1893)**
Business advertisement was contract (all essentials present), not mere agreement.

**4. Gherulal Parakh v. Mahadeodas Maiya (1959)**
Agreement to sell prohibited quantity void (unlawful object).

#### Flowchart: Agreement to Contract

```
Agreement (Offer + Acceptance)
         ↓
    Section 10 Test
         ↓
    ┌────┴────┐
    ↓         ↓
   YES       NO
    ↓         ↓
CONTRACT   REMAINS AGREEMENT
         (Not enforceable)
```

#### Conclusion

The principle "All contracts are agreements but all agreements are not contracts" embodies the essence of contract law. It establishes that while agreement (consensus ad idem - meeting of minds) is the foundation, a contract requires much more. An agreement transforms into a contract only when it satisfies all requirements of Section 10: free consent of competent parties, lawful consideration, lawful object, and not being expressly declared void. This distinction is crucial because only contracts are enforceable by law, providing remedies for breach. Agreements lacking these elements - whether social arrangements, void agreements, or agreements with incompetent persons - remain outside the realm of legal enforcement. Understanding this distinction is fundamental for legal practitioners, business persons, and anyone entering into commitments, as it determines whether their arrangement carries legal force or remains merely a moral or social obligation. The Indian Contract Act, through its comprehensive provisions, ensures that only genuine, lawful, and freely entered bargains between competent parties receive the sanctity and protection of law.

## Q3) State the remedies available to the aggrieved person in case of breach of contract.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Introduction

Breach of contract occurs when a party to the contract fails to perform his obligations under the contract or performs them defectively. The aggrieved party (the innocent party) is entitled to certain remedies under the law. The Indian Contract Act, 1872, along with the Specific Relief Act, 1963, provides comprehensive remedies to protect the interests of the injured party.

#### Types of Breach

**1. Actual Breach:**
- Breach occurring on due date of performance
- Party fails to perform when performance becomes due

**2. Anticipatory Breach:**
- Breach before performance is due
- Party expresses intention not to perform before due date
- Or makes performance impossible by his own act

#### Remedies for Breach of Contract

### 1. Rescission of Contract (Section 65, 75)

**Meaning:**
When one party breaches contract, other party can rescind (cancel) the contract and refuse to perform his part.

**Legal Basis:** Section 65 and 75 of Indian Contract Act

**Consequences:**
- Contract becomes voidable at option of injured party
- Injured party freed from all obligations
- Entitled to compensation for any loss suffered

**Example:**
A agrees to supply goods to B on 15th January. On 10th January, A refuses to supply. B can rescind contract and refuse to pay price.

**Case Law: Karsandas v. Sheth Narottamdas (1910)**
When one party commits breach, other party can treat contract as rescinded.

### 2. Suit for Damages (Sections 73-75)

**Meaning:**
Monetary compensation for loss suffered due to breach.

**Types of Damages:**

**(a) Ordinary/General Damages (Section 73)**

Compensation for loss or damage naturally arising from breach in ordinary course of things.

**Section 73:** "When a contract has been broken, the party who suffers by such breach is entitled to receive, from the party who has broken the contract, compensation for any loss or damage caused to him thereby, which naturally arose in the usual course of things from such breach, or which the parties knew, when they made the contract, to be likely to result from the breach of it."

**Measure:** Loss must be:
- Natural consequence of breach, OR
- In contemplation of parties at time of contract

**Case Law: Hadley v. Baxendale (1854) - English**
**Facts:** Mill shaft broken. Sent to manufacturer for repair. Delayed in transit. Mill remained closed longer, causing loss of profits.
**Held:** Damages for loss of profits not recoverable. Carrier didn't know shaft was only one and delay would stop mill. Not in reasonable contemplation.

**Principle:** Only losses reasonably foreseeable at time of contract are recoverable.

**(b) Special Damages (Section 73)**

Damages for losses arising due to special circumstances which parties knew at time of contract.

**Example:** A contracts to deliver goods to B, knowing B has to re-sell to C. If A breaches, B can claim loss of profit from re-sale (special damages).

**(c) Vindictive/Punitive/Exemplary Damages**

Not generally awarded in contract breach cases in India (unlike tort). Only compensation for actual loss.

**Exception:** Breach of promise to marry - court may award some amount for injured feelings.

**Case Law: Bhim Singh v. Smt. Ramlibai (1980)**
Exemplary damages not awarded for mere breach of contract in India.

**(d) Nominal Damages**

Small sum awarded when breach proved but no substantial loss suffered.

**Example:** Seller fails to deliver goods worth ₹1,000. Buyer gets goods from elsewhere at same price. Buyer entitled to nominal damages (say ₹100) for breach, though no actual loss.

**(e) Damages for Deterioration Caused by Delay (Section 73)**

When breach is delay in performance, damages for loss due to delay.

**(f) Penalty vs. Liquidated Damages (Section 74)**

**Section 74:** "When a contract has been broken, if a sum is named in the contract as the amount to be paid in case of such breach, or if the contract contains any other stipulation by way of penalty, the party complaining of the breach is entitled, whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused thereby, to receive from the party who has broken the contract reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so named or, as the case may be, the penalty stipulated for."

**Penalty:** Amount fixed to frighten party into performance. Not genuine pre-estimate of loss.

**Liquidated Damages:** Genuine pre-estimate of probable loss.

**In India:** No distinction. Court awards reasonable compensation not exceeding stipulated amount.

**Case Law: Maula Bux v. Union of India (1970) - Supreme Court**
Section 74 makes no distinction between penalty and liquidated damages. Court can award reasonable compensation up to stipulated amount.

### 3. Suit for Specific Performance (Specific Relief Act, 1963)

**Meaning:**
Court directs the defaulting party to perform the contract as agreed.

**Legal Basis:** Sections 10-20 of Specific Relief Act, 1963

**When Available:**
- Damages inadequate remedy
- Particularly for contracts involving immovable property or unique goods

**Section 10 - When Specific Performance Granted:**

Specific performance may be granted when:
1. Monetary compensation inadequate
2. Contract relates to immovable property
3. Subject matter is unique (rare paintings, antiques)

**When NOT Granted (Section 14):**

1. Damages adequate remedy
2. Contract involves personal services
3. Contract requires continuous supervision
4. Contract is divisible and part already performed
5. Performance involves hardship

**Example:**
A agrees to sell specific plot of land to B. A later refuses. B can sue for specific performance compelling A to transfer land (because land is unique).

**Case Law: Nirmala Anand v. Advent Corporation (2002)**
Specific performance is discretionary remedy. Granted when justice, equity, and good conscience demand.

### 4. Suit for Injunction (Specific Relief Act, 1963)

**Meaning:**
Court order restraining party from doing something contrary to contract.

**Types:**

**(a) Temporary/Interim Injunction:**
Granted during pendency of suit to maintain status quo.

**(b) Perpetual/Permanent Injunction:**
Granted at end of trial as final relief.

**When Granted:**
- To prevent breach of negative covenant
- To restrain party from violating terms

**Section 38 of Specific Relief Act:**
Perpetual injunction granted to prevent breach of obligation where damages inadequate.

**Example:**
A agrees not to open competing business within 5 km after selling goodwill to B. A opens competing shop. B can get injunction restraining A.

**Case Law: Niranjan Shankar v. Century Spinning (1967)**
Court may grant injunction to enforce negative covenant if reasonable and valid.

**Limitation:**
Courts don't grant injunction to indirectly enforce personal service contracts.

**Case Law: Lumley v. Wagner (1852)**
Opera singer contracted to sing at plaintiff's theater and not at any other. She breached. Court granted injunction restraining her from singing elsewhere (negative covenant), but didn't compel her to sing at plaintiff's theater (positive covenant).

### 5. Suit for Quantum Meruit

**Meaning:**
"As much as earned" - claim for reasonable remuneration for work done.

**When Available:**
1. Contract becomes void after partial performance
2. One party abandons/repudiates contract
3. Work done under void agreement
4. Divisible contract partly performed

**Case Law: Planché v. Colburn (1831)**
Author contracted to write book. Publisher abandoned project after author completed substantial work. Author entitled to quantum meruit for work done.

**Case Law: Sumpter v. Hedges (1898)**
Builder abandoned construction halfway. Not entitled to quantum meruit as he was in default. But entitled to value of materials left behind and used by owner.

**Section 65 - Application:**
When agreement discovered void or becomes void, person receiving advantage must restore it or compensate.

### 6. Suit for Restitution

**Meaning:**
Restoration of benefits received under contract before breach.

**Legal Basis:** Sections 64-65 of Indian Contract Act

**When Applicable:**
When party rescinds contract, must restore benefits received.

**Example:**
A sells goods to B. B pays advance. A fails to deliver. B can rescind and claim refund of advance.

#### Principles Governing Damages

**1. Remoteness of Damages:**

Only proximate consequences recoverable, not remote.

**Rule in Hadley v. Baxendale:**
Damages must either:
- Arise naturally from breach in ordinary course, OR
- Be reasonably in contemplation of both parties at time of contract

**2. Mitigation of Loss (Section 73, proviso):**

**Section 73 proviso:** "...but such compensation is not to be given for any remote and indirect loss or damage sustained by reason of the breach. Explanation: In estimating the loss or damage arising from a breach of contract, the means which existed of remedying the inconvenience caused by the non-performance of the contract must be taken into account."

**Duty to Mitigate:**
Injured party must take reasonable steps to minimize loss. Cannot claim avoidable losses.

**Example:**
A contracts to supply goods. A breaches. B must buy goods from market at reasonable price, not wait indefinitely allowing loss to increase.

**Case Law: British Westinghouse v. Underground Railways (1912)**
Injured party must take reasonable steps to mitigate loss. Cannot recover for losses that could have been avoided.

**3. Certainty of Damages:**

Damages must be proved with reasonable certainty. Cannot be speculative.

**4. Causation:**

Breach must be proximate cause of loss. Loss must flow directly from breach.

#### Comparison of Remedies

| **Remedy** | **Nature** | **When Available** | **Effect** |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Rescission** | Cancellation | Substantial breach | Contract terminated |
| **Damages** | Monetary | All breaches | Compensation |
| **Specific Performance** | Compulsory performance | Unique subject matter | Performance enforced |
| **Injunction** | Restraining order | Negative covenant breach | Prevents violation |
| **Quantum Meruit** | Reasonable payment | Work done, contract void/repudiated | Payment for work |

#### Bars to Relief

**1. Delay/Laches:**
Unreasonable delay in claiming relief may bar remedy.

**2. Acquiescence:**
If party accepts breach without protest, may lose right to remedy.

**3. Waiver:**
Party may waive right to claim remedy.

**4. Time Bar (Limitation):**
Must file suit within limitation period.

#### Conclusion

The law provides comprehensive remedies to protect parties from breach of contract. The choice of remedy depends on nature of breach, subject matter of contract, and loss suffered. While damages are common remedy providing monetary compensation, specific performance and injunction ensure actual performance where damages are inadequate. The principles of remoteness, mitigation, and certainty govern award of damages, ensuring fairness. Quantum meruit provides relief for partial performance, and rescission allows termination when breach is substantial. Understanding these remedies is crucial for protecting contractual rights and ensuring justice to the aggrieved party. The remedies aim not to punish the breaching party but to place the injured party in position he would have been if contract had been performed, thereby upholding sanctity of contracts in commercial and personal transactions.

## Q4) Define 'Contingent Contract". What are the rules as to the enforcement of Contingent contract provided under Indian Contract Act, 1872.

### MODEL ANSWER:

[This answer is already comprehensively covered in 15_Marks/Contingent_Contracts.md - Question 1. I'll provide the complete answer here as well for the question paper.]

#### Introduction

Contingent contracts form an essential part of modern commercial transactions, allowing parties to structure their obligations based on uncertain future events. The Indian Contract Act, 1872 provides detailed provisions in Sections 31 to 36 regarding the nature, validity, and enforcement of contingent contracts. These provisions are particularly relevant for insurance contracts, guarantees, indemnity agreements, and conditional sales.

#### Definition - Section 31

**Section 31 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 states:**
"A 'contingent contract' is a contract to do or not to do something, if some event, collateral to such contract, does or does not happen."

**Essential Elements:**

**1. Contract to Do or Not to Do Something**
- Must be a valid contract
- Performance obligation must exist

**2. Uncertain Future Event**
- Event must be uncertain in happening
- May or may not occur

**3. Event Collateral to Contract**
- Event must be incidental/additional to main contract
- Not the main subject matter itself

**4. Happening or Non-happening**
- Contract may depend on event happening, OR
- Contract may depend on event NOT happening

**Illustration from Section 31(a):**
A makes a contract with B to buy B's horse if A survives C. This is a contingent contract.

**Illustration from Section 31(b):**
A makes a contract with B to sell a horse to B at a specified price, if C, to whom the horse has been offered, refuses to buy him. This is a contingent contract.

#### Nature of Contingent Contracts

**Characteristics:**
1. Valid contract exists from beginning
2. Performance suspended until event occurs/fails
3. Event is uncertain
4. Event is future (not past)
5. Event is beyond parties' immediate control

**Example:**
Insurance is contingent contract - insurer pays IF specified loss occurs.

#### Rules for Enforcement of Contingent Contracts

### Rule 1: Contingent on Happening of Uncertain Event - Section 32

**Section 32:** "Contingent contracts to do or not to do anything if an uncertain future event happens cannot be enforced by law unless and until that event has happened. If the event becomes impossible, such contracts become void."

**Two Parts:**

**Part 1: Enforcement**
Contract can be enforced ONLY when event happens.

**Part 2: Impossibility**
If event becomes impossible, contract becomes void.

**Illustration from Section 32:**
A makes a contract with B to buy B's horse if A survives C.
- Contract can be enforced only if A survives C
- If A dies before C, contract void (survival impossible)

**Example:**
Insurance contract to pay if fire occurs.
- Enforceable only when fire actually happens
- If policy period expires without fire, no payment due (contract fulfilled)

**Case Law: Avtar Singh v. Kartar Singh (1970)**
Contract contingent on happening of event cannot be enforced until event occurs.

### Rule 2: Contingent on Non-happening of Event - Section 33

**Section 33:** "Contingent contracts to do or not to do anything if an uncertain future event does not happen can be enforced when the happening of that event becomes impossible, and not before."

**Key Point:**
Contract enforceable when it becomes CERTAIN that event will NOT happen.

**Illustration from Section 33:**
A agrees to pay B a sum of money if a certain ship does not return.
- Ship is sunk
- Contract can be enforced when news of sinking received (return impossible)

**Example:**
A promises to employ B if C does not return from USA within 6 months.

**Enforceable when:**
- 6 months pass and C doesn't return, OR
- C dies before 6 months (return impossible)

**Practical Application:**
Insurance company agrees to pay if fire does NOT occur within 5 years.
- Enforceable when 5 years pass without fire

### Rule 3: Contingent on Conduct of Living Person - Section 34

**Section 34:** "If the future event on which a contract is contingent is the way in which a person will act at an unspecified time, the event shall be considered to become impossible when such person does anything which renders it impossible that he should so act within any definite time, or otherwise than under further contingencies."

**Meaning:**
If contract depends on how person will act, contract becomes void when person does something making specified action impossible.

**Illustration from Section 34:**
A agrees to pay B a sum of money if B marries C.
- C marries D (another person)
- Marriage of B to C now impossible
- Contract becomes void

**Case Law: Frost v. Knight (1872)**
**Facts:**
- Man promised to marry woman after his father's death
- During father's lifetime, man married another woman
- Woman sued for breach

**Held:**
- Man's action made future marriage to plaintiff impossible
- Woman could sue immediately (didn't have to wait for father's death)
- Contingent condition became impossible by defendant's own act

**Example:**
Company offers job to A if A obtains MBA degree. A takes permanent job elsewhere (full-time) making MBA unlikely. Contract may become void as obtaining MBA rendered practically impossible.

### Rule 4: Contingent on Event Within Fixed Time - Section 35 (Part 1)

**Section 35 (First Part):** "Contingent contracts to do or not to do anything if a specified uncertain event happens within a fixed time become void if, at the expiration of the time fixed, such event has not happened, or if, before the time fixed, such event becomes impossible."

**Two Situations When Contract Becomes Void:**

**Situation 1:** Time expires without event happening

**Situation 2:** Event becomes impossible before time expires

**Illustration from Section 35:**
A promises to pay B a sum of money if a certain ship returns within a year.
- Contract may be enforced if ship returns within year
- Contract becomes void:
  - If year expires and ship has not returned, OR
  - If ship is burnt within year (return impossible)

**Example:**
A agrees to buy B's property if B obtains clearance within 3 months.
- Enforceable if clearance obtained within 3 months
- Void if:
  - 3 months pass without clearance, OR
  - Application rejected before 3 months (clearance impossible)

### Rule 5: Contingent on Non-happening Within Fixed Time - Section 35 (Part 2)

**Section 35 (Second Part):** "Contingent contracts to do or not to do anything if a specified uncertain event does not happen within a fixed time may be enforced by law when the time fixed has expired and such event has not happened or, before the time fixed has expired, if it becomes certain that such event will not happen."

**Two Situations When Contract Becomes Enforceable:**

**Situation 1:** Time expires and event has not happened

**Situation 2:** Before time expires, it becomes certain event won't happen

**Illustration from Section 35:**
A promises to pay B a sum of money if a certain ship does not return within a year.
- Contract may be enforced:
  - If ship does not return within year, OR
  - If ship is burnt within year (return impossible)

**Example:**
Insurance for 5 years - pay if fire does NOT occur.
- Enforceable when 5 years pass without fire
- If building demolished before 5 years, contingency fails

### Rule 6: Contingent on Impossible Events - Section 36

**Section 36:** "Contingent agreements to do or not to do anything if an impossible event happens are void, whether the impossibility of the event is known to the parties or not."

**Key Points:**

**1. Event Impossible from Beginning**
Contract void ab initio if event was impossible when contract made.

**2. Knowledge Irrelevant**
Doesn't matter whether parties knew event was impossible.

**3. Types of Impossibility:**
- **Physical impossibility:** Inherently impossible in nature
- **Legal impossibility:** Impossible due to law

**Illustration from Section 36:**
A agrees to pay B ₹10,000 if B will marry A's daughter C.
- C was dead at time of agreement
- Agreement void (marriage to dead person impossible)

**Example 1:**
A agrees to pay B if B makes water flow uphill naturally.
**Result:** Physically impossible. Void.

**Example 2:**
A agrees to employ B if B obtains license for business that has been legally prohibited.
**Result:** Legally impossible. Void.

**Example 3:**
A agrees to pay B if B brings back person who died 10 years ago.
**Result:** Impossible. Void ab initio.

#### Summary Table of Rules

| **Section** | **Type** | **Enforceable When** | **Void When** |
|-------------|----------|---------------------|---------------|
| **32** | Event happens | Event happens | Event impossible |
| **33** | Event doesn't happen | Event impossible | Event happens |
| **34** | Conduct of person | Specified conduct | Conduct impossible |
| **35(i)** | Within time (happens) | Event within time | Time lapses OR event impossible |
| **35(ii)** | Within time (doesn't happen) | Time lapses OR event impossible before time | Event happens |
| **36** | Impossible event | Never | Always (from beginning) |

#### Practical Applications

**1. Insurance Contracts**

**Fire Insurance:**
- Contingent on fire occurring (Section 32)
- Enforceable when fire happens
- If policy expires without fire, contract fulfilled (no payment)

**Life Insurance:**
- Contingent on death of insured
- Enforceable when death occurs

**2. Guarantee Contracts**

A guarantees B's debt to C.
- Contingent on B's default (Section 32)
- A liable only if B defaults
- If B pays fully, guarantee not invoked

**3. Indemnity Contracts**

A indemnifies B against loss from specific event.
- Contingent on loss occurring
- B can claim only if loss actually happens

**4. Conditional Sale**

A agrees to sell property to B if B obtains bank loan within 2 months.
- Contingent within fixed time (Section 35)
- Enforceable if loan obtained within 2 months
- Void if 2 months pass without loan or loan rejected

**5. Employment Offers**

Company offers job to candidate if passes medical test.
- Contingent on passing test (Section 32)
- Enforceable only if test passed
- Void if fails test

#### Distinction: Contingent Contract vs. Wagering Agreement

| **Aspect** | **Contingent Contract** | **Wagering Agreement** |
|------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| **Validity** | Valid (Section 31) | Void (Section 30) |
| **Interest** | Genuine interest in subject | No interest except stake |
| **Event** | Collateral to contract | Event is essence |
| **Mutuality** | May be one-sided | Always mutual |
| **Purpose** | Business/protective | Gambling |
| **Example** | Insurance | Betting on match |

**Case Law: Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. (1893)**
Reward offer is contingent contract, not wager. Company had commercial interest.

**Case Law: Mahadeo Parshad v. Parmeshwar Sahai (1963)**
Life insurance is contingent contract, not wager. Insurable interest distinguishes it.

#### Timeline Example - Application of Rules

**Scenario:** A agrees to sell property to B if B obtains bank loan within 3 months (Section 35).

**Day 1:** Agreement made (contingent contract created)
**Day 45:** B's loan application under process (contract pending)
**Day 60:** Bank rejects loan application
**Result:** Contract becomes void immediately (event impossible before time)

**Alternative Scenario:**
**Day 90:** 3 months pass, no loan obtained
**Result:** Contract void (time expired without event)

**Alternative Scenario:**
**Day 75:** B obtains loan approval
**Result:** Contingency fulfilled. Contract enforceable. Sale must proceed.

#### Important Case Laws

**1. Frost v. Knight (1872)**
Conduct of person making contingency impossible.

**2. Taraporewalla v. Framroze (1905)**
Agreement to sell if buyer obtained funds - contingent contract.

**3. Mahadeo Parshad v. Parmeshwar Sahai (1963)**
Life insurance policy is contingent contract, not wager.

**4. Pramatha Nath v. Pradyamna Kumar (1925)**
When party prevents fulfillment of condition, cannot claim benefit.

#### Conclusion

Contingent contracts provide a flexible framework for parties to structure obligations based on uncertain future events. The Indian Contract Act, through Sections 31 to 36, provides comprehensive rules determining when such contracts become enforceable or void. Section 32 governs contracts contingent on events happening, Section 33 on events not happening, Section 34 on conduct of persons, Section 35 on events within fixed time, and Section 36 on impossible events. These provisions are essential for insurance, guarantee, indemnity, and conditional sales contracts. The key distinction from wagering agreements lies in the genuine interest parties have in the subject matter beyond mere speculation. Understanding these rules is crucial for drafting and enforcing contracts where performance depends on future uncertain events, ensuring clarity about when obligations arise and when contracts become unenforceable. The law balances the need for flexibility in commercial transactions with the requirement of certainty, ensuring that parties know exactly when they are bound to perform and when circumstances release them from obligations.

## PART – B [Answer any THREE] [3 × 10 = 30 Marks]

---

## Q5) "Minor's agreement is void" explain it with exceptions.

### MODEL ANSWER:

[This answer is covered in 10_Marks/Capacity_to_Contract.md - providing complete answer here]

#### Introduction

The contractual capacity of minors is one of the most important aspects of contract law. The law protects minors from their own improvidence and from exploitation by adults. The Indian Contract Act, 1872, particularly through Section 11 and the landmark case of Mohori Bibee v. Dharmodas Ghose (1903), establishes that minor's agreements are absolutely void.

#### Section 11 - Competency to Contract

**Section 11 states:**
"Every person is competent to contract who is—
(a) of the age of majority according to the law to which he is subject; and
(b) of sound mind; and
(c) is not disqualified from contracting by any law to which he is subject."

**Who is a Minor:**
Under Indian Majority Act, 1875:
- Person below 18 years is minor
- If guardian appointed: minority until 21 years

#### "Minor's Agreement is Void" - Mohori Bibee Case

**Mohori Bibee v. Dharmodas Ghose (1903) - Privy Council**

**Facts:**
- Dharmodas Ghose (minor) mortgaged property to Brahmo Dutt (money lender)
- Money lender's attorney knew Dharmodas was minor
- Minor's mother filed suit to set aside mortgage
- Money lender claimed minor should return money under Sections 64 or 65

**Held by Privy Council:**
1. Minor's agreement is **VOID AB INITIO** (void from beginning), not voidable
2. Section 11 makes minors incompetent to contract
3. Definition of "void agreement" in Section 2(g) includes minor's agreements
4. Even if minor falsely represented himself as major, contract remains void
5. Section 64 (restitution on rescission) doesn't apply - no valid contract to rescind
6. Section 65 (obligation to restore benefits) doesn't apply to void agreements
7. Minor need not return money obtained

**Significance:**
- Established that minor's agreements are absolutely void in India
- Provides absolute protection to minors
- Different from English law where minor's contracts are voidable

#### Rules Regarding Minor's Agreements

**1. Void Ab Initio**
- Void from very beginning
- Not voidable at minor's option
- Never creates legal obligations

**2. No Estoppel Against Minor**
Even if minor fraudulently represents himself as major, contract remains void.

**Case Law: Sadiq Ali Khan v. Jai Kishori (1928)**
Minor obtained loan by fraud (misrepresenting age). Contract void. However, specific property (if identifiable and in minor's possession) can be recovered.

**3. No Ratification on Attaining Majority**
Void contract cannot become valid by ratification after majority.

**Case Law: Suraj Narain Dube v. Sukhu Aheer (1929)**
Minor executed promissory note. After majority, executed fresh note. Held: Fresh promise without consideration not enforceable.

**4. Minor's Property Not Liable**
Generally, minor's property cannot be made liable for contract obligations.

**5. No Specific Performance**
Court won't grant specific performance of minor's agreement.

**6. Minor Cannot Be Adjudged Insolvent**
Cannot contract debts, hence cannot be insolvent.

**7. Can Be Beneficiary**
Minor can receive benefits under contracts between adults.

**8. Can Be Agent but Not Liable**
Section 184: Minor can act as agent but not personally liable.

**9. Cannot Be Partner**
But can be admitted to benefits of partnership (Partnership Act, Section 30).

#### Exception: Necessaries (Section 68)

**Section 68 states:**
"If a person, incapable of entering into a contract, or any one whom he is legally bound to support, is supplied by another person with necessaries suited to his condition in life, the person who has furnished such supplies is entitled to be reimbursed from the property of such incapable person."

**Key Points:**

**1. What are Necessaries:**
- Goods/services essential for existence
- Suitable to minor's condition in life
- Food, clothing, shelter, education, medical treatment, marriage expenses (in India)

**2. Liability:**
- Minor NOT personally liable
- Minor's PROPERTY liable
- Reasonable price, not contracted price

**3. Burden of Proof:**
On supplier to prove goods were necessaries and not already adequately supplied.

**Case Law: Nash v. Inman (1908)**
**Facts:** Tailor supplied 11 fancy waistcoats to Cambridge undergraduate (minor).
**Held:** Not necessaries as student already adequately supplied with clothing. Cannot recover.

**Case Law: Chapple v. Cooper (1844)**
**Facts:** Minor widow ordered funeral for deceased husband.
**Held:** Funeral expenses are necessaries. Minor's estate liable.

**Rationale:** Exception ensures minors can obtain essential goods/services while protecting them from exploitation.

#### Comparison: India vs. England

| **Aspect** | **India** | **England** |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Nature** | Void ab initio | Some voidable, some void |
| **Ratification** | Not possible | Possible for voidable contracts |
| **Necessaries** | Property liable only | Personal liability possible |
| **Fraud** | No estoppel | Restitution may be ordered |

#### Protection to Other Party

**Limited Protection Available:**

**1. Restitution of Specific Property:**
If property obtained by fraud, still identifiable and in minor's possession, may be recovered.

**2. No Personal Liability:**
Cannot sue minor personally even for fraud.

**3. Tort Liability:**
Minor liable for torts, but action in tort cannot indirectly enforce void contract.

**Case Law: Leslie v. Sheill (1914)**
Action in deceit (tort) not allowed as it would indirectly enforce void contract.

#### Conclusion

The principle that "minor's agreement is void" as established in Mohori Bibee case provides absolute protection to minors from exploitation. While this may seem harsh on adults dealing with minors, law prioritizes protection of those lacking full contractual capacity. The only exception is Section 68 (necessaries), where minor's property (not person) is liable, ensuring minors can obtain essential goods and services. This balance protects minors while allowing them to meet basic needs. Understanding this principle is crucial in commercial transactions to ensure contracts are with competent parties and therefore enforceable.

## Q6) Define consideration. Explain essentials of valid consideration.

### MODEL ANSWER:

[This is comprehensively covered in 10_Marks/Consideration.md - providing complete answer]

#### Introduction

Consideration is one of the essential elements for the validity of a contract under Section 10 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. It represents the quid pro quo (something in return) - the price paid by one party for the promise of the other. The maxim "Ex nudo pacto non oritur actio" (no action arises from a naked contract without consideration) embodies this principle.

#### Definition of Consideration - Section 2(d)

**Section 2(d) states:**
"When, at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains from doing, or promises to do or to abstain from doing, something, such act or abstinence or promise is called a consideration for the promise."

**Simple Meaning:**
Consideration is something of value given by one party in exchange for the promise or performance of another party.

**Popular Definitions:**

**Sir Frederick Pollock:**
"An act or forbearance of one party, or the promise thereof, is the price for which the promise of the other is bought."

**Lush J:**
"A valuable consideration in the sense of law may consist either in some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other."

#### Essentials of Valid Consideration

### 1. Consideration Must Move at the Desire of the Promisor

The act or forbearance must be done at the desire, request, or requirement of the promisor, not voluntarily or at the instance of a third party.

**Case Law: Durga Prasad v. Baldeo (1880)**
**Facts:** D constructed shops on land belonging to B at the desire of Collector (not B). B promised to pay commission. Later B refused.
**Held:** No consideration as construction was not done at B's desire but at Collector's request. Promise not enforceable.

**Case Law: Kedar Nath v. Gorie Mohamed (1886)**
**Facts:** K built shops on his own land at the request of G to increase land value. G promised commission on sales.
**Held:** Valid consideration as work was done at G's desire. Promise enforceable.

**Key Point:** Voluntarily doing something without promisor's request doesn't constitute consideration.

### 2. Consideration May Move from the Promisee or Any Other Person

Unlike English law, Indian law allows consideration to move from any person, not necessarily the promisee.

**Section 2(d) explicitly states:** "the promisee or any other person"

**Case Law: Chinnaya v. Ramayya (1882) - Leading Case**
**Facts:**
- Old lady (A) gifted property to daughter (B)
- B promised to pay annuity to A's sister (C)
- B failed to pay
- C sued B

**Held:** C can sue even though she was not party to contract and gave no consideration. Consideration (property) moved from A (the old lady), but C (beneficiary) can enforce promise.

**Significance:** Establishes doctrine "Consideration from third party is valid in India."

**English Law:** Consideration must move from promisee. Stranger to consideration cannot sue.

### 3. Consideration May Be Past, Present, or Future

**Past Consideration:**
Something already done before promise is made.

**Indian Law:** Valid (Section 2(d) uses past tense "has done")
**English Law:** Generally invalid

**Example:** A saves B's property from fire. Later B promises to pay ₹50,000. Valid in India.

**Case Law: Sindha Shri Ganpatsinghji v. Abraham (1895)**
S helped A save property from auction. Later A promised to repay. Held: Valid consideration for past voluntary service (Section 25(2)).

**Present Consideration (Executed):**
Given simultaneously with promise.

**Example:** A pays ₹1,000 and B hands over book immediately. Both present consideration.

**Future Consideration (Executory):**
Promise to be performed in future.

**Example:** A promises to deliver goods next month. B promises to pay on delivery. Both future considerations.

### 4. Consideration Must Be Real, Not Illusory

Consideration must have some value in eyes of law, but need not be adequate.

**Real Consideration:** Has actual value
**Illusory Consideration:** Appears as consideration but has no real value

**Example of Illusory:**
"I will pay if I feel like it" - Not binding consideration.

**Case Law: Thomas v. Thomas (1842)**
**Facts:** House let for £1 per year, actual rent much higher.
**Held:** £1 is sufficient consideration though not adequate.

### 5. Consideration Must Be Lawful

Must not be illegal, immoral, or opposed to public policy (Section 23).

**Example:** A promises to pay B for committing theft. Illegal consideration - void.

### 6. Consideration Need Not Be Adequate But Must Be Sufficient

**Adequate:** Equal in value
**Sufficient:** Having some value in law

**Principle:** Courts don't assess adequacy (parties' freedom to contract) but ensure sufficiency (legal value).

**Case Law: Chappell & Co. v. Nestle (1960)**
**Facts:** Records sold for money plus three chocolate wrappers (which were thrown away).
**Held:** Wrappers part of consideration despite negligible value. Need not be adequate.

**Inadequacy May Evidence:**
- Fraud
- Undue influence
- Coercion
- Unconscionable bargain

But adequacy itself not required.

### 7. Consideration Must Not Be Impossible

Promise to do impossible thing is not valid consideration.

**Example:** Promise to touch the sun - not valid consideration.

### 8. Forbearance as Consideration

Refraining from doing something one has legal right to do is valid consideration.

**Example:**
- Forbearance to sue
- Not exercising legal right

**Case Law: Mohori Bibee v. Dharmodas Ghose (1903)**
Money lender abstaining from suing. Forbearance to sue can be valid consideration (though case involved minor, so contract void on that ground).

#### Summary of Essentials

| **Essential** | **Requirement** | **If Absent** |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **At promisor's desire** | Must be at request | Not consideration |
| **From any person** | Promisee or third party | Valid if from anyone |
| **Past/Present/Future** | Any time is valid | All three valid in India |
| **Real** | Must have value | If illusory, not valid |
| **Lawful** | Must be legal | If illegal, void |
| **Sufficient** | Some value in law | If insufficient, void |
| **Possible** | Must be possible | If impossible, void |

#### Exceptions: When Consideration Not Required (Section 25)

Though consideration generally essential, three exceptions under Section 25:

**1. Natural Love and Affection:**
- Written and registered
- Between near relations
- On account of natural love

**2. Past Voluntary Services:**
- Services rendered voluntarily
- Promise to compensate

**3. Time-Barred Debt:**
- Written promise
- To pay debt barred by limitation

**Other Exceptions:**
- Completed gift
- Agency (Section 185)
- Remission/extension (Section 63)

#### Practical Examples

**Example 1: Valid Consideration**
A agrees to paint B's house for ₹50,000. B agrees to pay.
- A's consideration: Service of painting
- B's consideration: Payment of ₹50,000
- Both valid, real, lawful, at each other's desire

**Example 2: Invalid - Not at Desire**
A voluntarily repairs B's fence. Later asks B to pay. B refuses.
- A's act not at B's desire
- No consideration
- B not liable

**Example 3: Valid - Past Consideration (India)**
A finds B's lost dog and returns it. B promises ₹5,000 reward.
- Past consideration (finding already done)
- Valid in India (Section 2(d))
- B must pay

**Example 4: Invalid - Illusory**
A promises to pay B "if I feel like it."
- Illusory consideration
- A's discretion makes it unenforceable
- Not binding

#### Conclusion

Consideration is the backbone of a valid contract, representing the bargain element that distinguishes enforceable contracts from mere gratuitous promises. The essentials ensure that consideration is genuine, voluntary (at promisor's desire), lawful, real, and sufficient (though not necessarily adequate). Indian law's liberal approach - allowing consideration to move from third parties and recognizing past consideration - makes it more flexible than English law. While courts don't assess adequacy (respecting freedom of contract), they ensure sufficiency (legal value). Understanding these essentials is crucial for determining whether an agreement has the reciprocity necessary to be enforced by law, protecting parties from one-sided arrangements while respecting their freedom to determine their own bargains.

## Q7) Discuss in brief Agreements expressly declared to be void under Indian Contract Act, 1872.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Introduction

The Indian Contract Act, 1872 expressly declares certain types of agreements as void under Sections 26 to 30. These agreements, even if made with free consent of competent parties, cannot be enforced because they are contrary to public policy or lack essential elements of a valid contract.

#### Agreements Expressly Declared Void

### 1. Agreement in Restraint of Marriage - Section 26

**Section 26:** "Every agreement in restraint of the marriage of any person, other than a minor, is void."

**Meaning:** Agreement preventing or restraining any person from marrying is void.

**Rationale:**
- Freedom to marry is fundamental right
- Public policy favors marriage
- Marriage is social institution

**Example:** A agrees not to marry anyone for ₹10 lakhs. Void.

**Exception:** Restraint of minor's marriage may be valid (for minor's protection).

**Possible Valid:** Agreement restraining marriage to particular person (if reasonable).

### 2. Agreement in Restraint of Trade - Section 27

**Section 27:** "Every agreement by which any one is restrained from exercising a lawful profession, trade or business of any kind, is to that extent void."

**Rationale:**
- Protects freedom of trade (Article 19(1)(g))
- Promotes competition
- Prevents monopolies

**Nature:** ABSOLUTE prohibition in India (no reasonableness doctrine).

**Case Law: Niranjan Shankar v. Century Spinning (1967)**
Non-compete clause in employment contract even after termination - void. Section 27 absolute.

**Three Exceptions:**

**(a) Sale of Goodwill [Proviso 1]:**
Seller may agree not to carry on similar business within specified local limits.

**(b) Partnership - During [Proviso 2]:**
Partners may agree not to carry similar business while partnership continues.

**(c) Partnership - After Dissolution [Proviso 3]:**
Partners may agree restraint for specified period/area after dissolution.

### 3. Agreement in Restraint of Legal Proceedings - Section 28

**Section 28:** "Every agreement, by which any party thereto is restricted absolutely from enforcing his rights under or in respect of any contract, by the usual legal proceedings in the ordinary tribunals, or which limits the time within which he may thus enforce his rights, is void to that extent."

**What is Void:**
- Absolute restriction on right to sue
- Shortening limitation period

**What is Valid:**
- Arbitration agreements (proviso)
- Extending limitation period
- Conditional/reasonable restrictions

**Case Law: Nath v. Radha Kishan (1941)**
Agreement ousting court jurisdiction for all disputes - void.

**Exception:** Arbitration agreements for existing or future disputes - valid under Arbitration Act.

### 4. Agreements with Uncertain Meaning - Section 29

**Section 29:** "Agreements, the meaning of which is not certain, or capable of being made certain, are void."

**Principle:** Courts cannot enforce vague agreements.

**Case Law: Guthing v. Lynn (1831)**
Promise to pay more if horse proves "lucky" - void for uncertainty.

**Case Law: Scammel v. Ouston (1941)**
"On hire-purchase terms" without specifying - void.

**Valid if Meaning Can Be Made Certain:**
- By trade usage
- Reference to external standards
- Previous dealings

**Case Law: Hillas v. Arcos (1932)**
"Fair specification" of timber - not void, can be determined by trade practice.

### 5. Agreements by Way of Wager - Section 30

**Section 30:** "Agreements by way of wager are void; and no suit shall be brought for recovering anything alleged to be won on any wager, or entrusted to any person to abide by the result of any game or other uncertain event on which any wager is made."

**Essentials of Wager:**
1. Mutual promises to pay
2. Uncertain future event
3. Opposite views about event
4. No interest except stake (most important)
5. Event beyond parties' control

**Example:** A and B bet ₹10,000 on cricket match - void.

**Exception:** Horse racing bets for prize ₹500+ exempted.

**Case Law: Dr. KR Lakshmanan (1996)**
Horse racing is game of skill. Betting on horse races permissible under exception.

**Distinctions:**

**Wager vs. Insurance:**
Insurance has insurable interest; wager doesn't.

**Wager vs. Speculation:**
Genuine business transactions with intention to perform are valid; pure betting is void.

**Case Law: Gherulal Parakh v. Mahadeodas (1959)**
Forward contracts with intention to perform - valid speculation, not wager.

#### Comparison Table

| **Section** | **Type** | **Rationale** | **Exceptions** |
|-------------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **26** | Restraint of marriage | Freedom to marry | Minor's marriage |
| **27** | Restraint of trade | Freedom of profession | Goodwill, partnership |
| **28** | Restraint of legal proceedings | Access to justice | Arbitration |
| **29** | Uncertain meaning | Certainty needed | Can be made certain |
| **30** | Wagering | Against gambling | Horse racing |

#### Other Related Void Agreements

Though not under Sections 26-30, other agreements declared void:

**1. Agreement Without Consideration (Section 25)**
General rule, with three exceptions.

**2. Agreements with Unlawful Object/Consideration (Sections 23-24)**
Forbidden by law, immoral, opposed to public policy, etc.

**3. Agreements with Incompetent Persons (Sections 11-12)**
Minors, persons of unsound mind, disqualified persons.

**4. Agreements Contingent on Impossible Events (Section 36)**
If event impossible from beginning.

#### Effect of Void Agreement

**Consequences:**
1. Not enforceable by law
2. Creates no legal rights or obligations
3. Cannot be ratified
4. Money paid may be recoverable (Section 65)
5. Collateral agreements may be valid (unless illegal)

#### Conclusion

The Indian Contract Act expressly declares certain agreements void (Sections 26-30) to protect public interest and ensure contracts meet minimum standards of legality, certainty, and fairness. Restraints on marriage, trade, and legal proceedings are void to protect fundamental freedoms. Uncertain agreements and wagers are void for lack of definiteness and opposition to public policy. These provisions ensure that only genuine, clear, and lawful agreements receive legal sanction, balancing individual freedom with societal interests. Understanding these void agreements is crucial for drafting valid contracts and avoiding unenforceable arrangements.

## Q8) Define free consent. When the consent is said to be caused by fraud.

### MODEL ANSWER:

[Covered in 10_Marks/Free_Consent.md - providing complete answer]

#### Introduction

Free consent is an essential element of a valid contract under Section 10 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. For an agreement to be enforceable, the parties must give their consent freely, without any external pressure, misrepresentation, or error. Consent obtained by fraud vitiates the contract, making it voidable at the option of the aggrieved party.

#### Definition of Free Consent

**Section 13 - Consent:**
"Two or more persons are said to consent when they agree upon the same thing in the same sense."

**Meaning:** Consensus ad idem (meeting of minds) - parties must understand and agree on same terms.

**Section 14 - Free Consent:**
"Consent is said to be free when it is not caused by—
1. coercion, as defined in section 15, or
2. undue influence, as defined in section 16, or
3. fraud, as defined in section 17, or
4. misrepresentation, as defined in section 18, or
5. mistake, subject to the provisions of sections 20, 21 and 22."

**Meaning:** Consent given voluntarily, with full knowledge and understanding, without external pressure or deception.

#### When Consent is Caused by Fraud - Section 17

**Section 17 defines fraud as:**
"Fraud means and includes any of the following acts committed by a party to a contract, or with his connivance, or by his agent, with intent to deceive another party thereto or his agent, or to induce him to enter into the contract:—

(1) the suggestion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who does not believe it to be true;

(2) the active concealment of a fact by one having knowledge or belief of the fact;

(3) a promise made without any intention of performing it;

(4) any other act fitted to deceive;

(5) any such act or omission as the law specially declares to be fraudulent."

**Explanation:** Mere silence as to facts likely to affect the willingness of a person to enter into a contract is not fraud, unless the circumstances of the case are such that, regard being had to them, it is the duty of the person keeping silence to speak, or unless his silence is, in itself, equivalent to speech.

#### Elements of Fraud

### 1. Suggestion as Fact of that Which is Not True (Section 17(1))

**Requirements:**
- Statement must be of fact (not opinion or law)
- Statement must be false
- Person making statement must not believe it to be true

**Example:** A sells car to B stating "This car has done only 10,000 km" when actually it has done 50,000 km, and A knows this. This is fraud.

**Not Fraud:**
- Mere puffery or exaggeration in trade
- Opinion honestly held (not fraud, may be misrepresentation)

**Case Law: Derry v. Peek (1889)**
Directors issued prospectus stating company authorized to use steam power. They honestly believed this (though wrong). Held: Not fraud (no knowledge of falsity). May be misrepresentation.

### 2. Active Concealment of Fact (Section 17(2))

**Requirements:**
- Material fact concealed
- Person has knowledge or belief of fact
- Active concealment (not mere silence)

**Example:** A sells house to B. A knows foundation is defective but covers it up and doesn't disclose. This is fraud.

**Active vs. Passive:**
- **Active concealment:** Taking steps to hide fact (fraud)
- **Mere silence:** Not disclosing (generally not fraud, see Explanation)

**Case Law: Horsfall v. Thomas (1862)**
Seller of gun concealed defect by plugging up hole. Buyer didn't examine gun. Held: Active concealment is fraud.

### 3. Promise Without Intention to Perform (Section 17(3))

**Requirements:**
- Promise made
- At time of promise, no intention to perform
- Intent to deceive

**Example:** A borrows ₹5 lakhs from B promising to repay in 6 months, but at time of borrowing A has no intention to repay. Fraud.

**Distinguished from Breach:**
- **Fraud:** No intention to perform at time of promise
- **Breach:** Intention existed but later unable/unwilling to perform

### 4. Any Other Act Fitted to Deceive (Section 17(4))

**Meaning:** Any act calculated or likely to deceive, even if not specifically mentioned in clauses (1), (2), or (3).

**Examples:**
- Rigging bids at auction
- Creating false market for shares
- Disguising identity to obtain contract

**Broad Clause:** Catches deceptive acts not covered by specific clauses.

### 5. Acts Specially Declared Fraudulent by Law (Section 17(5))

**Meaning:** Any act that specific law declares fraudulent.

**Examples:**
- Fraudulent preference under Insolvency Act
- Fraudulent trading under Companies Act
- Misrepresentation in prospectus

#### Explanation to Section 17 - Silence

**General Rule:** Mere silence (not disclosing facts) is NOT fraud.

**Exceptions - Silence IS Fraud When:**

**(a) Duty to Speak:**
Certain relationships impose duty to disclose.

**Examples:**
- Insurance contracts (uberrimae fidei - utmost good faith)
- Fiduciary relationships (trustee-beneficiary, director-company)
- Family arrangements

**Case Law: Life Insurance Corporation v. Suresh Chandra (1970)**
In insurance, duty to disclose all material facts. Non-disclosure is fraud.

**(b) Silence Equivalent to Speech:**
Half-truth that misleads.

**Example:** A selling horse says "Horse won many races" (true) but doesn't mention horse recently injured and cannot race anymore. Silence here is fraud.

**(c) Changed Circumstances:**
If representation true when made but circumstances change before contract, must disclose change.

**Example:** A offers to buy B's property. B's property value increases due to new development. Before acceptance, must inform A.

#### Effect of Fraud - Section 19

**Section 19:** "When consent to an agreement is caused by coercion, fraud or misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the party whose consent was so caused."

**Party Can:**
1. **Rescind contract** - Treat it as void
2. **Affirm contract** - Insist on performance
3. **Claim damages** - For loss suffered

**Key Point:** Contract is VOIDABLE (not void). Choice lies with defrauded party.

**Additional Remedy for Fraud:**
Unlike mere misrepresentation, defrauded party can claim damages for any loss suffered (Section 19).

#### Fraud by Third Party - Section 19

If fraud committed by third party (not party to contract):
- Contract voidable if party to contract had knowledge of fraud
- If party to contract had no knowledge, contract not voidable

**Example:** A sells goods to B. C (third party) tells B falsely that goods are of superior quality. If A knew of C's fraud, B can avoid contract. If A didn't know, B cannot avoid.

#### Distinction: Fraud vs. Misrepresentation

| **Fraud (Section 17)** | **Misrepresentation (Section 18)** |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| False statement knowingly | False statement innocently |
| Intent to deceive | No intent to deceive |
| Knowledge of falsity | Belief in truth |
| Moral wrong | No moral wrong |
| Remedy: Rescission + Damages | Remedy: Rescission only |

#### Bars to Rescission - Section 19A

Cannot rescind if:
1. **Restitution impossible** - Parties cannot be restored
2. **Third party rights** - Bona fide purchasers for value acquired rights
3. **Affirmation** - Party affirmed contract after discovering fraud
4. **Undue delay** - Unreasonable delay in seeking rescission

#### Illustration from Section 17

**Illustration (a):**
A, having first obtained employment with B by concealing his misconduct at his former employment, later discloses his misconduct. Can B dismiss A?
Answer: No. The representation was true when A entered employment. Subsequent disclosure doesn't affect past contract.

**Illustration (b):**
A says to B, "My estate is free from encumbrance." This is false, and A knows it. This is fraud.

#### Practical Examples

**Example 1: False Statement**
A sells painting to B claiming it's original Hussain. A knows it's fake. Fraud by false statement.

**Example 2: Active Concealment**
A sells car to B after accident. A repairs car but doesn't disclose accident. Active concealment - fraud.

**Example 3: Promise Without Intent**
A takes advance from B for construction, having no intention to complete work. Fraud.

**Example 4: Silence as Fraud**
A takes life insurance without disclosing heart disease (material fact). In insurance, duty to disclose - silence is fraud.

**Example 5: Half-Truth**
A selling property says "Property earns ₹10,000/month rent" (true last year) but doesn't mention tenant left and property now vacant. Half-truth - fraud.

#### Conclusion

Free consent under Section 14 requires consent free from coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation, and mistake. Fraud under Section 17 involves false statements knowingly made, active concealment, promises without intention to perform, or any act fitted to deceive. While mere silence generally isn't fraud, exceptions exist when there's duty to speak or silence is equivalent to speech. Fraud makes contract voidable at defrauded party's option, who can rescind contract and claim damages. Unlike misrepresentation (innocent false statement), fraud involves intentional deception and provides remedy of damages in addition to rescission. Understanding fraud is crucial for protecting parties from deceptive practices and ensuring consent is genuine, informed, and voluntary in contractual relationships.

## Q9) Write a detail note on Rescission of contract.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Introduction

Rescission is a remedy available when a contract is voidable due to vitiating factors such as fraud, misrepresentation, coercion, or undue influence, or when both parties mutually agree to cancel the contract. It involves canceling or annulling the contract, with the objective of restoring parties to their original positions as if the contract never existed.

#### Meaning of Rescission

**Rescission:** Cancellation or annulment of contract, putting an end to it as if it never existed.

**Effect:** Contract becomes void. Parties freed from obligations and must restore benefits received.

**Types of Rescission:**

**1. Rescission by Agreement (Mutual):**
Both parties agree to cancel contract.

**2. Rescission for Breach:**
Innocent party rescinds due to other party's breach.

**3. Rescission for Vitiating Factors:**
Party whose consent vitiated (fraud, coercion, etc.) rescinds contract.

#### Legal Provisions

**Section 19 - When Consent Vitiated:**
"When consent to an agreement is caused by coercion, fraud or misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the party whose consent was so caused."

**Section 64 - Consequences of Rescission:**
"When a person at whose option a contract is voidable rescinds it, the other party thereto need not perform any promise therein contained in which he is promisor. The party rescinding a voidable contract shall, if he has received any benefit thereunder from another party to such contract, restore such benefit, so far as may be, to the person from whom it was received."

**Section 65 - Obligation to Restore Benefits:**
"When an agreement is discovered to be void, or when a contract becomes void, any person who has received any advantage under such agreement or contract is bound to restore it, or to make compensation for it to the person from whom he received it."

#### Grounds for Rescission

**1. Coercion (Section 15):**
Consent obtained by threats or force.

**2. Undue Influence (Section 16):**
Using position to dominate will of another.

**3. Fraud (Section 17):**
Intentional false representation to deceive.

**4. Misrepresentation (Section 18):**
Innocent false statement of fact.

**5. Mutual Mistake (Section 20):**
Both parties mistaken about essential fact.

**6. Breach of Contract:**
Material breach by one party.

**7. Mutual Agreement:**
Both parties agree to cancel.

#### Procedure for Rescission

**1. Notice to Other Party:**
Party rescinding must communicate decision to other party.

**2. Return of Benefits:**
Must restore any benefit received under contract.

**3. File Suit if Necessary:**
If other party doesn't cooperate, may file suit for rescission.

**4. Court's Role:**
Court may:
- Grant rescission
- Order restoration of benefits
- Award compensation if restoration impossible

#### Effects of Rescission

**1. Contract Becomes Void:**
All obligations under contract cease.

**2. Parties Freed:**
Neither party bound to perform.

**3. Restitution Required (Section 64):**
Party rescinding must restore benefits received.

**4. Compensation if Restoration Impossible:**
If benefit cannot be restored in kind, must compensate.

**5. Other Party's Obligations Cease:**
Other party need not perform promises.

#### Bars to Rescission - Section 19A

**Section 19A:** "A contract which is voidable on account of coercion, fraud or misrepresentation may be expressly or impliedly ratified, either before or after the institution of any proceeding for the rescission of such contract. A contract which has been ratified cannot afterwards be rescinded."

**Cannot Rescind If:**

**1. Restitution Impossible:**
Parties cannot be restored to original position.

**Example:** Goods consumed, destroyed, or substantially altered.

**2. Third Party Rights:**
Bona fide purchaser for value acquired rights in subject matter.

**Example:** A sells car to B by fraud. B sells to C (innocent buyer). A cannot rescind against C.

**3. Affirmation:**
Party has affirmed contract after discovering vitiating factor.

**Example:** After discovering fraud, party continues to perform contract. Treated as affirmation.

**Affirmation may be:**
- **Express:** Explicitly stating intention to continue
- **Implied:** Conduct showing acceptance (delay, taking benefits, etc.)

**4. Undue Delay:**
Unreasonable delay in exercising right to rescind.

**Principle:** Law helps vigilant, not those who sleep on their rights.

**Case Law: Prem Raj v. Phool Bai**
Party who delays unreasonably loses right to rescind.

#### Rescission vs. Other Remedies

**Rescission vs. Damages:**
- **Rescission:** Cancel contract, restore position
- **Damages:** Keep contract, claim compensation

**Rescission vs. Specific Performance:**
- **Rescission:** Don't want contract performed
- **Specific Performance:** Want contract performed

**Rescission vs. Novation:**
- **Rescission:** Cancel existing contract
- **Novation:** Replace existing contract with new one

#### Rescission by Agreement (Mutual Rescission)

**When:** Both parties mutually agree to cancel contract.

**Requirements:**
1. Mutual consent
2. Consideration (each party's release is consideration for other's)
3. Intention to rescind

**Effect:** Contract discharged. Parties freed from obligations.

**Example:** A contracts to sell land to B. Both later agree to cancel contract. Valid mutual rescission.

#### Rescission for Breach

**When Material Breach:**
Innocent party can treat contract as repudiated and rescind.

**Material Breach:** Substantial breach going to root of contract.

**Example:** A agrees to supply 1000 kg rice. Supplies only 100 kg. B can rescind for material breach.

#### Partial Rescission

**Court's Discretion (Especially in Undue Influence):**
Court may:
- Set aside entire contract, OR
- Modify terms to make fair, OR
- Direct return of excessive benefit

**Example:** Money lender obtains promissory note for ₹10 lakhs by undue influence when actual loan was ₹5 lakhs. Court may reduce note to ₹5 lakhs plus reasonable interest instead of rescinding entirely.

#### Time Limit for Rescission

**Limitation Act, 1963:**
- Generally 3 years from when right to rescind arises
- For fraud: 3 years from when fraud discovered

**Principle:** Must act promptly. Delay may bar relief.

#### Rescission in Specific Contexts

**1. Sale of Goods:**
Buyer may rescind for breach of condition (Section 11, Sale of Goods Act).

**2. Insurance:**
Insurer may rescind for material misrepresentation or non-disclosure.

**3. Partnership:**
Partner may seek rescission for fraud in inducing partnership.

**4. Marriage:**
Voidable marriage may be annulled (rescission equivalent).

#### Practical Examples

**Example 1: Fraud**
A sells car to B misrepresenting mileage. B discovers fraud within month.
- B can rescind contract
- Must return car
- Can claim refund of price
- Can also claim damages for fraud

**Example 2: Coercion**
A threatens B's family. B transfers property under threat.
- B can rescind transfer
- Must be done promptly after coercion ceases
- If B delays years, may lose right

**Example 3: Third Party Rights**
A sells goods to B by fraud. B sells to C (innocent buyer). A discovers fraud.
- A can rescind against B
- But cannot recover goods from C (innocent third party)
- Can claim damages from B

**Example 4: Affirmation**
A buys shares based on B's misrepresentation. After discovering misrepresentation, A receives dividends for 2 years.
- A's conduct shows affirmation
- Cannot later rescind
- Right lost by delay and acceptance of benefits

#### Conclusion

Rescission is an important equitable remedy that allows cancellation of contracts vitiated by fraud, coercion, undue influence, or misrepresentation, or contracts that parties mutually wish to terminate. It aims to restore parties to positions before contract, ensuring justice when consent was not freely given. However, the right to rescind is subject to important bars - impossibility of restitution, third party rights, affirmation, and undue delay - which balance the need for contractual certainty with protection of the deceived party. Understanding rescission is crucial for parties seeking to exit contracts obtained through improper means while respecting rights of innocent third parties and the principle that parties must act promptly to protect their rights. The remedy ensures contracts are based on genuine consent while maintaining stability in commercial transactions.

## PART- C [Answer any TWO] [2 × 5 = 10 Marks]

---

## Q10) Write short note on (any Two)

### a) Novation

#### Answer:

**Meaning:**
Novation is the substitution of a new contract for an existing contract, either between the same parties or between different parties. The consideration for new contract is discharge of old contract.

**Essential Elements:**

**1. Existing Valid Contract:**
There must be existing valid contract to be substituted.

**2. New Contract:**
New contract must be created.

**3. Mutual Consent:**
All parties must consent to substitution.

**4. Consideration:**
Discharge of old contract is consideration for new contract.

**5. Same Parties or Different Parties:**
- **Same parties:** New terms between A and B
- **Different parties:** C substituted for A in contract with B

**Types:**

**1. Change of Parties:**
New party substituted for original party.

**Example:** A owes ₹10,000 to B. C agrees to pay B if B releases A. With B's consent, A discharged and C becomes debtor. This is novation.

**2. Change of Terms:**
Material change in terms between same parties.

**Example:** A owes ₹10,000 to B payable on 1st January. They agree to change amount to ₹8,000 payable on 1st March. Old contract discharged, new contract created.

**Effect:**

**1. Old Contract Discharged:**
Original contract ceases to exist.

**2. New Contract Binding:**
New contract becomes enforceable.

**3. Rights and Obligations Change:**
Parties bound by new terms.

**Section 62:**
Novation is a mode of discharge of contract by substitution.

**Distinction - Novation vs. Alteration:**
- **Novation:** Requires consent of all parties
- **Alteration:** Unilateral change may discharge contract

**Example:** A, B, and C are partners. They admit D as partner and release A from liabilities. This is novation - new partnership contract replaces old one.

---

### b) Anticipatory Breach of Contract

#### Answer:

**Meaning:**
Anticipatory breach occurs when a party to contract, before the time for performance, expresses intention not to perform his obligations or makes performance impossible by his own act.

**Also Called:** Repudiation before performance.

**Section 39 (Sale of Goods Act):**
Recognizes anticipatory breach where party repudiates contract before due date.

**Two Types:**

**1. Express Repudiation:**
Party expressly states he will not perform.

**Example:** A contracts to sell goods to B on 15th January. On 1st January, A informs B he will not supply goods. Express anticipatory breach.

**2. Implied Repudiation:**
Party makes performance impossible by his own act.

**Example:** A contracts to sell specific land to B. Before completion date, A sells same land to C. Implied anticipatory breach.

**Rights of Innocent Party:**

**1. Immediate Action:**
Can treat contract as repudiated immediately and sue for breach without waiting for performance date.

**2. Wait for Performance Date:**
Can wait until performance date and then sue if breach continues.

**3. Claim Damages:**
Entitled to claim damages for loss suffered.

**Leading Case Law: Frost v. Knight (1872)**

**Facts:**
- Defendant promised to marry plaintiff after his father's death
- During father's lifetime, defendant married another woman
- Plaintiff sued immediately

**Held:**
- Plaintiff could sue immediately
- Need not wait for father's death
- Defendant's action made future performance impossible

**Indian Case: Karnail Singh v. Bhatia General Supplies (1977)**
Contract for supply of machines. Supplier sold machines to another before delivery date. Purchaser could immediately sue for anticipatory breach.

**Advantages of Immediate Action:**

**1. Prompt Remedy:**
Don't have to wait for performance date.

**2. Mitigation:**
Can make alternate arrangements immediately.

**3. Certainty:**
Resolves situation quickly.

**Measure of Damages:**
Damages assessed as of breach date, not original performance date.

**Principle:** Innocent party must take reasonable steps to mitigate loss. Cannot wait indefinitely while loss accumulates.

**Example:**
A contracts to supply goods on 30th December at ₹100/unit. On 1st December, A repudiates. Market price on 1st December is ₹110/unit. B can buy from market immediately at ₹110 and claim ₹10/unit difference from A.

---

### c) Perpetual Injunction

#### Answer:

**Meaning:**
Perpetual (permanent) injunction is a final order of court granted at end of trial, permanently restraining a party from asserting a right or from doing a particular act.

**Legal Basis:** Specific Relief Act, 1963 (Sections 37-42)

**Section 38:**
"Perpetual injunction can only be granted by the decree made at the hearing and upon the merits of the suit; the defendant is thereby perpetually enjoined from the assertion of a right, or from the commission of an act, which would be contrary to the rights of the plaintiff."

**Nature:**
- **Final remedy:** Granted after full trial
- **Permanent:** Continues indefinitely
- **Preventive:** Prevents future wrong

**Types:**

**1. Prohibitory Injunction:**
Restrains doing something.

**Example:** Court orders A not to play loud music after 10 PM.

**2. Mandatory Injunction:**
Requires positive action to undo wrong.

**Example:** Court orders A to remove encroachment from B's land.

**When Granted:**

**Section 38 Requirements:**

**1. Right to Property:**
Plaintiff has legal right in property.

**2. Breach or Threat:**
Defendant breaching or threatening plaintiff's right.

**3. Damages Inadequate:**
Monetary compensation insufficient remedy.

**4. No Alternative Remedy:**
No other equally efficacious remedy.

**When NOT Granted (Section 41):**

1. Breach of contract of personal service
2. Contract determinable in nature
3. Contract has not been partly performed by plaintiff
4. Conduct of plaintiff disentitles him
5. Multiplicity of proceedings would result

**Contract Law Application:**
In contracts, perpetual injunction may be granted to enforce negative covenants.

**Example:** A agrees to sell land to B and not to sell to anyone else. A tries to sell to C. B can get perpetual injunction restraining A from selling to C.

**Case Law: Lumley v. Wagner (1852)**
Opera singer agreed to sing at plaintiff's theater and not at any other. Court granted injunction restraining her from singing elsewhere (negative covenant).

**Note:** Court won't grant injunction that amounts to specific performance of personal service contract.

**Distinction - Temporary vs. Perpetual:**

| **Temporary Injunction** | **Perpetual Injunction** |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Interim relief | Final relief |
| During pendency of suit | After trial |
| Temporary in nature | Permanent |
| Maintain status quo | Final determination of rights |

**Procedure:**
1. File suit with prayer for perpetual injunction
2. May seek temporary injunction pending trial
3. Full trial on merits
4. If plaintiff proves case, court grants perpetual injunction
5. Breach of injunction is contempt of court

**Example:**
A and B are neighbors. A starts construction encroaching on B's property. B sues and obtains temporary injunction. After trial, if B proves encroachment, court grants perpetual injunction restraining A from encroaching.

### d) Allcard v/s Skinner

#### Answer:

**Allcard v. Skinner (1887) - English Court of Appeal**

**Subject Matter:** Undue Influence

**Facts:**

**1. Plaintiff (Miss Allcard):**
- Joined sisterhood (religious order) called "Sisters of the Poor"
- Took vows including poverty, chastity, and obedience
- One rule: members to surrender all property to Mother Superior

**2. Gifts Made:**
- Over several years, Miss Allcard gave her property (about £7,000) to Mother Superior (defendant - Lady Superior Miss Skinner)
- Gifts made under influence of spiritual guidance

**3. Left the Order:**
- After many years, Miss Allcard left the sisterhood
- Sought to recover property gifted

**4. Legal Arguments:**
- Claimed gifts made under undue influence
- No independent legal advice obtained before making gifts
- Defendant had position of spiritual dominance

**Issues:**

**1. Was there undue influence?**
**2. Could Miss Allcard recover gifts?**

**Held:**

**1. Undue Influence Established:**
Court held gifts were made under undue influence:
- Defendant had spiritual authority over plaintiff
- Relationship of dominance existed
- No independent legal advice taken
- Gifts not result of free and independent judgment

**2. Recovery Barred by Delay:**
However, Miss Allcard COULD NOT recover because:
- Unreasonable delay (laches) in claiming
- She remained in order many years after attaining full knowledge
- Delay amounted to acquiescence/affirmation
- Too late to seek rescission

**Principle Established:**

**1. Undue Influence:**
Where person in position of spiritual or religious authority obtains gifts from follower, presumption of undue influence arises.

**2. Independent Advice:**
In such relationships, person making gift should have independent legal advice to ensure free consent.

**3. Delay Bars Relief:**
Even if undue influence proved, unreasonable delay in seeking relief bars rescission.

**Legal Maxim:** "Equity aids the vigilant, not those who slumber on their rights."

**4. Types of Undue Influence:**
Case illustrates "passive" undue influence - not active coercion, but domination arising from relationship itself.

**Application in India:**

**Section 16(2)(a):**
Recognizes that person in position of authority or fiduciary relation is deemed in position to dominate will of another.

**Similar Indian Cases:**

**Raghunath Prasad v. Sarju Prasad (1924):**
Guru-disciple relationship. Presumption of undue influence when disciple transfers property to guru.

**Relevance:**
- Important authority on undue influence in religious/spiritual relationships
- Illustrates burden shifting when dominant relationship exists
- Shows importance of independent advice
- Demonstrates that delay can bar equitable relief

**Modern Application:**
Principle applies to:
- Religious donations
- Guru-disciple transfers
- Spiritual advisor-devotee relationships
- Any fiduciary relationship where one party dominant

**Key Takeaway:**
While law protects against undue influence, the remedy must be sought promptly. Delay and acquiescence will bar relief even if undue influence is proved.
