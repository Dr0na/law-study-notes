# FREE CONSENT – 10 MARKS QUESTIONS

## Question 1: Define coercion under Section 15 of the Indian Contract Act. What is the effect of coercion on a contract?

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Section 15 - Definition of Coercion

"Coercion is the committing, or threatening to commit, any act forbidden by the Indian Penal Code, or the unlawful detaining, or threatening to detain, any property, to the prejudice of any person whatever, with the intention of causing any person to enter into an agreement."

#### Essential Elements of Coercion

**1. Commission or Threat of Act Forbidden by IPC**
- Actual commission of criminal act, or
- Threat to commit such act
- Must be punishable under IPC

**2. Unlawful Detention or Threat to Detain Property**
- Actual unlawful detention, or
- Threat of unlawful detention

**3. Intention**
- Must intend to cause person to enter agreement
- Coercion must be to induce consent

**4. Against Any Person**
- Coercion can be against any person
- Not limited to contracting party
- Against party, family, stranger, or anyone

**Case Law: Ranganayakamma v. Alwar Setti (1889)**
Money lender detained borrower's son. Father signed note. Coercion established. Son not party to contract but coercion against him vitiated father's consent.

#### Examples of Coercion

**Valid Coercion:**
- Threat to file false criminal case
- Threat to harm family member
- Unlawful detention of goods
- Threat of violence

**Not Coercion:**
- Threat to exercise legal right (e.g., sue for genuine debt)
- Lawful detention
- Fair pressure in negotiations

**Case Law: Chikam Amiraju v. Chikam Seshamma (1918)**
Threat to commit suicide - held NOT coercion as suicide is omission, not act. IPC punishes attempt to suicide, not suicide itself. (Criticized decision)

#### Effect of Coercion - Section 19

**Contract is Voidable at option of party whose consent obtained by coercion.**

**Party Can:**
1. **Rescind the contract** - Avoid it entirely
2. **Affirm the contract** - Continue with it
3. **Claim damages** - For any loss suffered

**Section 19:** "When consent to an agreement is caused by coercion, fraud or misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the party whose consent was so caused."

**Important:** Contract is VOIDABLE, not void. Aggrieved party has choice.

#### Causation Required

**"Caused by" Coercion:**
- Coercion must actually cause consent
- If person would have consented anyway, no vitiation
- "But for" test: But for coercion, would consent be given?

#### Bars to Rescission - Section 19A

**Cannot rescind if:**
1. **Restitution impossible:** Parties cannot be restored to original position
2. **Third party rights:** Bona fide third parties acquired rights for value
3. **Affirmation:** Party has affirmed contract after coercion ceased
4. **Undue delay:** Unreasonable delay in exercising right

#### Restitution - Sections 64 & 65

**On Rescission:**
- Party rescinding must restore benefits received (Section 64)
- Other party must restore what obtained (Section 65)

#### Indian vs. English Law

| **Aspect** | **Indian Law** | **English Law** |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Against whom** | Against any person | Against party or family |
| **Scope** | Wider | Narrower |
| **Definition** | Statutory | Common law |

#### Conclusion
Coercion involves use of criminal threat or unlawful detention to vitiate consent. Under Indian law, coercion against any person vitiates consent, making contract voidable at aggrieved party's option. The law protects freedom of consent while allowing parties to choose whether to continue with or rescind contracts obtained through coercion.

#### Effect on Contract

**Both Make Contract Voidable (Section 19)**

**Special Feature of Undue Influence:**
Court has power under Section 19 to:
- Set aside entirely, OR
- Modify terms to make fair, OR
- Require return of excessive benefit

#### Conclusion
While both coercion and undue influence vitiate free consent, they differ fundamentally in nature and application. Coercion involves criminal force or threats applicable universally, while undue influence involves abuse of position of trust or authority in relationships. Understanding these differences is crucial for identifying vitiating factors and determining appropriate remedies.
