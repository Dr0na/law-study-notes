# LEGALITY OF OBJECT – 10 MARKS QUESTIONS

## Question 1: When is the object or consideration of an agreement unlawful under Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act?

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Section 23 - Unlawful Consideration or Object

"The consideration or object of an agreement is lawful, unless—
- it is forbidden by law; or
- is of such a nature that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law; or
- is fraudulent; or
- involves or implies injury to the person or property of another; or
- the Court regards it as immoral, or opposed to public policy.

In each of these cases, the consideration or object of an agreement is said to be unlawful. Every agreement of which the object or consideration is unlawful is void."

#### Six Grounds of Unlawfulness

### 1. Forbidden by Law

**Meaning:** Expressly prohibited by any law in force.

**Examples:**
- Agreement to commit crime
- Agreement violating FEMA regulations
- Sale of prohibited drugs
- Tax evasion agreements

**Case Law: Gherulal Parakh v. Mahadeodas Maiya (1959)**
Agreement to sell 50 tonnes of gur when law prohibited sale beyond 300 kgs - void as forbidden by law.

### 2. Defeating Provisions of Law

**Meaning:** Though not directly forbidden, would defeat purpose of law if permitted.

**Examples:**
- Agreement to transfer maintenance rights (defeats purpose of maintenance)
- Agreement below minimum wages (defeats Minimum Wages Act)
- Circumventing legal provisions

**Case Law: Nath v. Radha Kishan (1941)**
Agreement ousting court jurisdiction for all disputes - void as defeats access to justice.

### 3. Fraudulent Purpose

**Meaning:** Object involves fraud or intent to defraud.

**Examples:**
- Splitting profits to evade tax
- Deceiving creditors
- False accounting

**Case Law: Alexander v. Rayson (1936)**
Two agreements - one showing low rent (to avoid taxes), another for balance - both void for fraud.

### 4. Injury to Person or Property

**Meaning:** Implies injury to person or property of another.

**Examples:**
- Agreement to commit assault
- Agreement to damage property
- Agreement to defame

**Case Law: Nand Kishore v. Khub Chand (1945)**
Agreement not to give evidence or to give false evidence - void as injurious to justice.

### 5. Immoral Agreements

**Meaning:** Contrary to accepted moral standards.

**Examples:**
- Agreements for prostitution
- Agreements promoting immorality
- Living together without marriage

**Case Law: Pearce v. Brooks (1866)**
Carriage hired to prostitute knowing purpose - void for immorality. Cannot recover hire charges.

**Case Law: Mst. Gulab Kumari v. Ramesh Chander (1965)**
Woman living in immoral relationship promised maintenance - void as immoral.

### 6. Opposed to Public Policy

**Meaning:** Harmful to public interest or welfare.

**Categories:**

**a) Trading with Enemy**
Contracts with enemy aliens during war.

**b) Agreements in Restraint of Trade** (Section 27)
Restraining lawful profession, trade, or business.

**c) Agreements in Restraint of Marriage** (Section 26)
Restraining marriage of any person (except minor).

**d) Agreements in Restraint of Legal Proceedings** (Section 28)
Absolutely restricting right to sue.

**e) Champerty and Maintenance**
Supporting litigation for share in proceeds.

**f) Creating Monopoly**
Agreements creating monopolies harmful to public.

**Case Law: Gujarat Bottling v. Coca Cola (1995)**
Post-termination restraint on trade opposed to public policy.

#### Effect of Unlawful Object/Consideration

**1. Agreement is Void**
Cannot be enforced by either party.

**2. No Restitution**
Generally, money paid cannot be recovered (Ex turpi causa - no action from immoral cause).

**3. Collateral Transactions Also Tainted**
Transactions connected with illegal agreement also void.

#### Section 24 - Part Unlawful

"If any part of a single consideration for one or more objects, or any one or any part of any one of several considerations for a single object, is unlawful, the agreement is void."

**Principle:** Illegal part taints entire agreement.

#### Conclusion
Object and consideration must be lawful for valid contract. Section 23 provides comprehensive grounds for determining unlawfulness. Agreements with unlawful object/consideration are void and unenforceable, protecting public interest and social morality.

## Question 2: "Every agreement in restraint of trade is void." Explain this statement with reference to Section 27 and its exceptions.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Section 27 - Restraint of Trade

"Every agreement by which any one is restrained from exercising a lawful profession, trade or business of any kind, is to that extent void."

**Rationale:**
- Protects individual liberty
- Promotes free competition
- Prevents monopolies
- Constitutional backing (Article 19(1)(g))

#### Absolute Nature in India

**Indian Position:** Absolute prohibition (except statutory exceptions)

**English Position:** Reasonable restraints valid

**Case Law: Madhub Chunder v. Rajcoomar (1874)**
Indian law does not recognize doctrine of reasonableness. All restraints void except exceptions.

**Case Law: Niranjan Shankar v. Century Spinning (1967) - Supreme Court**
Negative covenant restraining employment even after service termination - void. No distinction between partial and total restraint. Reasonableness irrelevant.

#### Three Exceptions to Section 27

### Exception 1: Sale of Goodwill [Proviso 1]

**Conditions:**
1. Actual sale of goodwill must take place
2. Restriction must be reasonable in area
3. Only seller can be restrained
4. Buyer must carry on similar business
5. "Within specified local limits"

**Valid Example:**
A sells medical practice to B for ₹50 lakhs. Agreement: A won't practice within 5 km radius. Valid.

**Invalid Example:**
A agrees not to practice anywhere in India. Area unreasonably wide - void.

### Exception 2: Partnership - During Continuance [Proviso 2]

**Provision:** Partners may agree not to carry on similar business while partnership continues.

**Rationale:**
- Prevents conflict of interest
- Protects partnership interests
- Ensures partner's dedication

**Valid Only:** During partnership subsistence.

### Exception 3: Partnership - After Dissolution [Proviso 3]

**Conditions:**
1. Agreement among partners
2. Local limits must be specified
3. Specified time period
4. After dissolution only

**Valid Example:**
Partners in Pune restaurant agree: After dissolution, no partner opens similar restaurant within 10 km for 3 years. Valid.

**Invalid Example:**
Restriction for entire Maharashtra for 20 years. Too wide - may be void.

#### Employment Contracts

**During Employment:**
Restriction during employment is NOT restraint (voluntary choice).

**Post-Employment:**
Any restriction after employment ends - VOID under Section 27.

**Case Law: Niranjan Shankar (1967)**
Non-compete clause for ex-employee void even if reasonable in time and space.

**Case Law: Gujarat Bottling (1995)**
Exclusivity during contract: Valid
Post-termination restriction: Void

#### Trade Secrets and Confidential Information

**Valid Restrictions:**
- Non-disclosure of trade secrets (protected under separate law)
- Confidential information protection
- During and after employment

**Invalid Restrictions:**
- Non-compete clauses
- Restraint on future employment
- Ban on joining competitors

#### Comparison: India vs. England

| **Aspect** | **India** | **England** |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Rule** | Absolute prohibition | Reasonableness doctrine |
| **Exceptions** | Only 3 statutory | Reasonable restraints valid |
| **Employment** | Post-employment void | Reasonable restrictions valid |
| **Approach** | Strict | Flexible |

#### Conclusion
Section 27 embodies strong public policy favoring freedom of trade. Indian law adopts absolute prohibition with only three narrow exceptions relating to goodwill and partnership. Unlike English law, reasonableness is no defense. This protects individual liberty to earn livelihood, though it may limit freedom of contract. Understanding Section 27 is crucial for drafting employment contracts and business sale agreements.
