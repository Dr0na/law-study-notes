## Question 2: Explain the doctrine of Quantum Meruit with its application in contracts.

### MODEL ANSWER:

**Principle:** When contract cannot be enforced, party who performed can claim reasonable value of work done.

#### When Quantum Meruit Applies

### 1. Contract Becomes Void

When contract discovered void after partial performance, performing party can claim quantum meruit.

**Example:** A contracts to paint B's house. Contract later discovered void. A has painted half. A can claim reasonable payment for work done.

**Note:** Mohori Bibee case held Section 65 doesn't apply to minor's contracts (void ab initio). But applies to other void contracts.

| Reasonable remuneration | Actual loss |
| Quasi-contractual | Contractual |
| Based on benefit received | Based on breach |

#### Calculation of Quantum Meruit

2. Skill and effort required
3. Time spent
4. Materials used
5. Prevailing rates
6. Benefit to defendant

**Not Necessarily:**

- Plaintiff's expenses (focus on benefit)

#### Practical Examples

**Example 3:**

- Legal framework

**Quantum meruit is remedy often applied in quasi-contractual situations.**

#### Conclusion
Quantum meruit is equitable doctrine ensuring persons performing work or rendering services receive reasonable compensation even when contract cannot be enforced. Based on principle that no one should be unjustly enriched at another's expense, it applies when contracts become void, are repudiated, or when work done under void agreements. Available to party not in default who has conferred benefit on other party. Claim is for reasonable value of work done, not contract price or damages. This doctrine balances need for contractual certainty with demands of justice and equity.
