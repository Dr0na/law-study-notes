# OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE – 10 MARKS QUESTIONS

## Question 1: What is an offer? Explain the essentials of a valid offer under the Indian Contract Act, 1872.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Definition of Offer (Section 2(a))

"When one person signifies to another his willingness to do or to abstain from doing anything, with a view to obtaining the assent of that other to such act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal."

The person making the offer is called 'proposer' or 'offeror', and the person to whom it is made is called 'offeree'.

#### Essentials of a Valid Offer

**1. Expression of Willingness**
- Must express willingness to do or abstain from doing something
- Must be communicated to offeree

**2. Intent to Create Legal Relations**
- Offer must be made with intention to create legal obligations
- Social invitations are not offers

**3. Definite and Certain Terms**
- Terms must be clear and unambiguous
- Vague offers cannot create valid contracts

**4. Communication of Offer**
- Must be communicated to offeree
- No acceptance possible without knowledge

**Case Law: Lalman Shukla v. Gauri Dutt (1913)**
Servant traced missing nephew without knowing about reward. Held: No contract as no knowledge of offer.

**5. Distinguished from Invitation to Offer**
- Display of goods, auction advertisements, tenders are invitations to offer
- Actual offer comes from customer/bidder/tenderer

**Case Law: Pharmaceutical Society v. Boots (1953)**
Display of goods in self-service store is invitation to offer, not offer.

**6. May Be Specific or General**
- Specific offer: to particular person(s)
- General offer: to world at large

**Case Law: Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. (1893)**
General offer to public at large can be accepted by anyone performing conditions.

**7. May Be Express or Implied**
- Express: by words (spoken/written)
- Implied: by conduct

**8. Must Be Distinguished from Statement of Intent**
- Mere statement of intention is not an offer
- Must show willingness to be bound

**9. Conditional Offer Acceptable**
- Offer may be subject to conditions
- Conditions must be clearly stated

#### Conclusion
A valid offer must be clear, definite, communicated, and made with intent to create legal relations. Understanding these essentials helps distinguish offers from mere invitations to treat or statements of intention.

## Question 2: Explain the rules regarding communication and revocation of offer and acceptance under Sections 3, 4, and 5 of the Indian Contract Act.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Section 3 - Communication

**Modes of Communication:**
- By any act or omission
- Express or implied
- Must show intention to communicate

#### Section 4 - When Communication is Complete

**1. Communication of Proposal (Offer):**
- As against proposer: When put into transmission
- As against offeree: When comes to his knowledge

**2. Communication of Acceptance:**
- As against acceptor: When put into transmission
- As against proposer: When comes to his knowledge

**3. Communication of Revocation:**
- As against person making it: When put into transmission
- As against person to whom made: When comes to his knowledge

#### Section 5 - Revocation

**Revocation of Proposal:**
- Can be revoked anytime before acceptance is complete as against proposer
- Cannot be revoked after that

**Case Law: Byrne v. Van Tienhoven (1880)**
Offer posted on Oct 1. Acceptance sent Oct 11. Revocation posted Oct 8, received Oct 20. Held: Valid contract formed on Oct 11.

**Revocation of Acceptance:**
- Can be revoked before acceptance is complete as against acceptor
- Cannot be revoked after being put into transmission

#### Postal Rule

When communication by post:
- Acceptance complete when posted (against both parties)
- Offeror bound from moment of posting
- Applies even if letter lost

**Case Law: Adams v. Lindsell (1818)**
Contract complete when acceptance posted, not when received.

#### Instantaneous Communication

For telephone, telex, fax, email:
- Communication complete only when received
- Postal rule does not apply

**Case Law: Entores v. Miles Far East (1955)**
Acceptance by telex complete when and where received.

#### Practical Implications

**Timeline Example:**
- Day 1: A posts offer to B
- Day 3: B receives offer
- Day 4: B posts acceptance (Contract formed)
- Day 6: A receives acceptance

Contract is complete on Day 4 (when B posts acceptance), not Day 6.

#### Conclusion
Understanding when communication is complete is crucial for determining when contracts are formed and whether offers or acceptances can be revoked. The law balances interests of both parties through clear rules.

## Question 3: What is acceptance? State the rules regarding a valid acceptance.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Definition of Acceptance - Section 2(b)

"When the person to whom the proposal is made signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted. A proposal when accepted becomes a promise."

#### Essential Rules for Valid Acceptance

**1. Acceptance Must Be Absolute and Unqualified (Section 7)**

- Must accept all terms of offer without modification
- Conditional acceptance is counter-offer, not acceptance
- Any variation destroys offer

**Case Law: Hyde v. Wrench (1840)**
Counter-offer of £950 against offer of £1,000 destroyed original offer.

**2. Acceptance Must Be Expressed in Prescribed or Reasonable Manner**

- If manner prescribed, must follow it
- If no manner prescribed, must be reasonable
- Silence generally not acceptance

**Case Law: Felthouse v. Bindley (1862)**
"If I hear no more, I consider horse mine" - silence not acceptance.

**3. Acceptance Must Be Communicated**

- Must come to knowledge of offeror
- Mere mental acceptance insufficient
- Communication necessary

**Exception:** General offers can be accepted by performing conditions without prior communication (Carlill case).

**4. Acceptance Must Be by Person to Whom Offer Made**

- Only offeree can accept
- Third party cannot accept offer made to someone else

**5. Acceptance Must Be Given Before Offer Lapses or Revoked**

- If time prescribed, within that time
- If no time, within reasonable time
- Before offer is revoked

**6. Acceptance Must Be Made While Offer Is in Force**

Offer lapses due to:
- Lapse of time
- Non-fulfillment of condition precedent
- Death or insanity of offeror
- Revocation by offeror
- Counter-offer by offeree
- Rejection by offeree

**7. Acceptance May Be Express or Implied**

- Express: by words
- Implied: by conduct

**8. Acceptance Must Succeed Offer**

- Acceptance given before offer is invalid
- Cross offers do not constitute acceptance

**Case Law: Tinn v. Hoffmann (1873)**
Identical cross offers do not create contract.

**9. Offer Must Be Accepted with Intention to Fulfill Terms**

- Not merely acknowledge receipt
- Must intend to create legal obligations

#### Common Issues

**Modified Acceptance:**
Amounts to counter-offer, not acceptance.

**Conditional Acceptance:**
"I accept if..." = counter-offer.

**Partial Acceptance:**
Accepting some terms and rejecting others = not valid acceptance.

**Qualified Acceptance:**
Adding qualifications = counter-offer.

#### Conclusion
Valid acceptance requires absolute assent to all terms of offer, proper communication, and compliance with prescribed or reasonable manner. Understanding these rules prevents disputes about contract formation.

## Question 4: Distinguish between offer and invitation to offer with examples and case laws.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Meaning

**Offer:**
A definite proposal made with intention to create legal obligations, capable of being accepted to form a contract.

**Invitation to Offer (Invitation to Treat):**
An invitation to others to make offers; preliminary communication inviting negotiations.

#### Key Distinctions

| **Basis** | **Offer** | **Invitation to Offer** |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Intent** | Intent to be bound | Inviting others to make offers |
| **Legal Effect** | Acceptance creates contract | No contract until offer made and accepted |
| **Who Makes** | Offeror initiates | Invitor invites offers from others |
| **Result** | Binding when accepted | No binding obligation |

#### Common Examples of Invitations to Offer

**1. Display of Goods in Shop**

**Case Law: Pharmaceutical Society v. Boots Cash Chemists (1953)**
Facts: Self-service shop with goods on shelves with prices.
Held: Display is invitation to offer. Customer makes offer at counter. Shopkeeper accepts or rejects.

**2. Advertisements**

**General Rule:** Most advertisements are invitations to offer, not offers.

**Case Law: Partridge v. Crittenden (1968)**
Advertisement "Bramblefinch cocks and hens, 25 shillings" held invitation to offer.

**Exception:** Advertisements promising rewards are offers.

**Case Law: Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. (1893)**
Advertisement promising £100 reward was held to be offer to public at large.

**3. Auction Sales**

**Case Law: Harris v. Nickerson (1873)**
Facts: Auctioneer advertised sale. Buyer traveled to attend. Sale cancelled.
Held: Advertisement of auction is invitation to offer. Bid is offer. Fall of hammer is acceptance.

**4. Catalogues and Price Lists**
- Merely supply information
- Invitation for customers to make offers

**5. Tenders**

**Invitation to Tender:** Invitation to offer
**Submission of Tender:** Offer
**Acceptance of Tender:** Acceptance creating contract

**6. Railway/Bus Time Tables**
- Publication of timetable is invitation to offer
- Passenger makes offer by purchasing ticket

**7. Prospectus of Company**
- Prospectus inviting share applications: invitation to offer
- Application for shares: offer
- Allotment of shares: acceptance

**8. Menu Card in Restaurant**
- Display of menu is invitation to offer
- Order placed: offer
- Acceptance by waiter/service: acceptance

#### Examples Where Display IS an Offer

**Case Law: Lefkowitz v. Great Minneapolis Surplus Store (1957) - US**
Facts: "Saturday 9 AM Sharp, 3 brand new fur coats, worth $100, first come first served, $1 each."
Held: This was offer, not invitation, due to specific, clear, definite terms leaving nothing open for negotiation.

#### Statement of Price vs. Offer

**Case Law: Harvey v. Facey (1893)**
Facts: H telegraphed: "Will you sell Bumper Hall Pen? Telegraph lowest price." F replied: "Lowest price £900." H telegraphed acceptance.
Held: F's telegram was statement of price, not offer. Mere supply of information.

#### Practical Importance

**Why Distinction Matters:**

1. **Contract Formation:** Determines when contract comes into existence
2. **Withdrawal:** Invitation can be withdrawn anytime; offer can be revoked before acceptance
3. **Acceptance:** Only offer can be accepted; invitation cannot be accepted
4. **Legal Liability:** Offer creates legal obligations when accepted; invitation doesn't

#### Test to Distinguish

**Ask:**
1. Does it show definite intention to be bound?
2. Are terms complete and certain?
3. Would acceptance immediately create contract?
4. Is it addressed to specific person/public at large with certainty?

**If yes:** Likely an offer
**If no:** Likely invitation to offer

#### Conclusion
The distinction between offer and invitation to offer is crucial for determining when a contract comes into existence. While offers create legal obligations when accepted, invitations to offer merely initiate negotiations. Understanding this distinction prevents misunderstandings in commercial transactions and clarifies the rights and obligations of parties.
