# BREACH OF CONTRACT AND REMEDIES – 10 MARKS QUESTIONS

## Question 1: Write a detailed note on Rescission of contract.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Introduction

Rescission is a remedy available when a contract is voidable due to vitiating factors such as fraud, misrepresentation, coercion, or undue influence, or when both parties mutually agree to cancel the contract. It involves canceling or annulling the contract, with the objective of restoring parties to their original positions as if the contract never existed.

#### Meaning of Rescission

**Rescission:** Cancellation or annulment of contract, putting an end to it as if it never existed.

**Effect:** Contract becomes void. Parties freed from obligations and must restore benefits received.

**Types of Rescission:**

**1. Rescission by Agreement (Mutual):**
Both parties agree to cancel contract.

**2. Rescission for Breach:**
Innocent party rescinds due to other party's breach.

**3. Rescission for Vitiating Factors:**
Party whose consent vitiated (fraud, coercion, etc.) rescinds contract.

#### Legal Provisions

**Section 19 - When Consent Vitiated:**
"When consent to an agreement is caused by coercion, fraud or misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the party whose consent was so caused."

**Section 64 - Consequences of Rescission:**
"When a person at whose option a contract is voidable rescinds it, the other party thereto need not perform any promise therein contained in which he is promisor. The party rescinding a voidable contract shall, if he has received any benefit thereunder from another party to such contract, restore such benefit, so far as may be, to the person from whom it was received."

**Section 65 - Obligation to Restore Benefits:**
"When an agreement is discovered to be void, or when a contract becomes void, any person who has received any advantage under such agreement or contract is bound to restore it, or to make compensation for it to the person from whom he received it."

#### Grounds for Rescission

**1. Coercion (Section 15):**
Consent obtained by threats or force.

**2. Undue Influence (Section 16):**
Using position to dominate will of another.

**3. Fraud (Section 17):**
Intentional false representation to deceive.

**4. Misrepresentation (Section 18):**
Innocent false statement of fact.

All obligations under contract cease.

**2. Parties Freed:**
Neither party bound to perform.

**3. Restitution Required (Section 64):**
Party rescinding must restore benefits received.

**4. Compensation if Restoration Impossible:**
If benefit cannot be restored in kind, must compensate.

**5. Other Party's Obligations Cease:**
Other party need not perform promises.

#### Bars to Rescission - Section 19A

**Section 19A:** "A contract which is voidable on account of coercion, fraud or misrepresentation may be expressly or impliedly ratified, either before or after the institution of any proceeding for the rescission of such contract. A contract which has been ratified cannot afterwards be rescinded."

**Cannot Rescind If:**

**1. Restitution Impossible:**
Parties cannot be restored to original position.

**Example:** Goods consumed, destroyed, or substantially altered.

**2. Third Party Rights:**
Bona fide purchaser for value acquired rights in subject matter.

**Example:** A sells car to B by fraud. B sells to C (innocent buyer). A cannot rescind against C.

**3. Affirmation:**
Party has affirmed contract after discovering vitiating factor.

**Example:** After discovering fraud, party continues to perform contract. Treated as affirmation.

**Affirmation may be:**
- **Express:** Explicitly stating intention to continue
- **Implied:** Conduct showing acceptance (delay, taking benefits, etc.)

**4. Undue Delay:**
Unreasonable delay in exercising right to rescind.

**Principle:** Law helps vigilant, not those who sleep on their rights.

**Case Law: Prem Raj v. Phool Bai**
Party who delays unreasonably loses right to rescind.

#### Rescission by Agreement (Mutual Rescission)

**When:** Both parties mutually agree to cancel contract.

**Requirements:**
1. Mutual consent
2. Consideration (each party's release is consideration for other's)
3. Intention to rescind

**Effect:** Contract discharged. Parties freed from obligations.

**Example:** A contracts to sell land to B. Both later agree to cancel contract. Valid mutual rescission.

#### Rescission for Breach

**When Material Breach:**
Innocent party can treat contract as repudiated and rescind.

**Material Breach:** Substantial breach going to root of contract.

**Example:** A agrees to supply 1000 kg rice. Supplies only 100 kg. B can rescind for material breach.

#### Partial Rescission

**Court's Discretion (Especially in Undue Influence):**
Court may:
- Set aside entire contract, OR
- Modify terms to make fair, OR
- Direct return of excessive benefit

**Example:** Money lender obtains promissory note for ₹10 lakhs by undue influence when actual loan was ₹5 lakhs. Court may reduce note to ₹5 lakhs plus reasonable interest instead of rescinding entirely.

#### Practical Examples

**Example 1: Fraud**
A sells car to B misrepresenting mileage. B discovers fraud within month.
- B can rescind contract
- Must return car
- Can claim refund of price
- Can also claim damages for fraud

**Example 2: Coercion**
A threatens B's family. B transfers property under threat.
- B can rescind transfer
- Must be done promptly after coercion ceases
- If B delays years, may lose right

**Example 3: Third Party Rights**
A sells goods to B by fraud. B sells to C (innocent buyer). A discovers fraud.
- A can rescind against B
- But cannot recover goods from C (innocent third party)
- Can claim damages from B

**Example 4: Affirmation**
A buys shares based on B's misrepresentation. After discovering misrepresentation, A receives dividends for 2 years.
- A's conduct shows affirmation
- Cannot later rescind
- Right lost by delay and acceptance of benefits

#### Conclusion

Rescission is an important equitable remedy that allows cancellation of contracts vitiated by fraud, coercion, undue influence, or misrepresentation, or contracts that parties mutually wish to terminate. It aims to restore parties to positions before contract, ensuring justice when consent was not freely given. However, the right to rescind is subject to important bars - impossibility of restitution, third party rights, affirmation, and undue delay - which balance the need for contractual certainty with protection of the deceived party. Understanding rescission is crucial for parties seeking to exit contracts obtained through improper means while respecting rights of innocent third parties and the principle that parties must act promptly to protect their rights. The remedy ensures contracts are based on genuine consent while maintaining stability in commercial transactions.

## Question 2: Explain the types of damages available under the Indian Contract Act for breach of contract.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Introduction

When a contract is breached, the primary remedy available to the aggrieved party is compensation in the form of damages. The Indian Contract Act, 1872, particularly Sections 73 and 74, deals with various types of damages that may be claimed for breach of contract.

#### Types of Damages

### 1. Ordinary/General Damages (Section 73)

**Nature:**
Compensation for loss naturally arising from breach in ordinary course.

**Section 73 Provision:**
Party entitled to compensation for loss which:
- Naturally arose in usual course of things from breach, OR
- Parties knew when making contract would likely result from breach

**Case Law: Hadley v. Baxendale (1854)**
Only reasonably foreseeable losses recoverable.

### 2. Special Damages (Section 73)

**Nature:**
Damages for loss arising from special circumstances known to parties at time of contract.

**Example:** Seller knows buyer will re-sell goods. Seller's breach causes loss of re-sale profit. Buyer can claim special damages.

### 3. Nominal Damages

**Nature:**
Small sum awarded when breach proved but no substantial loss.

**Purpose:** Vindicate rights even without actual loss.

**Example:** Technical breach with no financial loss - nominal damages (₹100-500) awarded.

### 4. Liquidated Damages and Penalty (Section 74)

**Section 74:**
If sum named in contract for breach, or penalty stipulated, party entitled to reasonable compensation not exceeding that amount.

**Indian Position:** No distinction between penalty and liquidated damages.

**Case Law: Maula Bux v. Union of India (1970)**
Court awards reasonable compensation up to stipulated sum regardless of whether penalty or liquidated damages.

### 5. Vindictive/Exemplary Damages

**Generally NOT awarded in India for contract breach.**

Only compensatory damages, not punitive.

**Exception:** Breach of promise to marry - some amount for mental agony may be awarded.

#### Principles Governing Damages

**1. Remoteness:**
Only proximate losses, not remote ones.

**2. Mitigation (Section 73 proviso):**
Injured party must take reasonable steps to minimize loss.

**3. Certainty:**
Damages must be proved with reasonable certainty.

**4. Causation:**
Breach must be proximate cause of loss.

#### Conclusion

The Indian Contract Act provides for various types of damages to compensate the aggrieved party for breach of contract. While ordinary and special damages cover foreseeable losses, nominal damages vindicate rights, and Section 74 governs pre-estimated damages. The principles of remoteness, mitigation, and certainty ensure that only genuine, foreseeable, and unavoidable losses are compensated, balancing protection of injured party with fairness to breaching party.

## Question 3: What is anticipatory breach of contract? Explain the rights of the aggrieved party.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Introduction

Anticipatory breach of contract is a unique concept where breach occurs before the time fixed for performance. It allows the aggrieved party to seek remedy immediately rather than waiting for the actual due date of performance.

#### Definition

**Anticipatory Breach:**
When a party to contract, before the time for performance, either:
1. Expresses intention not to perform (express repudiation), OR
2. Makes performance impossible by his own act (implied repudiation)

**Also Called:** Repudiation before performance date.

#### Types of Anticipatory Breach

**1. Express Repudiation:**
Party clearly and unequivocally states he will not perform.

**Example:** A contracts to deliver goods on 31st December. On 1st December, A informs B he will not supply. Express anticipatory breach.

**2. Implied Repudiation:**
Party does act making performance impossible.

**Example:** A contracts to sell specific land to B on 15th January. On 1st January, A sells same land to C. Implied anticipatory breach.

#### Rights of Aggrieved Party

**Option 1: Treat Contract as Repudiated Immediately**

Aggrieved party can:
- Accept the repudiation
- Treat contract as discharged immediately
- Sue for breach without waiting for performance date
- Make alternative arrangements

**Option 2: Wait for Performance Date**

Aggrieved party can:
- Not accept repudiation
- Keep contract alive
- Wait until due date
- Sue for breach if not performed on due date

#### Leading Case Law: Frost v. Knight (1872)

**Facts:**
- Defendant promised to marry plaintiff after his father's death
- During father's lifetime, defendant married another woman
- Plaintiff sued immediately without waiting for father's death

**Held:**
- Plaintiff could sue immediately
- Need not wait for contingent event (father's death)
- Defendant's action made future performance impossible
- Anticipatory breach established

**Principle:** When party makes performance impossible by his own act, other party can sue immediately.

#### Indian Case Law

**Karnail Singh v. Bhatia General Supplies (1977)**
Contract for supply of machines. Supplier sold machines to another before delivery date. Purchaser could immediately sue for anticipatory breach.

#### Measure of Damages

**General Rule:**
Damages assessed as of date of anticipatory breach (when repudiation accepted), not original performance date.

**Mitigation:**
Innocent party must take reasonable steps to mitigate loss immediately.

**Example:**
A contracts to supply goods on 31st December at ₹100/unit. On 1st December, A repudiates. Market price on 1st December is ₹110/unit. B should buy from market at ₹110 and claim ₹10/unit difference.

#### Advantages of Immediate Action

1. Prompt remedy without waiting
2. Can make alternate arrangements immediately
3. Mitigate losses effectively
4. Certainty in business dealings
5. Prevents further complications

#### Risks of Waiting

If innocent party chooses to wait:
- Contract remains alive
- Supervening events may discharge contract (frustration)
- May lose right to claim if circumstances change

#### Conclusion

Anticipatory breach provides immediate remedy when party repudiates contract before performance is due. The aggrieved party has option to either accept repudiation and sue immediately or wait for performance date. This flexibility allows prompt resolution and enables parties to mitigate losses effectively. Understanding anticipatory breach is crucial for protecting contractual rights and making timely decisions when faced with pre-performance repudiation.
