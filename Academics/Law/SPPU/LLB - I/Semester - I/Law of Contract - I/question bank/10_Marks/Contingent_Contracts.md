# CONTINGENT CONTRACTS – 10 MARKS QUESTIONS

## Question 1: Define contingent contract. Explain the rules for enforcement of contingent contracts under Sections 32 to 36.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Definition - Section 31

"A 'contingent contract' is a contract to do or not to do something, if some event, collateral to such contract, does or does not happen."

**Elements:**
1. Contract to do or not do something
2. Performance depends on event
3. Event must be collateral (incidental) to contract
4. Event must be uncertain

**Example:** A agrees to pay B ₹10 lakhs if B's ship arrives from London. Contract to pay (main obligation) contingent on ship's arrival (collateral event).

#### Rules for Enforcement

### Section 32 - Contingent on Happening of Event

**Rule:** Contract enforceable only when event happens. If event becomes impossible, contract becomes void.

**Illustration:** A promises to pay B if A survives C. Can be enforced only if A survives C. If A dies before C, contract void.

**Example:** Insurance - Pay if fire occurs. Enforceable when fire happens. If policy expires without fire, no payment due.

### Section 33 - Contingent on Non-happening of Event

**Rule:** Contract enforceable when happening of event becomes impossible.

**Illustration:** A promises to pay B if certain ship does NOT return. Ship sinks. Contract enforceable when sinking confirmed (return impossible).

**Example:** A promises to employ B if C does not return from abroad within 6 months. Enforceable when:
- 6 months pass without C returning, OR
- C dies (return impossible)

### Section 34 - Contingent on Conduct of Person

**Rule:** If event depends on how person will act, contract becomes void when person does something making specified action impossible.

**Illustration:** A promises to pay B if B marries C. C marries D. Marriage of B to C now impossible. Contract void.

**Case Law: Frost v. Knight (1872)**
Man promised to marry woman after father's death. Married another woman during father's lifetime. Woman could sue immediately.

### Section 35 - Happening Within Fixed Time

**Two Parts:**

**Part 1: Event happens within time**
Contract enforceable if event happens within fixed time.
Contract void if:
- Time expires without event happening, OR
- Event becomes impossible before time expires

**Illustration:** A promises to pay B if ship returns within one year.
- Enforceable if ship returns within year
- Void if: (a) year expires without return, OR (b) ship burns within year

**Part 2: Event doesn't happen within time**
Contract enforceable if:
- Time expires and event has not happened, OR
- Before time expires, it becomes certain event won't happen

**Illustration:** A promises to pay if ship does NOT return within year.
- Enforceable if: (a) year passes without return, OR (b) ship burns (return impossible)

### Section 36 - Impossible Events

**Rule:** Contingent agreements on impossible events are void, whether impossibility known to parties or not.

**Types of Impossibility:**
- Physical impossibility
- Legal impossibility

**Illustration:** A agrees to pay B if B marries A's daughter C. C was dead at time of agreement. Void.

**Example:** Agreement to pay if person brings back someone who died years ago - void for impossibility.

#### Summary Table

| **Section** | **Type** | **Enforceable When** | **Void When** |
|-------------|----------|---------------------|---------------|
| 32 | Event happens | Event happens | Event impossible |
| 33 | Event doesn't happen | Event impossible | Event happens |
| 34 | Conduct of person | Specified conduct | Conduct impossible |
| 35 | Within time | Event within time | Time lapses or event impossible |
| 35 | Not within time | Time lapses or event impossible | Event happens |
| 36 | Impossible event | Never | Always (from beginning) |

#### Contingent vs. Wagering Agreement

| **Contingent Contract** | **Wagering Agreement** |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Valid (Section 31) | Void (Section 30) |
| Genuine interest in subject | No interest except stake |
| Event collateral | Event is essence |
| May be one-sided | Always mutual |
| Example: Insurance | Example: Betting |

#### Practical Applications

**1. Insurance:** Payment contingent on loss occurring
**2. Guarantee:** Guarantor pays if principal debtor defaults
**3. Indemnity:** Indemnifier compensates if loss happens
**4. Conditional Sale:** Sale contingent on buyer obtaining finance
**5. Employment:** Job offer contingent on medical clearance

#### Conclusion
Contingent contracts provide framework for structuring obligations based on uncertain events. Sections 32-36 precisely determine when such contracts become enforceable or void, ensuring certainty in commercial transactions. These provisions are essential for insurance, guarantee, and conditional sales agreements.

## Question 2: Distinguish between contingent contracts and wagering agreements with examples.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Definitions

**Contingent Contract (Section 31):**
Contract to do or not do something if some event collateral to contract does or does not happen.

**Wagering Agreement (Section 30):**
Agreement where parties with opposite views about uncertain event mutually agree that dependent on event, one wins what other loses, with no other interest except stake.

#### Key Distinctions

### 1. Legal Status

**Contingent Contract:**
- Valid and enforceable (Section 31)
- Recognized by law
- Courts will enforce

**Wagering Agreement:**
- Void (Section 30)
- Not enforceable
- No legal remedy

### 2. Interest in Subject Matter

**Contingent Contract:**
- Parties have genuine interest
- Interest exists independent of contract
- Commercial or personal stake

**Example:** A insures his house. A has insurable interest in his own house regardless of insurance.

**Wagering Agreement:**
- No interest except stake
- Interest created only by bet
- Pure speculation

**Example:** A and B bet on whether C's house burns. Neither owns C's house.

### 3. Purpose

**Contingent Contract:**
- Legitimate business purpose
- Risk management
- Protection against loss
- Planning for uncertain events

**Wagering Agreement:**
- Gambling/speculation
- No productive purpose
- Win money by chance
- Entertainment (at best)

### 4. Nature of Promises

**Contingent Contract:**
- May be one-sided
- Not necessarily reciprocal
- Unilateral promises possible

**Example:** Insurance - only insurer promises payment. Insured pays premium (not contingent promise).

**Wagering Agreement:**
- Always mutual promises
- Both parties stand to win or lose
- Reciprocal obligations
- Zero-sum game

**Example:** A and B bet ₹10,000 each on match. Both have stakes.

### 5. Relationship of Event to Contract

**Contingent Contract:**
- Event is collateral (incidental) to contract
- Contract has independent purpose
- Event determines timing/performance

**Example:** Sale of property contingent on buyer obtaining loan. Sale is purpose; loan is collateral condition.

**Wagering Agreement:**
- Event is essence of agreement
- No purpose except betting on event
- Entire agreement revolves around event

**Example:** Betting on election results - election outcome IS the whole purpose.

### 6. Control and Views

**Contingent Contract:**
- Parties need not have opposite views
- Both may want same outcome
- May control or influence event

**Example:** Sale contingent on seller obtaining clearance. Both want clearance.

**Wagering Agreement:**
- Must have opposite views
- One says event happens, other says doesn't
- Cannot control event (if controlled, not wager)

### 7. Social Utility

**Contingent Contract:**
- Beneficial to society
- Facilitates commerce
- Risk management tool
- Economic value

**Wagering Agreement:**
- Harmful to society
- Encourages gambling
- No productive value
- Against public policy

#### Comparison Table

| **Basis** | **Contingent Contract** | **Wagering Agreement** |
|-----------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| **Legal Status** | Valid | Void |
| **Interest** | Genuine interest | Only stake |
| **Purpose** | Business/protective | Gambling |
| **Promises** | May be one-sided | Always mutual |
| **Event** | Collateral | Essence |
| **Views** | Not necessarily opposite | Must be opposite |
| **Social Value** | Beneficial | Harmful |
| **Example** | Insurance | Betting |

#### Illustrative Examples

**Example 1: Insurance vs. Bet**

**Contingent Contract:** A insures his car for ₹10 lakhs. Insurance company pays if car damaged.
- A has insurable interest (owns car)
- Purpose: Protection against loss
- Valid contract

**Wagering Agreement:** A and B bet ₹10,000 on whether C's car will be damaged.
- Neither A nor B owns C's car
- No interest except stake
- Purpose: Gambling
- Void agreement

**Example 2: Conditional Sale vs. Match Bet**

**Contingent Contract:** A agrees to buy B's house if A gets bank loan within 3 months.
- Genuine interest in buying house
- Loan is condition
- Valid

**Wagering Agreement:** A and B bet ₹50,000 on cricket match result.
- No interest except winning stake
- Pure gambling
- Void

**Example 3: Guarantee vs. Bet**

**Contingent Contract:** C guarantees A's loan to B. C pays if A defaults.
- C has interest (relationship with A)
- Purpose: Help A obtain loan
- Valid

**Wagering Agreement:** C and D bet on whether A will default.
- C and D have no interest except bet
- Pure speculation
- Void

#### Important Case Law

**Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. (1893)**
Company offered £100 reward to anyone using product as directed and still getting flu.
Held: Not wager but valid contingent contract. Company had commercial interest in promoting product.

**Mahadeo Parshad v. Parmeshwar Sahai (1963)**
Life insurance policy upheld as contingent contract, not wager. Insurable interest distinguishes it from wager.

#### Conclusion
While both contingent contracts and wagering agreements involve uncertainty, they differ fundamentally in purpose, legal status, and social utility. Contingent contracts serve legitimate commercial purposes and are valid, while wagers are pure gambling without genuine interest in subject matter and are void. The key distinction is whether parties have interest beyond stake itself. Law protects contingent contracts while prohibiting wagers to promote commerce while discouraging gambling.
