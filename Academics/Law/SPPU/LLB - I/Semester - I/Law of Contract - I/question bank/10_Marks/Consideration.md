# CONSIDERATION – 10 MARKS QUESTIONS

## Question 1: Define consideration. Explain the exceptions to the rule "An agreement without consideration is void" under Section 25 of the Indian Contract Act.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Definition - Section 2(d)

"When, at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains from doing, or promises to do or to abstain from doing, something, such act or abstinence or promise is called a consideration for the promise."

**Simple Meaning:** Something of value exchanged for a promise.

#### Essentials of Consideration

1. Must move at desire of promisor
2. May move from promisee or any other person
3. May be past, present, or future
4. Must be real, not illusory
5. Need not be adequate but must be sufficient

#### General Rule - Section 25

"An agreement made without consideration is void, unless..."

**Rationale:** Consideration shows seriousness of intent and reciprocity.

#### Exceptions to "No Consideration, No Contract"

### Exception 1: Natural Love and Affection [Section 25(1)]

**Conditions:**
1. Agreement in writing
2. Registered
3. Between parties in near relation
4. Made on account of natural love and affection

**Case Law: Rajlukhy Dabee v. Bhootnath Mookerjee (1900)**
Husband's promise to pay wife maintenance during quarrels - not enforceable. Not made out of love and affection.

**Valid Example:**
Father executes registered written document gifting property to son out of love. Valid without consideration.

### Exception 2: Compensation for Past Voluntary Services [Section 25(2)]

**Conditions:**
1. Services rendered voluntarily
2. For the promisor
3. Promisor promises to compensate
4. Services not at promisor's desire initially

**Case Law: Sindha Shri Ganpatsinghji v. Abraham (1895)**
S advanced money to save A's property. Later A promised to repay. Held: Enforceable.

**Example:**
A finds B's lost wallet and returns it. B promises to pay ₹5,000. Enforceable.

### Exception 5: Agency (Section 185)

No consideration necessary to create agency relationship.

### Exception 6: Remission/Extension (Section 63)

Creditor may waive debt or extend time without consideration if in writing or part payment made.

#### Comparison: Indian vs. English Law

| **Aspect** | **Indian Law** | **English Law** |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Stranger consideration** | Valid | Invalid (must move from promisee) |
| **Past consideration** | Valid | Generally invalid |
| **Time-barred debt** | Written promise sufficient | New consideration required |

#### Conclusion
While consideration is generally essential, the Act recognizes exceptions based on moral obligations, past services, and written promises. These exceptions balance legal requirements with fairness and moral duties.

## Question 2: "Consideration need not be adequate but must be sufficient." Explain this statement with case laws.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Meaning of the Principle

**Adequate:** Equal in value to what is received
**Sufficient:** Having some value in eyes of law

**Principle:** Courts don't assess whether parties made good bargain, but ensure consideration has legal value.

#### Consideration Need Not Be Adequate

**Freedom of Contract:**
Parties free to fix their own price. Court doesn't interfere in commercial decisions.

**Subjective Value:**
Value varies from person to person.

**Case Law: Thomas v. Thomas (1842)**
Facts: Widow allowed to occupy house for £1 per year when actual value much more.
Held: £1 sufficient consideration even though grossly inadequate.

**Case Law: Chappell & Co. v. Nestle (1960)**
Facts: Records sold for money plus three chocolate wrappers (thrown away).
Held: Wrappers part of consideration despite negligible value.

**Case Law: Haigh v. Brooks (1839)**
Facts: Guarantee document exchanged, turned out worthless.
Held: Surrender of document (even worthless) is sufficient consideration.

#### Consideration Must Be Sufficient

**Meaning:** Must have some value in law; not illusory or meaningless.

**Examples of Insufficient Consideration:**

**1. Illusory Promise**
"I will pay if I feel like it" - Not binding.

**2. Existing Legal Duty**
Performing existing duty not fresh consideration.

**3. Impossible Acts**
Promise to do impossible thing.

**4. Illegal Acts**
Illegal consideration is no consideration.

**5. Vague Consideration**
Too uncertain to constitute consideration.

#### When Inadequacy Matters

Courts may examine adequacy as evidence of:
- Fraud
- Undue influence
- Coercion
- Misrepresentation
- Unconscionable bargain

**Not about adequacy itself, but vitiating factors.**

#### Past, Present, Future Consideration

**Past:** Already done before promise (Valid in India)
**Present:** Simultaneous with promise (Valid)
**Future:** To be done in future (Valid)

**Case Law: Durga Prasad v. Baldeo (1880)**
Work not done at promisor's desire - insufficient consideration.

**Case Law: Kedar Nath v. Gorie Mohamed (1886)**
Work done at promisor's desire - valid consideration.

#### Practical Examples

**Example 1: Adequate but Not Sufficient**
A promises to pay B if B breathes (something B would do anyway). Not sufficient consideration.

**Example 2: Insufficient but Offered Adequate Value**
A promises to pay B for committing theft. Illegal - insufficient consideration regardless of amount.

**Example 3: Inadequate but Sufficient**
A sells vintage car worth ₹10 lakhs to friend for ₹1 lakh. Valid if no fraud/undue influence.

#### Conclusion
The law respects parties' freedom to determine their own consideration while ensuring promises have genuine legal value. Adequacy is parties' concern; sufficiency is law's concern. Courts intervene only when inadequacy evidences vitiation of consent or illegality.

## Question 3: Explain the doctrine "Consideration may move from the promisee or any other person" with the help of case law.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### The Doctrine - Section 2(d)

Section 2(d) explicitly states: "the promisee or any other person"

**Meaning:** In Indian law, consideration need not move from the promisee alone. It can move from any third person.

#### English Law Position

**Doctrine of Privity:**
- Consideration must move from promisee
- Stranger to consideration cannot sue
- Only parties to contract can sue

**Indian Law Position:**
- More liberal
- Consideration may move from third party
- Beneficiary can enforce even if not provider of consideration

#### Landmark Case: Chinnaya v. Ramayya (1882)

**Facts:**
- Old lady (A) gifted property to daughter (B)
- B promised to pay annuity of ₹653 to A's sister (C)
- B failed to pay C
- C sued B for annuity

**Issue:** Can C sue when she gave no consideration?

**Held:**
- C can sue even though not party to contract
- Consideration (property) moved from A (old lady)
- C is beneficiary of promise
- Under Section 2(d), consideration from "any other person" is valid
- C entitled to enforce promise

**Significance:**
Established that in India, stranger to consideration can sue if he is beneficiary of promise.

#### Distinction: Stranger to Consideration vs. Stranger to Contract

**Stranger to Consideration:**
- Person who gave no consideration
- But is beneficiary of promise
- CAN sue in India

**Stranger to Contract:**
- Person not party to contract
- Not privy to contract
- CANNOT sue even in India (doctrine of privity of contract applies)

**Illustration:**
A and B make contract for benefit of C.
- C is stranger to contract (not party)
- If consideration moves from A, C is not stranger to consideration (consideration from third party)
- C can sue in India

#### Application and Examples

**Example 1: Family Arrangement**
Father transfers property to son. Son promises to maintain father's brother (uncle). Uncle can sue son even though uncle gave no consideration. Consideration moved from father.

**Example 2: Trust**
A transfers property to B (trustee) for benefit of C (beneficiary). C can enforce even though C gave no consideration.

**Example 3: Business Context**
Company A transfers shares to Company B. B promises to pay dividends to A's creditor C. C can sue B.

#### Other Relevant Provisions

**Section 2(d):** Allows consideration from any person

**Section 17 (Explanation):** Fraud by "any person" with promisor's connivance

**Section 19:** Aggrieved party can rescind contract (beneficiary has rights)

#### Comparison with English Law

| **Aspect** | **Indian Law** | **English Law** |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Consideration from** | Promisee or any person | Only from promisee |
| **Stranger to consideration** | Can sue if beneficiary | Cannot sue |
| **Flexibility** | More liberal | Stricter |

#### Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act, 1999 (UK)

**Recent Development in UK:**
- Allows third party beneficiaries to enforce contracts
- More aligned with Indian position now
- Subject to conditions

#### Practical Significance

**Benefits:**
1. Protects beneficiaries
2. Recognizes family arrangements
3. Facilitates trust and agency
4. More equitable outcomes

**Cautions:**
- Third party must be identifiable beneficiary
- Cannot be remote or unintended beneficiary
- Promisor's liability must be to that specific person

#### Conclusion
The Indian Contract Act's provision allowing consideration to move from any person reflects a more liberal and equitable approach than traditional English law. This doctrine protects beneficiaries who, though not providing consideration themselves, are intended recipients of the promise. The landmark Chinnaya case established this principle firmly in Indian jurisprudence, enabling family members, trust beneficiaries, and other intended recipients to enforce promises made for their benefit.
