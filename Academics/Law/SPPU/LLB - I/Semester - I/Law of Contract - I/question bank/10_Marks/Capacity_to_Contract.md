# CAPACITY TO CONTRACT – 10 MARKS QUESTIONS

## Question 1: Who are competent to contract under Section 11? Discuss the position of minor's agreements under Indian Contract Act.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Section 11 - Competency to Contract

"Every person is competent to contract who is—
(a) of the age of majority according to the law to which he is subject; and
(b) of sound mind; and
(c) is not disqualified from contracting by any law to which he is subject."

#### Three Classes Incompetent to Contract

1. **Minors** (below 18 years; 21 if guardian appointed)
2. **Persons of unsound mind**
3. **Persons disqualified by law**

#### Position of Minor's Agreements

**Landmark Case: Mohori Bibee v. Dharmodas Ghose (1903)**

**Facts:**
- Dharmodas (minor) mortgaged property to money lender
- Lender knew he was minor
- Minor's mother filed suit to set aside mortgage

**Held by Privy Council:**
1. Minor's agreement is VOID AB INITIO (not voidable)
2. Section 11 makes minors incompetent to contract
3. Contract void from beginning, creates no obligations
4. Minor need not return money obtained
5. Even fraudulent representation by minor doesn't validate contract

#### Important Rules Regarding Minor's Contracts

**1. Agreement Void Ab Initio**
- Void from beginning, not voidable
- Cannot be enforced against minor
- Cannot be enforced by minor

**2. No Estoppel Against Minor**
- Even if minor fraudulently represents himself as major
- Contract remains void
- Principle: Law protects minors even from their own folly

**Case Law: Sadiq Ali Khan v. Jai Kishori (1928)**
Minor obtained loan by fraudulent misrepresentation about age. Contract void. However, specific property (if identifiable and traceable) can be recovered.

**3. No Ratification on Attaining Majority**
- Void contract cannot become valid by ratification
- Fresh contract with new consideration required

**4. Minor's Property Cannot Be Made Liable**
- Exception to general rule that minor can be liable for necessaries
- Property may be liable, not minor personally

**5. No Specific Performance**
- Court will not grant specific performance of minor's agreement

**6. Minor Cannot Be Partner**
- But can be admitted to benefits of partnership (Partnership Act, Section 30)

**7. Minor Can Be Agent**
- Can act as agent (Section 184)
- But not personally liable

**8. Minor Not Adjudged Insolvent**
- Cannot contract debts, so cannot be insolvent

**9. Minor Can Be Beneficiary**
- Minor can receive benefits under contracts between adults

**Case Law: Chinnaya v. Ramayya (1882)**
Minor can enforce promise made for his benefit even though not party.

#### Exception: Necessaries (Section 68)

**Section 68:** "If a person, incapable of entering into a contract, or any one whom he is legally bound to support, is supplied by another person with necessaries suited to his condition in life, the person who has furnished such supplies is entitled to be reimbursed from the property of such incapable person."

**What are Necessaries:**
- Food, clothing, shelter
- Education
- Medical treatment
- Marriage expenses (in India)

**Case Law: Nash v. Inman (1908)**
11 fancy waistcoats supplied to Cambridge student - not necessaries as adequately supplied. Cannot recover.

**Case Law: Chapple v. Cooper (1844)**
Funeral expenses for deceased husband - necessaries. Minor's estate liable.

**Important:** Only minor's PROPERTY liable, not minor personally.

#### Protection to Other Party

**Limited Relief Available:**

**1. Restitution of Specific Property**
If minor obtained specific property by fraud and still possesses it, may be recovered.

**2. No Personal Action**
Cannot sue minor personally even if he committed fraud.

**3. Tort Liability**
Minor liable for torts, but action in tort cannot be used to indirectly enforce void contract.

**Case Law: Leslie v. Sheill (1914)**
Action in deceit (tort) not allowed as it would indirectly enforce void contract.

#### Conclusion
Minors are incompetent to contract under Section 11. Their agreements are void ab initio as established in Mohori Bibee case. Law adopts protective approach, ensuring minors cannot be bound by contracts even if they act fraudulently. Only exception is for necessaries, where minor's property (not person) may be liable. This protection is absolute and in minor's best interest.

## Question 2: Explain the position of persons of unsound mind regarding contractual capacity. What is the test for soundness of mind?

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Section 12 - Soundness of Mind

"A person is said to be of sound mind for the purpose of making a contract, if, at the time when he makes it, he is capable of understanding it and of forming a rational judgment as to its effect upon his interests."

#### Test for Soundness of Mind

**Three Requirements:**

**1. Capacity to Understand**
Person must understand nature and effect of contract.

**2. Rational Judgment**
Ability to form reasonable judgment about contract's consequences on his interests.

**3. At Time of Contract**
Soundness required at the time of making contract, not before or after.

#### Categories of Unsound Persons

**1. Idiots**
- Permanently defective mind from birth
- Cannot contract at any time

**2. Lunatics**
- Mental illness
- May have lucid intervals
- Can contract during lucid intervals

**Section 12:** "A person who is usually of unsound mind, but occasionally of sound mind, may make a contract when he is of sound mind."

**"A person who is usually of sound mind, but occasionally of unsound mind, may not make a contract when he is of unsound mind."**

**3. Intoxicated Persons**
- Temporarily incapable due to intoxication
- Cannot contract while intoxicated
- Can contract when sober

**4. Persons Under Hypnotism**
Temporarily incapable of understanding.

#### Legal Position

**General Rule:** Contract with unsound person is VOID.

**Rationale:** Cannot give valid consent.

**Case Law: Imperial Loan Co. v. Stone (1892)**
Person so drunk he didn't know what he was doing - contract void.

#### Burden of Proof

**General Presumption:** Every person presumed to be of sound mind.

**Burden on Alleging Party:** Must prove:
1. Unsoundness at time of contract
2. Inability to understand
3. No rational judgment capacity

**Case Law: Inder Singh v. Parmeshwardhari Singh (1957)**
Burden on person alleging unsoundness. Mere eccentricity not enough.

#### Lucid Intervals

**Person usually insane but occasionally sane:**
- Can contract during lucid intervals
- Must prove capacity at that time

**Case Law: Hall v. Warren (1804)**
Contract during lucid interval is valid if person understood transaction.

#### Knowledge of Other Party

**If Other Party Knows:**
Contract void regardless of whether unsound person understood.

**If Other Party Doesn't Know:**
- Contract may be voidable at unsound person's option
- Depends on circumstances

**Case Law: Molton v. Camroux (1849)**
Seller unaware of buyer's insanity - may be liable for necessaries.

#### Necessaries - Section 68

**Similar to Minors:**
- Property (not person) of unsound person liable for necessaries
- Necessaries must be suitable to condition in life

**Case Law: In re Rhodes (1890)**
Mentally ill person supplied with necessaries - supplier entitled to reasonable compensation from property.

#### Drunkenness

**Voluntary Intoxication:**
- Generally not excuse
- But if so drunk cannot understand, contract void

**Case Law: Gore v. Gibson (1845)**
Sale by drunken person for inadequate price - can be set aside if unable to understand and other party aware.

**Involuntary Intoxication:**
- Treated more leniently
- Contract voidable

#### Ratification After Recovery

**If person ratifies after recovery:**
- Contract becomes binding
- Must have full knowledge
- Free consent required

**Case Law: Matthews v. Baxter (1873)**
Ratification by conduct after becoming sober validated contract.

#### Comparison with Minors

| **Aspect** | **Minor** | **Unsound Person** |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Status** | Void ab initio | Void |
| **Ratification** | Not possible | Possible after recovery |
| **Necessaries** | Property liable | Property liable |
| **Knowledge** | Irrelevant | May be relevant |

#### Conclusion
Persons of unsound mind lack capacity to contract as they cannot understand transaction or form rational judgment. The test focuses on mental capacity at time of contracting. Like minors, unsound persons are protected from exploitation, but unlike minors, they can ratify contracts after recovery and contract during lucid intervals. Their property remains liable for necessaries supplied.
