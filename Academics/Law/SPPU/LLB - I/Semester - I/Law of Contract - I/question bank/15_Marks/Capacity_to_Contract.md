# CAPACITY TO CONTRACT – 15 MARKS QUESTIONS

## Question 1: Who are the persons competent to contract under the Indian Contract Act, 1872? Discuss in detail the contractual capacity of minors with the help of decided cases.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Introduction
Capacity to contract is an essential element for the validity of a contract. Not all persons are competent to enter into contracts. The Indian Contract Act, 1872 under Section 11 specifies who can enter into valid contracts. The law protects certain classes of persons who lack the maturity or mental capacity to understand the implications of their agreements.

#### Section 11 - Who Are Competent to Contract

**Section 11 states:**
"Every person is competent to contract who is—
(a) of the age of majority according to the law to which he is subject; and
(b) of sound mind; and
(c) is not disqualified from contracting by any law to which he is subject."

#### Three Classes of Persons Competent to Contract

**1. Person of Age of Majority (Not a Minor)**
**2. Person of Sound Mind**
**3. Person Not Disqualified by Law**

#### Contractual Capacity of Minors

**Who is a Minor?**

According to the **Indian Majority Act, 1875:**
- A person who has not completed 18 years of age is a minor
- Exception: If a guardian is appointed for person or property, minority continues until 21 years

**General Rule:** A minor is incompetent to contract, and any agreement with a minor is VOID AB INITIO (void from the beginning).

#### Landmark Case: Mohori Bibee v. Dharmodas Ghose (1903)

**Facts:**
- Dharmodas Ghose, a minor, mortgaged his property to Brahmo Dutt, a money lender
- The money lender's attorney knew Dharmodas was a minor
- The minor's mother filed a suit to set aside the mortgage
- Brahmo Dutt died, and Mohori Bibee (his widow) continued the case
- Money lender claimed the minor should return the money under Section 64 or Section 65 of the Contract Act

**Issue:**
Whether a contract with a minor is void or merely voidable?

**Held by Privy Council:**
1. A minor's agreement is VOID AB INITIO, not merely voidable
2. The definition of "void agreement" in Section 2(g) includes agreements with minors
3. Section 11 makes it clear that only certain persons can contract, excluding minors
4. Even if minor falsely represents himself as major, the contract remains void
5. Section 64 (restitution on rescission) does not apply as there is no valid contract to rescind
6. Section 65 (obligation to restore benefits) does not apply to void agreements
7. Minor need not restore the money obtained

**Legal Consequences:**
1. Minor's agreements are void from the beginning
2. Minor need not return benefit received
3. Other party cannot enforce contract
4. Minor's property cannot be made liable

**Significance:**
This case is the leading authority on minor's contracts in India and established the principle that minor's agreements are absolutely void.

#### Rules Regarding Minor's Contracts

**Rule 1: Agreement with Minor is Void Ab Initio**

The agreement is void from the very beginning, not voidable at the option of the minor.

**Case Law: Mohori Bibee v. Dharmodas Ghose (1903)**
Established that minor's contracts are void ab initio.

**Rule 2: Minor Cannot Be Asked to Restore Benefits**

Even if minor receives money or goods under void contract, he cannot be compelled to return them.

**Case Law: Mohori Bibee v. Dharmodas Ghose (1903)**
Minor need not return money received under void mortgage.

**Rationale:** To make minor return benefits would indirectly enforce a void contract.

**Rule 3: Minor's Property Cannot Be Made Liable**

Money lender cannot recover money from minor's property even if advanced to minor.

**Case Law: Mohori Bibee v. Dharmodas Ghose (1903)**
Minor's property could not be held liable for mortgage debt.

**Rule 4: No Estoppel Against Minor**

Even if minor fraudulently represents himself as a major and induces the other party to contract, the contract remains void and minor cannot be estopped from pleading minority.

**Case Law: Mohori Bibee v. Dharmodas Ghose (1903)**
Contract void even though lender was deceived about minor's age.

**Case Law: Sadiq Ali Khan v. Jai Kishori (1928)**
Facts: Minor fraudulently represented himself as major and obtained loan by mortgaging property.
Held: Contract void. Minor cannot be estopped. However, minor can be asked to restore specific property if identifiable and still in his possession.

**Rule 5: No Ratification on Attaining Majority**

A void contract cannot become valid by ratification after attaining majority.

**Rationale:** What is void remains void. Ratification means confirming a voidable contract, not a void one.

**Case Law: Suraj Narain Dube v. Sukhu Aheer (1929)**
Facts: Minor executed a promissory note. After attaining majority, he executed a fresh note for same debt.
Held: Fresh promise is without consideration and not enforceable unless it falls under exceptions to Section 25.

**Rule 6: No Specific Performance Against Minor**

Court will not grant specific performance of agreement with or by minor.

**Case Law: Raj Rani v. Prem Adib (1949)**
Facts: Minor's guardian entered into agreement on minor's behalf.
Held: Specific performance cannot be granted against minor as Section 11 prohibits such contracts.

**Rule 7: Minor Can Be a Beneficiary**

Minor can be beneficiary under a contract between two adults.

**Case Law: Chinnaya v. Ramayya (1882)**
Facts: Mother transferred property to daughter who promised to pay annuity to mother's sister (minor's aunt).
Held: Minor aunt can enforce promise even though not party to contract.

**Rule 8: Minor Can Be an Agent**

Section 184 of the Indian Contract Act: A minor can act as an agent, but is not personally liable for his acts.

**Explanation:**
- Minor can bind principal
- Minor himself is not liable to principal or third party
- Principal is liable for minor's acts within authority

**Rule 9: Minor Cannot Be Adjudged Insolvent**

Since minor cannot contract debt, he cannot be declared insolvent.

**Case Law: In re Ramaswami Nadar (1962)**
Madras High Court held minor cannot be adjudicated insolvent.

**Rule 10: No Liability in Tort Arising from Contract**

Minor not liable in tort if action is indirect way of enforcing void contract.

**Case Law: Burnard v. Haggis (1863)**
Facts: Minor hired horse for riding but used it for jumping, resulting in horse's injury.
Held: Minor liable in tort as he exceeded authority and committed independent tortious act.

**Case Law: Leslie v. Sheill (1914)**
Facts: Minor obtained loan by fraudulent misrepresentation about his age.
Held: Action in deceit (tort) could not be brought as it would be indirect way of enforcing void contract.

#### Exceptions and Special Cases

**Exception 1: Contract for Necessaries (Section 68)**

**Section 68 states:**
"If a person, incapable of entering into a contract, or any one whom he is legally bound to support, is supplied by another person with necessaries suited to his condition in life, the person who has furnished such supplies is entitled to be reimbursed from the property of such incapable person."

**Meaning:**
Minor is not personally liable but his property/estate can be held liable for necessaries.

**What are Necessaries?**
Goods or services essential for minor's existence and suitable to his condition in life.

**Includes:**
- Food, clothing, shelter
- Education, medical treatment
- Marriage expenses (in India)
- Legal representation

**Excludes:**
- Luxury items
- Goods beyond minor's station in life
- Goods already adequately supplied

**Case Law: Nash v. Inman (1908)**

Held: Not necessaries as student already had sufficient clothing. Tailor could not recover price.

**Case Law: Ryder v. Wombwell (1868)**
Facts: Minor purchased watch chains and rings.
Held: Not necessaries. Ornaments are luxuries, not necessities.

**Case Law: Chapple v. Cooper (1844)**
Facts: Minor widow ordered funeral for deceased husband.
Held: Funeral expenses are necessaries. Minor's estate liable.

**Indian Position on Necessaries:**

**Peters v. Fleming (1840)**
Expenses incurred for defending minor in criminal prosecution are necessaries.

**Important Points:**
1. Minor not personally liable, only property liable
2. Supplier must prove goods are necessaries
3. Goods must be suitable to minor's condition
4. Minor must not already have sufficient supply

Minor can enter into contract of apprenticeship or service for his benefit with guardian's consent.

**Conditions:**

- Minor not personally liable for firm's debts
- Minor's share can be made liable
- Minor can sue partners for accounts
- Minor can opt to become partner or leave on attaining majority

**Exception 4: Marriage Contract**

Personal law governs marriage. Under some personal laws, minor's marriage may be valid.

**Exception 5: Beneficial Contracts**

Some authorities suggest contracts wholly beneficial to minor may be valid, but this is not settled law in India after Mohori Bibee case.

#### Minor's Liability in Tort

**General Rule:** Minor is liable for torts (civil wrongs).

**Exception:** No liability if tort is indirectly enforcing void contract.

**Case Law: Burnard v. Haggis (1863)**
Minor hired horse for riding only but used for jumping. Horse injured.
Held: Minor liable in tort as it was independent wrongful act.

**Case Law: Johnson v. Pye (1665)**
Minor liable for assault (tort) as it's independent of any contract.

#### Protection Available to Other Party

**1. Restitution of Specific Property**
If identifiable property obtained by fraud is still with minor, it may be recovered.

**Case Law: Sadiq Ali Khan v. Jai Kishori (1928)**
Specific property recovered from minor who obtained it by fraud.

**2. Suit for Money Had and Received**
In some cases, if minor obtained money through fraud and it's traceable, recovery possible.

**3. Indemnity from Guardian**
If guardian authorized minor's contract, guardian may be made liable.

**4. Suing Minor on Attaining Majority**
For fresh consideration given after attaining majority, fresh contract may be enforceable.

#### Comparison: Minor's Position in India vs. England

| **Aspect** | **India** | **England** |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Nature** | Void ab initio | Voidable (some contracts) |
| **Ratification** | Not possible | Possible for voidable contracts |
| **Restitution** | Generally not required | May be ordered under equity |
| **Necessaries** | Property liable, not person | Personal liability possible |
| **Fraud by Minor** | No estoppel | Restitution may be ordered |

#### Conclusion
The law relating to minors' contracts in India is well-settled after the landmark Mohori Bibee case. The law adopts a protective approach, treating all agreements with minors as void ab initio to safeguard minors from exploitation. While this may seem harsh on parties dealing with minors, the law prioritizes the protection of those who lack full contractual capacity. The only exception is for necessaries, where the minor's property (not person) can be held liable. This ensures that while minors are protected from their own improvidence and from exploitation by others, they can still obtain essential goods and services. Understanding these principles is crucial for anyone entering into contracts, particularly in commercial transactions, to ensure that contracts are with competent parties and are therefore enforceable.

## Question 2: Discuss the contractual capacity of persons of unsound mind and persons disqualified by law under the Indian Contract Act, 1872.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Introduction
Apart from minors, two other categories of persons lack full contractual capacity under Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act: persons of unsound mind and persons disqualified by law. The law protects these individuals from entering into contracts they may not fully understand or which may be prejudicial to their interests.

#### Persons of Unsound Mind - Section 12

**Section 12 of the Indian Contract Act states:**
"A person is said to be of sound mind for the purpose of making a contract, if, at the time when he makes it, he is capable of understanding it and of forming a rational judgment as to its effect upon his interests."

"A person who is usually of unsound mind, but occasionally of sound mind, may make a contract when he is of sound mind."

"A person who is usually of sound mind, but occasionally of unsound mind, may not make a contract when he is of unsound mind."

#### Test of Soundness of Mind

**Three Requirements:**
1. **Capacity to Understand:** Person must understand the nature and effect of the contract
2. **Rational Judgment:** Ability to form reasonable judgment about the contract's effect on interests
3. **Soundness at Time of Contract:** Mental soundness required at the time of making contract

#### Categories of Persons of Unsound Mind

**1. Idiots**
- Persons with permanently defective mind from birth
- Lack basic reasoning capacity
- Cannot make contracts at any time

**2. Lunatics**
- Persons who have become of unsound mind due to mental illness
- May have lucid intervals
- Can contract during lucid intervals when of sound mind

**3. Drunken or Intoxicated Persons**
- Temporarily incapable due to intoxication
- Cannot contract while intoxicated
- Can contract when sober

**4. Persons Under Hypnotism**
- Temporarily incapable of understanding
- Contracts during hypnosis may be invalid

**5. Persons with Delusions**
- Have specific delusions but otherwise normal
- Contracts unaffected by delusion are valid
- Contracts related to subject of delusion are void

#### Legal Position of Unsound Person's Contracts

**General Rule:** Contract with person of unsound mind is VOID.

**Rationale:** Such person cannot give valid consent (Section 10 and 11).

**Case Law: Imperial Loan Co. v. Stone (1892)**
Facts: Very drunk man guaranteed loan. Had no recollection of transaction next day.
Held: Contract void. Person so drunk that he didn't know what he was doing cannot be held bound.

**Case Law: Gore v. Gibson (1845)**
Facts: Drunken person sold property for inadequate price.
Held: Sale set aside as person was incapable of understanding transaction.

#### Burden of Proof

**General Presumption:** Every person is presumed to be of sound mind.

**Burden on Party Alleging:** Person alleging unsoundness must prove:
1. Unsoundness of mind
2. At the time of contract
3. Inability to understand contract

**Case Law: Inder Singh v. Parmeshwardhari Singh (1957)**
Facts: Will challenged on ground of testator's unsound mind.
Held: Burden of proof on person alleging unsoundness. Mere eccentricity or strange conduct not sufficient.

**Case Law: Broughton v. Knight (1873)**
Facts: Elderly man's contract challenged as he was of weak mind.
Held: Weakness of intellect not sufficient. Must prove inability to understand transaction.

#### Lucid Intervals

**Principle:** Person usually insane but occasionally sane can contract during lucid intervals when he understands the transaction.

**Requirements to Prove Lucidity:**
1. Mental capacity existed at time of contract
2. Person understood nature and consequences
3. Could form rational judgment

**Case Law: Hall v. Warren (1804)**
Facts: Contract made by lunatic during lucid interval.
Held: Valid if made when person was capable of understanding.

**Illustration from Section 12:**
"A patient in a lunatic asylum, who is at intervals of sound mind, may contract during those intervals."

#### Knowledge of Other Party

**If Other Party Knows About Insanity:**
Contract is void regardless of whether insane person understood it.

**If Other Party Does Not Know:**
- Contract may be voidable at insane person's option
- Or void if insane person could not understand

**Case Law: Molton v. Camroux (1849)**
Facts: Insane person bought goods. Seller unaware of insanity.
Held: Insane person's estate liable if goods were necessaries and seller unaware of insanity.

#### Necessaries for Persons of Unsound Mind - Section 68

**Section 68 applies to:**
- Minors
- Persons of unsound mind
- Persons legally disqualified from contracting

**Liability:** Property (not person) of unsound person liable for necessaries supplied.

**Case Law: In re Rhodes (1890)**
Facts: Mentally ill person supplied with necessaries.
Held: Supplier entitled to reasonable compensation from person's property.

#### Drunkenness and Intoxication

**Types:**
1. **Voluntary Intoxication:** Self-induced
2. **Involuntary Intoxication:** Without knowledge or consent

**Legal Position:**

**Voluntary Intoxication:**
- Generally not an excuse
- But if so drunk that person cannot understand, contract may be void
- Depends on degree of intoxication

**Involuntary Intoxication:**
- Treated more leniently
- Contract voidable if person unable to understand

**Case Law: Gore v. Gibson (1845)**
Facts: Person in drunken state sold property for inadequate consideration.
Held: Sale could be set aside if drunk person unable to understand and other party knew or should have known of intoxication.

**Case Law: Matthews v. Baxter (1873)**
Facts: Drunken person made contract. Later refused to perform when sober.
Held: Contract valid if ratified by conduct after becoming sober.

#### Ratification After Recovery

If person of unsound mind or drunk person ratifies contract after recovery, it becomes binding.

**Requirements:**
1. Ratification when of sound mind
2. Full knowledge of facts
3. Free consent

#### Persons Disqualified by Law

**Section 11(c):** Person disqualified by law to which he is subject cannot contract.

**Categories:**

#### Comparison Table

| **Category** | **Contracts** | **Liability for Necessaries** | **Ratification** |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------------------|------------------|
| **Minor** | Void ab initio | Property liable | Not possible |
| **Insane** | Void | Property liable | Possible after recovery |
| **Drunk** | Void/Voidable | Property liable | Possible when sober |
| **Alien Enemy** | Void | N/A | After war ends |
| **Company (Ultra Vires)** | Void | N/A | Not possible |
| **Insolvent** | Valid but restricted | Normal liability | N/A |

#### Conclusion
The law protects persons of unsound mind and those disqualified by law from entering into contracts that may be detrimental to their interests. The test for soundness of mind focuses on the capacity to understand the contract and form rational judgment at the time of contracting. Persons who are usually insane can contract during lucid intervals, and contracts made by intoxicated persons may be void if they lack understanding. Various classes of persons are disqualified by specific laws for policy reasons, including alien enemies, undischarged insolvents, and companies acting ultra vires. Like minors, unsound persons' property (not person) is liable for necessaries. These provisions balance the need to protect vulnerable persons with the practical reality that they may need to obtain essential goods and services. Understanding these rules is essential for ensuring that contracts are enforceable and that parties have the legal capacity to be bound by their agreements.
