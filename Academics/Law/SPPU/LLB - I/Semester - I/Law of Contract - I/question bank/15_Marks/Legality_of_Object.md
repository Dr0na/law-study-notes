# LEGALITY OF OBJECT – 15 MARKS QUESTIONS

## Question 1: Discuss the provisions relating to legality of object and consideration under Sections 23 and 24 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. When is the object or consideration of an agreement unlawful?

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Introduction
For a contract to be valid and enforceable, its object and consideration must be lawful. An agreement with unlawful object or consideration is void and cannot be enforced by law. Sections 23 and 24 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 deal with the legality of object and consideration, specifying the circumstances under which they become unlawful.

#### Section 23 - Unlawful Object and Consideration

**Section 23 states:**
"The consideration or object of an agreement is lawful, unless—
- it is forbidden by law; or
- is of such a nature that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law; or
- is fraudulent; or
- involves or implies injury to the person or property of another; or
- the Court regards it as immoral, or opposed to public policy.

In each of these cases, the consideration or object of an agreement is said to be unlawful. Every agreement of which the object or consideration is unlawful is void."

#### Six Grounds of Unlawful Object/Consideration

### 1. Forbidden by Law

**Meaning:** Object or consideration expressly prohibited by any law in force in India.

**Examples:**
- Agreement to commit crime (murder, theft, etc.)
- Agreement to sell prohibited drugs
- Agreement for illegal gambling
- Agreement to evade taxes
- Agreement violating FEMA, SEBI regulations

**Case Law: Gherulal Parakh v. Mahadeodas Maiya (1959)**

Facts: Agreement to grant fishing rights in territorial waters without statutory permission.
Held: Void as forbidden by law.

### 2. Defeating the Provisions of Law

**Meaning:** Object or consideration which, though not directly forbidden, would defeat the purpose or provisions of law if permitted.

**Distinction from "Forbidden by Law":**

- Defeating provisions: Indirectly circumventing law

**Examples:**
- Agreement to pay salary below minimum wage (defeats Minimum Wages Act)
- Agreement by insolvent to conceal assets (defeats Insolvency Act)
- Agreement to assign maintenance allowance (defeats purpose of maintenance laws)

**Case Law: Beldar v. Narayanrao (1909)**
Facts: Agreement whereby father promised to pay his son maintenance. Son agreed not to prosecute father for offense. Later, son transferred right to receive maintenance to third party.
Held: Transfer void as it defeats provisions of law that prohibit transfer of maintenance rights. Maintenance is for personal sustenance and cannot be assigned.

**Case Law: Nath v. Radha Kishan (1941)**
Facts: Agreement to oust jurisdiction of courts by arbitration for all future disputes without specifying particular disputes.
Held: Void as it defeats provisions of law giving access to courts.

### 3. Fraudulent Purpose

**Meaning:** Object or consideration involving fraud or intent to defraud others.

**Fraud includes:**
- Deceiving creditors
- Evading taxes
- Obtaining goods by fraud
- False accounting

**Case Law: Chidambaram v. PS Ramanathan Chettiar (1952)**
Facts: Agreement to split firm's profits in manner designed to reduce tax liability through fraudulent accounting.

Facts: Two agreements made - one showing low rent to avoid taxes, another for balance amount.
Held: Both agreements void as object was fraudulent evasion of taxes.

**Illustration:**

**Types of Injury:**
- Physical injury
- Damage to property
- Financial harm
- Reputational damage

Held: Void as it involves injury to justice system and parties to case.

**Case Law: Holman v. Johnson (1775)**
Facts: Agreement to smuggle goods to defraud revenue.
Held: Void as it involves injury to revenue and public.

**Illustration:**
A promises B ₹1 lakh to assault C. Agreement void as it involves injury to person.

### 5. Immoral Agreements

**Meaning:** Agreements that the court regards as immoral, i.e., contrary to accepted standards of morality.

**Examples:**

### 6. Opposed to Public Policy

**Meaning:** Agreements that are harmful to public interest, welfare, or the interests of the community at large.

**Doctrine of Public Policy:**

#### Severability of Illegal Part

**Question:** Can legal part be separated from illegal part and enforced?

**General Rule:** If illegal part can be severed without altering nature of contract, legal part may be enforced.

**Conditions for Severability:**

2. Removal of illegal part doesn't alter nature of contract
3. Parties intended them as separate

**Case Law: Pickering v. Ilfracombe Railway (1868)**

**Case Law: Fisher v. Bridges (1854)**
Money lent to be used for illegal gambling could not be recovered.

#### Comparison: Illegal, Void, and Voidable Agreements

| **Aspect** | **Illegal** | **Void** | **Voidable** |
|------------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| **Enforceability** | Never enforceable | Not enforceable | Enforceable until rescinded |
| **Collateral agreements** | Also void | May be valid | Not affected |
| **Restitution** | Generally not allowed | May be allowed | Allowed on rescission |
| **Examples** | Agreements to commit crime | Agreements with minor | Agreements by coercion |

#### Conclusion
The legality of object and consideration is fundamental to the enforceability of contracts. Sections 23 and 24 of the Indian Contract Act provide comprehensive grounds on which object or consideration may be deemed unlawful - including being forbidden by law, defeating provisions of law, fraudulent, injurious, immoral, or opposed to public policy. The doctrine of public policy is particularly dynamic, evolving with societal norms and judicial interpretation. When even part of the consideration or object is unlawful, the entire agreement becomes void, reflecting the principle that courts will not lend their aid to enforce illegal transactions. This protects the integrity of the legal system and ensures that contract law promotes rather than undermines public welfare. Understanding these provisions is essential for drafting valid contracts and avoiding agreements that, despite mutual consent, cannot be enforced due to illegality of purpose.

## Question 2: "Every agreement in restraint of trade is void." Discuss this statement with reference to Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act and exceptions thereto with case laws.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Introduction
Freedom of trade and profession is a fundamental principle recognized under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 embodies this principle by declaring agreements in restraint of trade to be void. This provision protects individual liberty to carry on any lawful trade or profession and promotes free competition in the market.

#### Section 27 - Restraint of Trade

**Section 27 states:**
"Every agreement by which any one is restrained from exercising a lawful profession, trade or business of any kind, is to that extent void."

**Proviso 1:** Exception one: Saving of agreement not to carry on business of which goodwill is sold.

**Proviso 2:** Exception two: Saving of agreement to refrain from carrying on business during the continuance of a partnership.

**Proviso 3:** Exception three: Saving of agreement among partners not to carry on similar business within specified period after dissolution.

#### Scope and Meaning

**"Restraint":** Any restriction or limitation on freedom to carry on trade.

**"Trade, Profession, or Business":** Includes any lawful occupation, calling, or employment.

**"To That Extent Void":** Only the restrictive portion is void; rest of agreement may be valid if severable.

#### Rationale Behind Section 27

**1. Individual Liberty**
Protect person's right to earn livelihood

**2. Public Interest**
Free trade benefits society through competition

**3. Economic Efficiency**
Competition promotes innovation and efficiency

**4. Constitutional Backing**
Article 19(1)(g) guarantees freedom of trade

**5. Anti-Monopoly**
Prevents creation of monopolies harmful to public

#### Absolute Nature of Section 27

**Indian Law vs. English Law:**

**English Law:** "Rule of Reasonableness"
- Reasonable restraints are valid
- Court examines if restriction is reasonable between parties and in public interest
- Balances interests of parties and public

**Indian Law:** "Absolute Prohibition"
- All restraints void except statutory exceptions
- No doctrine of reasonableness
- Stricter than English law

**Case Law: Madhub Chunder v. Rajcoomar (1874) - Privy Council**
Facts: A, a trader, borrowed money from B and agreed not to carry on trade at all so long as debt remained unpaid. A later started trading. B sued for breach.
Held: Agreement void under Section 27. A could not be restrained even though breach of agreement. Indian law does not recognize doctrine of reasonable restraint.

**Significance:** Established absolute nature of Section 27 in India.

#### Important Case Laws

**1. Niranjan Shankar Golikari v. Century Spinning & Manufacturing Co. (1967) - Supreme Court**
Facts: Company's articles of association contained clause that managing agent or director couldn't be employed by competing company for 5 years after leaving. G was managing agent who resigned. Joined competitor. Company sued for breach.
Held: Clause void under Section 27. Negative covenant restraining person from employment even after termination of service is void. Agreement in restraint of trade cannot be enforced even if entered voluntarily.

**Observations:**
- Section 27 applies to all agreements in restraint of trade
- No distinction between partial and total restraint
- Reasonableness is irrelevant
- Doctrine of restraint of trade is matter of public policy

**2. Gujarat Bottling Co. Ltd. v. Coca Cola Co. (1995) - Supreme Court**
Facts: Exclusive bottling agreement requiring bottler to deal only with Coca Cola. Agreement terminable. After termination, bottler restrained for 3 years from manufacturing similar products.
Held:
- During subsistence of agreement: Restriction valid (not restraint as voluntary partnership)
- Post-termination restriction: Void under Section 27
- Negative covenant operative after termination amounts to restraint of trade

**Principle:** 
- Agreement restricting trade during its operation is not restraint if entered voluntarily
- Post-termination restrictions are restraints and void

**3. Superintendence Co. of India v. Krishna Murgai (1980)**
Facts: Employee agreement containing restrictive covenant not to engage in similar business for 3 years after leaving employment within specified area.
Held: Void under Section 27. Negative covenant restraining former employee is void even if reasonable in time and space.

**4. Percival Ltd. v. LCC (1918)**
Facts: Agreement to supply goods exclusively to Council. Clause preventing supply to others during contract period.
Held: During contract period, restriction valid. Post-contract restriction would be void.

**5. Charlesworth Piling v. Livingston (1990)**
Facts: Employment contract restricting employee from soliciting clients for 1 year after leaving.
Held: Valid in England under reasonableness doctrine. Would be void in India under Section 27.

#### Exceptions to Section 27

### Exception 1: Sale of Goodwill [Proviso 1 to Section 27]

**Proviso states:**
"Save in so far as the buyer of the goodwill of a business may be restrained from carrying on a similar business, within specified local limits, so long as the buyer or any person deriving title to the goodwill from him carries on a like business therein."

**Invalid:** Area unreasonably wide.

### Exception 2: Partnership - During Continuance [Proviso 2]

**Proviso states:**
Partners may agree "not to carry on any business other than that of the firm while he is a partner."

**Meaning:**
Partners can agree among themselves not to engage in competing business while partnership subsists.

**Rationale:**
- Partnership requires mutual trust
- Prevents conflict of interest
- Protects firm's interests

**Validity:**
- Only during partnership
- Post-dissolution restriction not covered here (covered in Exception 3)

**Case Law: Partnership Act, 1932, Section 11**
Partner must carry on business diligently and not compete with firm.

**Illustration:**

**Valid:** Exception 2 applies.

### Exception 3: Partnership - After Dissolution [Proviso 3]

**Proviso states:**
"Partners may agree that some or all of them will not carry on a business similar to that of the firm within such local limits as may be agreed upon, for a specified period after the dissolution of the partnership."

**Conditions:**

**1. Agreement Among Partners**
Must be among partners, not outsiders

**2. Local Limits Specified**
Area must be defined

**3. Specified Period**
Time limit must be mentioned

**4. After Dissolution**
Applies only post-dissolution

**5. Reasonableness**
Restriction should be reasonable (though not explicit in Act, implied)

**Case Law: Vegetable Products v. Shankar (1991)**
Agreement among partners restricting business after dissolution upheld as valid under Exception 3.

**Illustration:**
A, B, and C are partners in restaurant business in Pune. Partnership agreement states that after dissolution, no partner shall open similar restaurant within 10 km radius of current location for 3 years.
**Valid:** Exception 3 applies - local limits and time specified.

**Illustration:**
Same as above, but restriction is "anywhere in Maharashtra for 10 years."
**May be invalid:** Area and time unreasonably wide.

#### What Constitutes "Restraint"

**Direct Restraint:**
Expressly prohibiting person from carrying on trade

**Example:** "Employee shall not join any competing firm."

**Indirect Restraint:**
Provision that effectively restrains though not express prohibition

**Example:** Requiring employee to pay huge penalty if joins competitor.

**Case Law: Niranjan Shankar (1967)**
Negative covenant is restraint even if called by different name.

#### Severability of Restraint Clause

**If restraint clause is severable from rest of agreement:**
- Restraint clause: Void
- Rest of agreement: Valid and enforceable

**If restraint clause is integral:**
- Entire agreement may be void

**Case Law: British Oxygen v. Liquid Air (1925)**
Restraint clause severed; rest of contract enforced.

#### Restraint During Employment

**General Principle:**
Restriction during employment is NOT restraint of trade as person voluntarily chose that employment.

**Post-Employment Restriction:**
Void under Section 27.

**Case Law: Niranjan Shankar (1967)**
During employment: Valid
After leaving employment: Void

#### Exclusive Dealing Agreements

**Question:** Are exclusive dealing agreements restraints of trade?

**Answer:**
- During agreement period: Generally valid (solus agreement)
- Parties voluntarily enter exclusive arrangement
- After termination: Any continuing restriction is void

**Case Law: Gujarat Bottling (1995)**
Exclusivity during contract: Valid
Post-termination restriction: Void

#### Restraint on Employees

**Indian Position - Very Strict:**
- Covenant not to compete after employment: Void
- Covenant not to solicit clients after employment: Void
- Covenant not to use trade secrets: Valid (under Trade Secrets law)
- Covenant not to disclose confidential information: Valid

**Case Law: Niranjan Shankar (1967)**
Non-compete clause for ex-employee void even if reasonable.

**Comparison with England:**
England: Reasonable post-employment restrictions valid if protecting:
- Trade secrets
- Client connections
- Legitimate business interest

**Case Law: Nordenfelt v. Maxim Nordenfelt (1894) - English**
Worldwide restraint on sale of arms business held reasonable and valid in England.

**In India:** Same would be void unless sale of goodwill.

#### Public Policy Considerations

**Policy Favoring Section 27:**
1. Freedom of trade and profession
2. Prevents monopolies
3. Promotes competition
4. Protects livelihood rights
5. Benefits consumers

**Policy Against Strict Application:**
1. May discourage goodwill sales
2. Seller may compete unfairly
3. May harm buyer's investment
4. Limits freedom of contract

**Judicial View:**
Courts consistently uphold strict interpretation, favoring trade freedom over contractual freedom.

#### Conclusion
Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act embodies a strong public policy in favor of freedom of trade and profession. Unlike the English doctrine of reasonableness, Indian law adopts an absolute prohibition against restraints on trade, with only three narrow statutory exceptions relating to sale of goodwill and partnership agreements. The Supreme Court in Niranjan Shankar case definitively established that reasonableness is no defense in India - all restraints are void except those specifically saved by the provisos to Section 27. This rigid approach protects individual liberty to earn a livelihood and prevents creation of monopolies, even at the cost of limiting freedom of contract. While this may seem harsh in some cases, particularly regarding genuine business interests in goodwill and employee covenants, the law prioritizes public policy over private arrangements. Understanding Section 27 is crucial for drafting employment contracts, business sale agreements, and partnership deeds, as any restraint falling outside the three exceptions will be unenforceable, potentially undermining the entire transaction.
