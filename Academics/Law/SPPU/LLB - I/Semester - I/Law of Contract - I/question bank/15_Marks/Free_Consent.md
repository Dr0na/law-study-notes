# FREE CONSENT – 15 MARKS QUESTIONS

## Question 1: "Consent is said to be free when it is not caused by coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake." Explain the concept of free consent with reference to Sections 13, 14, and 15 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Introduction
Free consent is one of the essential elements of a valid contract as per Section 10 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. For an agreement to become a legally binding contract, the consent of the parties must be free and genuine. Without free consent, the agreement becomes either void or voidable. The Act defines consent, free consent, and the factors that vitiate consent in Sections 13, 14, and 15.

#### Section 13 - Definition of Consent

**Section 13 states:**
"Two or more persons are said to consent when they agree upon the same thing in the same sense."

**Meaning:**
- There must be consensus ad idem (meeting of minds)
- Parties must agree on the same subject matter
- Agreement must be in the same sense
- Understanding must be mutual and identical

**Example:**
A offers to sell his white horse to B. B thinks A is selling black horse. No consent as they are not agreeing on same thing.

**Case Law: Raffles v. Wichelhaus (1864)**
Facts: Contract for sale of cotton arriving by ship "Peerless." There were two ships named Peerless, one sailing in October and one in December. Buyer thought October ship, seller meant December ship.
Held: No contract as there was no true consent - parties not agreeing on same thing in same sense.

**Case Law: Scriven Bros. v. Hindley & Co. (1913)**
Facts: Auction of tow and hemp. Buyer bid high price thinking tow was hemp.
Held: No contract. Parties not agreeing on same thing.

#### Section 14 - Definition of Free Consent

**Section 14 states:**
"Consent is said to be free when it is not caused by—
(1) coercion, as defined in section 15, or
(2) undue influence, as defined in section 16, or
(3) fraud, as defined in section 17, or
(4) misrepresentation, as defined in section 18, or
(5) mistake, subject to the provisions of sections 20, 21 and 22."

**Meaning:**
Free consent means consent given voluntarily, with full knowledge and understanding, without any external pressure or deception.

#### Section 15 - Coercion

**Section 15 defines coercion as:**
"Coercion is the committing, or threatening to commit, any act forbidden by the Indian Penal Code, or the unlawful detaining, or threatening to detain, any property, to the prejudice of any person whatever, with the intention of causing any person to enter into an agreement."

**Essential Elements of Coercion:**

**1. Commission or Threat of Act Forbidden by IPC**
- Actual commission of criminal act
- Or threat to commit such act
- Act must be forbidden by Indian Penal Code
- Examples: threat to kill, hurt, falsely prosecute, defame

**2. Unlawful Detention or Threat to Detain Property**
- Actual unlawful detention of property
- Or threat to detain property unlawfully
- Example: "Sign this agreement or I won't return your goods"

**3. Intention to Cause Person to Enter Agreement**
- Coercion must be with intent to make person enter contract
- Must be directed towards inducing consent

**4. Against Any Person**
- Coercion need not be against the contracting party only
- Can be against any person (wife, child, relative, stranger)
- Distinguished from English law (which requires coercion against party or his property)

#### Important Case Laws on Coercion

**1. Ranganayakamma v. Alwar Setti (1889)**
Facts: Money lender detained son of borrower and threatened not to release until father signed promissory note. Father signed.
Held: Contract voidable due to coercion. Detention of son amounts to coercion even though son was not party to contract.

**2. Chikam Amiraju v. Chikam Seshamma (1918)**
Facts: Widow threatened to commit suicide if son did not agree to adopt. Son agreed.
Held: Adoption valid. Threat to commit suicide not coercion as suicide is not an "act" but "omission." IPC punishes attempt to commit suicide, not suicide itself.

**Criticism:** This decision is criticized. Threat to commit suicide should amount to coercion.

**3. Ammiraju v. Seshamma (1917)**
Facts: Person detained until he signed agreement.
Held: Contract voidable at the option of party whose consent was obtained by coercion.

**4. Ast** 

an v. Union of India (1979)**
Facts: Promissory note executed under threat of stopping food supply to family.
Held: Amounts to coercion. Contract voidable.

**5. Muthia v. Karuppan (1920)**
Facts: Manager of estate threatened to dismiss employees if they didn't sign agreement.
Held: Amounted to coercion if threat was of illegal dismissal.

#### Effect of Coercion

**Contract is Voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained by coercion (Section 19).**

**Party can:**
1. **Rescind the contract:** Avoid the contract
2. **Affirm the contract:** Continue with the contract
3. **Claim damages:** If any loss suffered

**Section 19 states:**
"When consent to an agreement is caused by coercion, fraud or misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the party whose consent was so caused."

**Important:** Contract voidable only if consent was "caused by" coercion. If coercion existed but did not induce consent, contract is valid.

#### Burden of Proof in Coercion

**On Party Alleging Coercion:**
- Must prove coercion existed
- Must prove it caused his consent
- Must prove all elements of coercion

**Case Law: Shankarlal Narayan v. Chandrakant (1974)**
Burden of proof on party alleging coercion to prove all essential elements.

#### Difference Between Coercion in Indian and English Law

| **Aspect** | **Indian Law** | **English Law** |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Against whom** | Against any person | Against party or his family |
| **Threat to property** | Covered explicitly | Limited coverage |
| **Definition** | Defined in statute | Developed by courts |
| **Scope** | Wider | Narrower |

#### Illustrations from Section 15

**Illustration (a):**
A, on board an English ship on the high seas, causes B to enter into an agreement by an act amounting to criminal intimidation under the Indian Penal Code.
**Effect:** A employs coercion.

**Illustration (b):**
A threatens to cause B to be arrested under a false charge of theft, unless B signs a promissory note.
**Effect:** Coercion, as false charge is forbidden by IPC.

**Illustration (c):**
A, by detention of B's property, dishonestly obtains B's consent to contract.
**Effect:** Coercion.

#### Practical Examples of Coercion

**Example 1:**
A threatens to file false criminal case against B unless B sells his house for ₹10 lakhs (actual value ₹50 lakhs).
**Effect:** Coercion. Contract voidable at B's option.

**Example 2:**
A threatens to hurt B's daughter unless B agrees to partnership terms.
**Effect:** Coercion (against any person). Contract voidable.

**Example 3:**
Creditor threatens to sue debtor for genuine debt unless debtor agrees to unfavorable terms.
**Effect:** Not coercion. Lawful threat to exercise legal right.

**Example 4:**
Employer threatens wrongful dismissal unless employee signs non-compete agreement.
**Effect:** May amount to coercion if dismissal would be illegal.

#### Related Concepts

**1. Duress (English Law Concept)**
Similar to coercion but narrower in scope. Requires threat of physical violence to person or family.

**2. Economic Duress**
Modern concept where economic pressure vitiates consent. Not explicitly covered in Act but courts may consider under coercion.

**3. Blackmail**
Threatening to reveal secrets unless person contracts. Amounts to coercion as it involves threat of criminal act.

#### Requirement of Causation

**"Caused by" Coercion:**
Consent must be actually caused by coercion. If person would have consented anyway, coercion did not vitiate consent.

**Test:**
"But for" test - But for the coercion, would the person have consented?

**Case Law: Kaufman v. Gerson (1904)**
Facts: Agreement signed under threat but evidence showed person would have signed anyway.
Held: Coercion did not vitiate consent as it did not cause consent.

#### Coercion by Third Party

**Position:**
Contract is voidable even if coercion is by third party, provided:
1. Other party to contract had knowledge of coercion, or
2. Should have had knowledge in circumstances

**Rationale:** Innocent party should not benefit from third party's wrongful act.

#### Lawful Acts as Coercion

**General Rule:** Only unlawful acts or threats amount to coercion.

**Lawful Threats:**
- Threat to sue for genuine claim: Not coercion
- Threat to report genuine crime: Not coercion
- Threat to exercise legal right: Not coercion

**Exception:** Even lawful threat may amount to undue influence if there is relationship of trust.

#### Coercion and Undue Influence Distinguished

| **Coercion** | **Undue Influence** |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Involves threat or force | Involves domination of will |
| Physical or mental pressure | Moral or fiduciary pressure |
| No relationship required | Usually involves relationship |
| Defined precisely in Act | General definition |
| Any criminal act or unlawful detention | Abuse of position of dominance |

#### Rescission and Restitution

**On Rescission (Section 19 and 64):**
1. Contract becomes void
2. Party must restore benefits received
3. Other party must restore what was obtained

**Exception:** If restoration impossible, court may order compensation.

**Section 64:**
When person at whose option contract is voidable rescinds it, other party need not perform promises. Party rescinding must restore benefits received.

**Section 65:**
When agreement is discovered to be void or becomes void or contract is voidable and rescinded, person receiving benefit must restore it or compensate for it.

#### Bar to Rescission (Section 19A)

**Contract cannot be rescinded if:**
1. **Restitution impossible:** Parties cannot be restored to original position
2. **Third party rights:** Bona fide third parties have acquired rights for value
3. **Affirmation:** Party has affirmed contract after coercion ceased
4. **Delay:** Unreasonable delay in rescinding

**Case Law: Prem Raj v. Smt. Phool Bai**
Party who sleeps on his rights cannot later claim rescission.

#### Conclusion
Free consent is fundamental to the validity of a contract. Sections 13, 14, and 15 of the Indian Contract Act establish that consent must be genuine, voluntary, and not obtained through coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake. Coercion involves the use of criminal threats or unlawful detention of property to force a person into a contract. The Indian law on coercion is more comprehensive than English law, as it protects against threats to any person, not just the contracting party. When consent is obtained by coercion, the contract becomes voidable at the option of the aggrieved party, who may rescind it and seek restoration of benefits. However, this right is subject to certain bars such as impossibility of restitution, third party rights, affirmation, and undue delay. Understanding the concept of coercion is essential for identifying invalid contracts and protecting parties from exploitation and unfair dealing.

## Question 2: Distinguish between coercion and undue influence. Explain the doctrine of undue influence with reference to Section 16 of the Indian Contract Act and decided cases.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Introduction
Both coercion and undue influence are factors that vitiate free consent under Section 14 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. While both involve obtaining consent through improper means, they differ fundamentally in their nature, application, and legal consequences. Undue influence is particularly important in relationships involving trust and confidence.

#### Section 16 - Undue Influence

**Section 16(1) states:**
"A contract is said to be induced by 'undue influence' where the relations subsisting between the parties are such that one of the parties is in a position to dominate the will of the other and uses that position to obtain an unfair advantage over the other."

**Section 16(2) states:**
"In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing principle, a person is deemed to be in a position to dominate the will of another where—
(a) he holds a real or apparent authority over the other, or where he stands in a fiduciary relation to the other; or
(b) he makes a contract with a person whose mental capacity is temporarily or permanently affected by reason of age, illness, or mental or bodily distress."

**Section 16(3) states:**
"Where a person who is in a position to dominate the will of another, enters into a contract with him, and the transaction appears, on the face of it or on the evidence adduced, to be unconscionable, the burden of proving that such contract was not induced by undue influence shall lie upon the person in a position to dominate the will of the other."

#### Essential Elements of Undue Influence

**1. Position to Dominate Will**
- One party must be in position to dominate will of other
- Domination of will, not merely influence
- Actual subjugation of will

**2. Use of Position**
- Dominant party must use that position
- Must obtain unfair advantage
- Advantage must be unconscionable

**3. Relationship or Circumstances**
Either:
- Relationship involving authority/trust, or
- Weak mental capacity due to age, illness, distress

#### When Undue Influence is Presumed - Section 16(2)

**Category 1: Relationships Involving Authority or Trust**

**Relationships where undue influence is presumed:**
1. **Parent and child**
2. **Guardian and ward**
3. **Trustee and beneficiary**
4. **Doctor and patient**
5. **Lawyer and client**
6. **Spiritual advisor and devotee**
7. **Teacher and student**
8. **Fiduciary relationships**

**Important:** Burden shifts to dominant party to prove no undue influence.

**Category 2: Impaired Mental Capacity**
- Aged persons
- Persons of weak mind
- Persons in mental distress
- Persons in physical distress
- Persons in illness

#### Important Case Laws on Undue Influence

**1. Williams v. Bayley (1866)**
Facts: Son forged father's name on promissory notes. Banker threatened to prosecute son unless father mortgaged property to secure debt. Father mortgaged property.
Held: Contract vitiated by undue influence. Banker used his position to dominate father's will who was in mental distress.

**5. Ranganayakamma v. Alwar Setti (1889)**
Facts: Money lender detained borrower's son. Father executed promissory note.
Held: Both coercion and undue influence. Detention amounts to coercion. Using distress of father is undue influence.

**6. Raghunath Prasad v. Sarju Prasad (1924) - Privy Council**
Facts: Spiritual advisor obtained property from devotee.
Held: Presumption of undue influence. Guru-disciple relationship. Burden on guru to prove no undue influence.

**7. Kuppa Vamma v. Ramaswami (1926)**
Facts: Woman in severe mental distress due to husband's death executed sale deed.
Held: Sale set aside. Woman was in mental distress. Purchaser failed to prove no undue influence.

#### Burden of Proof - Section 16(3)

**General Rule:** Party alleging undue influence must prove it.

**Exception - Burden Shifts:**
When person in dominant position makes contract AND transaction appears unconscionable, burden shifts to dominant party to prove no undue influence.

**Requirements for Burden to Shift:**
1. Dominant position exists
2. Contract entered between parties
3. Transaction appears unconscionable or suspicious

**What is Unconscionable Transaction?**
- Unfair or unreasonable
- One-sided benefit
- Improvident (rash, without proper consideration)
- Suspicious circumstances

**Case Law: Mannu Singh v. Umadat Pandey (1890)**
Transaction with pardanashin woman - burden on other party to prove fairness.

#### Examples of Undue Influence

**Example 1: Doctor-Patient**
Doctor persuades seriously ill patient to sell property at undervalue to pay medical bills.
**Effect:** Undue influence presumed. Doctor must prove fairness.

**Example 2: Guardian-Ward**
Guardian induces minor ward to transfer property for inadequate consideration.
**Effect:** Undue influence. Burden on guardian to prove no undue influence.

**Example 3: Religious Advisor**
Spiritual guru obtains large donations from devotee.
**Effect:** May be undue influence if unconscionable. Burden on guru.

**Example 4: Elderly Parent**
Aged father in poor health transfers property to son who cares for him.
**Effect:** May be scrutinized for undue influence, especially if other family members excluded.

#### Protection Against Undue Influence

**1. Independent Legal Advice**
Party in weak position should receive independent legal advice.

**Case Law: Inche Noriah v. Shaik Allie Bin Omar (1929)**
Absence of independent advice indicated undue influence.

**2. Full Disclosure**
All material facts must be disclosed.

**3. Fair Terms**
Transaction must be fair and reasonable.

**4. No Pressure**
Decision must be voluntary, with time to consider.

#### Distinction Between Coercion and Undue Influence

| **Basis** | **Coercion (Section 15)** | **Undue Influence (Section 16)** |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Nature** | Physical or criminal force | Moral or mental pressure |
| **Method** | Threat or actual commission of crime | Domination of will through position |
| **Relationship** | No relationship required | Usually involves relationship of trust |
| **Against whom** | Against any person | Against party to contract |
| **Scope** | Precisely defined | Broadly defined |
| **Penalty** | Involves criminal acts (IPC) | Does not involve crime |
| **Proof** | Party alleging must prove | May be presumed; burden shifts |
| **Example** | Threat to kill unless contract signed | Lawyer persuading client to sign unfair contract |
| **Detention** | Unlawful detention of property | Using position of authority |
| **Consent** | Obtained by fear | Obtained by domination |
| **Effect** | Contract voidable | Contract voidable |

#### Effect of Undue Influence

**Contract is voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained by undue influence.**

**Section 19A - Bars to Rescission:**
Same as for coercion:
1. Impossibility of restitution
2. Third party rights
3. Affirmation
4. Undue delay

**Section 19 - Alternative Relief:**
Court may set aside contract or modify it on just terms.

**Special Feature:**
Unlike coercion and fraud, court has discretion to:
- Set aside entire contract, or
- Modify terms to make them fair, or
- Direct party to return excessive benefit

**Illustration:**
Money lender obtains promissory note for ₹10 lakhs from borrower in distress when actual loan was ₹5 lakhs. Court may modify note to ₹5 lakhs plus reasonable interest instead of setting aside entirely.

#### Pardanashin Women - Special Protection

**Definition:** Women in strict seclusion, not accustomed to business affairs.

**Legal Protection:**
Courts presume undue influence in transactions with pardanashin women.

**Requirements to Uphold Transaction:**
1. Explained by independent person
2. Woman understood implications
3. Acting of her own free will
4. Transaction fair and reasonable

**Case Law: Hira Lal v. Kali Prasad**
Heavy burden on person dealing with pardanashin woman to prove fairness and understanding.

#### Active and Passive Undue Influence

**Active Undue Influence:**
Dominant party actively uses position to obtain unfair advantage.

**Example:** Doctor threatening to withdraw treatment unless patient transfers property.

**Passive Undue Influence:**
Dominant party does not actively coerce but relationship itself creates unfair influence.

**Example:** Devoted disciple voluntarily giving property to guru under influence of relationship.

**Case Law: Allcard v. Skinner (1887)**
Facts: Woman joined religious order, took vow of poverty, gave property to order. Left order after many years and claimed property back.
Held: Gift made under undue influence of relationship, though no active pressure. However, claim barred by delay.

#### Relationship Between Undue Influence and Other Vitiating Factors

**Undue Influence vs. Fraud:**
- Undue influence: Domination of will
- Fraud: Deliberate misrepresentation
- Both make contract voidable

**Undue Influence vs. Misrepresentation:**
- Undue influence: Pressure through relationship
- Misrepresentation: False statement of fact
- Both make contract voidable

**Overlap:**
Same transaction may involve multiple vitiating factors.

**Example:** Religious advisor may use both fraud (misrepresenting benefits of donation) and undue influence (using spiritual authority).

#### Safeguards in Practice

**For Professionals (Lawyers, Doctors, etc.):**
1. Advise client to seek independent advice
2. Ensure terms are fair
3. Full disclosure of all facts
4. Document that client understood
5. Avoid transactions during crisis

**For Family Members:**
1. Ensure elderly/ill person has independent advice
2. Involve other family members
3. Document soundness of mind
4. Ensure adequate consideration
5. No pressure or urgency

**For Banks and Lenders:**
1. Ensure guarantor has independent advice
2. Explain nature of transaction
3. Verify understanding
4. Fair terms
5. No exploitation of distress

#### Conclusion
Undue influence is a subtle vitiating factor that operates through domination of will rather than physical force. It recognizes that consent may be impaired not only by violence or fraud but also by psychological pressure arising from relationships of trust and authority. The law presumes undue influence in certain relationships and shifts the burden of proof to the dominant party, particularly when transactions appear unconscionable. This protects vulnerable persons such as pardanashin women, elderly persons, patients, and those in fiduciary relationships from exploitation. The distinction between coercion and undue influence lies in the method - coercion uses criminal threats while undue influence uses position of dominance. Courts have wide discretion in cases of undue influence to either set aside contracts entirely or modify them on just terms. Understanding undue influence is crucial for professionals, family members, and anyone in a position of trust to ensure that contracts are fair and that vulnerable persons are protected from exploitation.
