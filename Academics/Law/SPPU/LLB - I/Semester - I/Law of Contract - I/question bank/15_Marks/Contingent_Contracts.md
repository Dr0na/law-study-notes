# CONTINGENT CONTRACTS – 15 MARKS QUESTIONS

## Question 1: Define contingent contract. Explain the rules regarding enforcement and performance of contingent contracts under Sections 31 to 36 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Introduction
Contingent contracts are agreements where the performance of the promise depends upon the happening or non-happening of a specified uncertain future event. These contracts are common in business transactions, insurance, indemnity, and guarantee. The Indian Contract Act, 1872 provides detailed provisions in Sections 31 to 36 regarding the nature, validity, and enforcement of contingent contracts.

#### Definition of Contingent Contract - Section 31

**Section 31 states:**
"A 'contingent contract' is a contract to do or not to do something, if some event, collateral to such contract, does or does not happen."

**Essential Elements:**

**1. Contract to Do or Not to Do**
- Must be a valid contract
- Performance depends on condition

**2. Uncertain Future Event**
- Event must be uncertain
- May or may not happen

**3. Event Collateral to Contract**
- Event must be collateral (incidental/additional) to main contract
- Not the main subject matter of contract

**Illustration (a) from Section 31:**
A makes a contract with B to buy B's horse if A survives C. This is a contingent contract.

**Illustration (b) from Section 31:**
A makes a contract with B to sell a horse to B at a specified price, if C to whom the horse has been offered, refuses to buy him. Contract is contingent.

#### Distinction: Contingent Contract vs. Wagering Agreement

| **Contingent Contract** | **Wagering Agreement** |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| May or may not involve mutual promises | Always involves mutual promises |
| Parties have interest beyond stake | Parties have no interest except stake |
| Event is collateral | Event is the essence |
| Valid contract | Void under Section 30 |
| Example: Insurance | Example: Betting on match |

**Case Law: Mahadeo Parshad v. Parmeshwar Sahai (1963)**
Insurance is contingent contract, not wager, as insurable interest exists.

#### Types of Contingent Events

**1. Happening of Uncertain Future Event**
Contract depends on event occurring.

**2. Non-happening of Uncertain Future Event**
Contract depends on event NOT occurring.

**3. Conduct of Living Person**
Contract depends on how a person acts.

**4. Impossibility of Event**
Contract depends on impossible event.

#### Rules for Enforcement of Contingent Contracts

### Rule 1: Contingent on Happening of Event [Section 32]

**Section 32 states:**
"Contingent contracts to do or not to do anything if an uncertain future event happens cannot be enforced by law unless and until that event has happened.

If the event becomes impossible, such contracts become void."

**Two Parts:**

**Part 1: Enforcement**
Contract can be enforced only when event happens.

**Part 2: Impossibility**
If event becomes impossible, contract becomes void.

**Illustration from Section 32:**
A makes a contract with B to buy B's horse if A survives C.
- Contract can be enforced only if A survives C
- If A dies before C, contract becomes void (survival impossible)

**Example 1:**
A agrees to pay B ₹10 lakhs if B's ship arrives safely from England.
- Enforceable only when ship arrives safely
- If ship sinks, contract becomes void (safe arrival impossible)

**Example 2:**
X agrees to marry Y if X passes law examination.
- Enforceable only if X passes
- If examination abolished, contract may become void

**Case Law: Avtar Singh v. Kartar Singh (1970)**
Contract contingent on happening of event cannot be enforced until event occurs.

### Rule 2: Contingent on Non-happening of Event [Section 33]

**Section 33 states:**
"Contingent contracts to do or not to do anything if an uncertain future event does not happen can be enforced when the happening of that event becomes impossible, and not before."

**Key Point:**
Contract enforceable when it becomes certain that event will NOT happen.

**Illustration from Section 33:**
A agrees to pay B a sum of money if a certain ship does not return.
- Ship is sunk
- Contract can be enforced when news of sinking is received (return impossible)

**Example 1:**
A promises to pay B ₹5 lakhs if C does not marry D.
- Enforceable only when:
  - C dies (marriage to D now impossible), or
  - D dies (marriage to D now impossible), or
  - C marries someone else (marriage to D impossible while C is married)

**Example 2:**
Insurance company agrees to pay if fire does NOT destroy building in next 5 years.
- Enforceable when 5 years pass without fire
- If fire occurs, contract becomes void

**Example 3:**
A promises to employ B if C does not return from abroad within 6 months.
- If C returns: contract void
- If 6 months pass and C doesn't return: contract enforceable
- If C dies before 6 months: contract immediately enforceable (return impossible)

### Rule 3: Contingent on Conduct of Living Person [Section 34]

**Section 34 states:**
"If the future event on which a contract is contingent is the way in which a person will act at an unspecified time, the event shall be considered to become impossible when such person does anything which renders it impossible that he should so act within any definite time, or otherwise than under further contingencies."

**Meaning:**
If contract depends on how a person will act in future, contract becomes void when that person does something making the specified action impossible.

**Illustration from Section 34:**
A agrees to pay B a sum of money if B marries C.
- C marries D
- Marriage of B to C now impossible
- Contract becomes void

**Example 1:**
A agrees to lease property to B if B sets up factory in that area.
- B purchases factory in another area and sets up business there
- Setting up factory in first area now unlikely/impossible
- Contract may become void

**Example 2:**
Company agrees to employ A if A obtains MBA degree.
- A joins another company on permanent basis
- Obtaining MBA becomes unlikely (working full-time)
- Contract may become void depending on circumstances

**Case Law: Frost v. Knight (1872)**
Facts: Man promised to marry woman after his father's death. He broke engagement during father's lifetime by marrying another woman.
Held: Woman could sue immediately. Man's action made future marriage impossible.

### Rule 4: Contingent on Happening Within Fixed Time [Section 35]

**Section 35 states:**
"Contingent contracts to do or not to do anything if a specified uncertain event happens within a fixed time become void if, at the expiration of the time fixed, such event has not happened, or if, before the time fixed, such event becomes impossible."

**Two Situations:**

**Situation 1: Time Expires Without Event**
Contract becomes void when time limit expires without event occurring.

**Situation 2: Event Becomes Impossible Before Time**
Contract becomes void when event becomes impossible, even before time limit.

**Illustration from Section 35:**
A promises to pay B a sum of money if a certain ship returns within a year.
- Contract may be enforced if ship returns within year
- Contract becomes void:
  - If year expires and ship has not returned, or
  - If ship is burnt within year (return impossible)

**Example 1:**
A agrees to buy B's car if B wins lottery within 6 months.
- If 6 months pass and B doesn't win: contract void
- If lottery is cancelled before 6 months: contract void

**Example 2:**
X promises to pay Y ₹10 lakhs if Y's film releases within 1 year.
- If 1 year passes without release: contract void
- If film is banned before 1 year: contract void

### Rule 5: Contingent on Non-happening Within Fixed Time [Section 35]

**Section 35 (Second Part) states:**
"Contingent contracts to do or not to do anything if a specified uncertain event does not happen within a fixed time may be enforced by law when the time fixed has expired and such event has not happened or, before the time fixed has expired, if it becomes certain that such event will not happen."

**Two Situations for Enforcement:**

**Situation 1: Time Expires Without Event**
Contract becomes enforceable when time expires and event has not happened.

**Situation 2: Event Becomes Impossible Before Time**
Contract becomes immediately enforceable when it becomes certain event won't happen.

**Illustration from Section 35:**
A promises to pay B a sum of money if a certain ship does not return within a year.
- Contract may be enforced:
  - If ship does not return within year, or
  - If ship is burnt within year (return impossible)

**Example 1:**
Insurance for 5 years against fire. Insurer pays if fire does NOT occur in 5 years.
- Enforceable when 5 years pass without fire
- If building demolished before 5 years, contract may become void (no building to insure)

**Example 2:**
A promises to give property to B if C does not return from USA within 2 years.
- If 2 years pass and C doesn't return: contract enforceable
- If C dies in USA after 1 year: contract immediately enforceable (return impossible)

### Rule 6: Contingent on Impossible Events [Section 36]

**Section 36 states:**
"Contingent agreements to do or not to do anything if an impossible event happens are void, whether the impossibility of the event is known to the parties or not."

**Key Points:**

**1. Event Impossible from Beginning**
If event was impossible when contract made, contract is void ab initio.

**2. Knowledge Irrelevant**
Doesn't matter whether parties knew of impossibility.

**Types of Impossibility:**

**a) Physical Impossibility**
Inherently impossible in nature.

**b) Legal Impossibility**
Impossible due to law.

**Illustration from Section 36:**
A agrees to pay B ₹10,000 if B will marry A's daughter C.
- C was dead at time of agreement
- Agreement void (event impossible)

**Example 1:**
A agrees to pay B if B makes water flow uphill by natural means.
**Result:** Physically impossible, contract void.

**Example 2:**
A agrees to pay B if B's father (who died 10 years ago) returns.
**Result:** Impossible event, contract void.

**Example 3:**
A agrees to employ B if B obtains license for business that law has prohibited.
**Result:** Legally impossible, contract void.

**Case Law: Maddison v. Alderson (1883)**
Agreement to transfer property on happening of impossible event is void.

#### Important Case Laws on Contingent Contracts

**1. Taraporewalla v. Framroze (1905)**
Facts: Agreement to sell property if purchaser obtained necessary funds from certain source.
Held: Contingent contract. Enforceable only when condition fulfilled.

**2. Mahadeo Parshad v. Parmeshwar Sahai (1963)**
Facts: Life insurance policy.
Held: Contingent contract depending on death of insured. Valid, not wager, as insurable interest exists.

**3. Frost v. Knight (1872)**
Facts: Promise to marry after father's death. Man married another woman during father's lifetime.
Held: Contingent condition became impossible. Woman could sue immediately for breach.

**4. Pramatha Nath v. Pradyamna Kumar (1925) - Privy Council**
Facts: Sale of immovable property contingent on approval of court. Court approval not obtained due to plaintiff's conduct.
Held: Plaintiff prevented fulfillment of condition. Cannot claim benefit. Defendant entitled to refund of advance.

#### Practical Applications of Contingent Contracts

**1. Insurance Contracts**
Life insurance: Payment contingent on death
Fire insurance: Payment contingent on fire occurring

**2. Indemnity Contracts**
Indemnifier promises to compensate if loss occurs.

**3. Guarantee**
Guarantor liable if principal debtor defaults.

**4. Sale Contracts**
Sale contingent on buyer obtaining finance.

**5. Employment Contracts**
Employment contingent on candidate passing medical exam.

**6. Real Estate**
Sale contingent on approvals, clear title, or buyer selling existing property.

#### Distinction: Contingent Contract vs. Wagering Agreement

| **Aspect** | **Contingent Contract** | **Wagering Agreement** |
|------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| **Validity** | Valid (Section 31) | Void (Section 30) |
| **Interest** | Parties have genuine interest | Interest only in stake |
| **Reciprocity** | May not be mutual | Always mutual |
| **Event** | Collateral to contract | Event is essence |
| **Purpose** | Legitimate business purpose | Speculation/gambling |
| **Example** | Life insurance | Betting on match |

**Case Law: Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. (1893)**
Reward offer is contingent contract, not wager.

#### Distinction: Contingent Contract vs. Condition

**Condition:**
- Part of contract itself
- Affects formation or performance of contract
- May be condition precedent or condition subsequent

**Contingent Contract:**
- Separate from main contract
- Performance depends on external event
- Event is collateral

**Example of Condition Precedent:**
"I will sell you my car provided you pay ₹5 lakhs in cash."
Payment is condition precedent to sale.

**Example of Contingent Contract:**
"I will sell you my car if my ship arrives safely."
Ship's arrival is contingent event, collateral to sale.

#### Performance of Contingent Contracts - Summary

**Summary Table:**

| **Type** | **Section** | **When Enforceable** | **When Void** |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Event happens | 32 | When event happens | When event becomes impossible |
| Event doesn't happen | 33 | When event becomes impossible | When event happens |
| Conduct of person | 34 | When specified conduct occurs | When conduct becomes impossible |
| Event within time | 35 | When event happens within time | Time expires OR event impossible |
| Event doesn't happen within time | 35 | Time expires without event OR event impossible before time | When event happens |
| Impossible event | 36 | Never | Void from beginning |

#### Illustrations - Practical Examples

**Example 1: Insurance (Section 32)**
Fire insurance for building. Insurer pays if fire occurs.
- Contingent on happening of event (fire)
- Enforceable when fire occurs
- If policy period ends without fire, contract fulfilled (no payment due)

**Example 2: Guarantee (Section 32)**
A guarantees B's debt to C. A pays if B defaults.
- Contingent on B's default (happening of event)
- Enforceable when B defaults
- If B pays fully, guarantee not invoked

**Example 3: Sale of Property (Section 35)**
A agrees to sell property to B if B obtains bank loan within 3 months.
- Contingent on event within fixed time
- Enforceable if B obtains loan within 3 months
- Void if 3 months pass without loan
- Void if B's loan application rejected before 3 months

**Example 4: Employment (Section 34)**
Company offers job to A if A obtains Ph.D.
- Contingent on A's conduct
- Enforceable when A obtains Ph.D.
- Void if A takes permanent job elsewhere, making Ph.D. unlikely

**Example 5: Impossible Event (Section 36)**
A promises to pay B if B brings back person who died 5 years ago.
- Impossible event
- Contract void from beginning

#### Conclusion
Contingent contracts form an essential part of modern commercial transactions, allowing parties to structure agreements based on uncertain future events. The Indian Contract Act provides a comprehensive framework under Sections 31 to 36 for determining when such contracts become enforceable or void. The key principle is that a contingent contract depends on the occurrence or non-occurrence of an uncertain future event that is collateral to the contract itself. The Act distinguishes between different types of contingent events - those that must happen, those that must not happen, those involving conduct of persons, those with time limits, and those that are impossible. Understanding these provisions is crucial for drafting and enforcing insurance contracts, guarantees, conditional sales, and various other commercial agreements where performance depends on external circumstances. The law ensures that while parties can structure their obligations based on uncertain events, such contracts must be based on possible events and become void when the contingency can never be fulfilled.

## Question 2: Distinguish between contingent contracts and wagering agreements. Explain with examples how contingent contracts are different from contracts with conditions.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Introduction
Contingent contracts, wagering agreements, and contracts with conditions all involve elements of uncertainty, but they are fundamentally different in nature, purpose, and legal treatment. While contingent contracts are valid and enforceable under Sections 31-36 of the Indian Contract Act, wagering agreements are void under Section 30. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for determining the validity and enforceability of agreements.

#### Definitions

**Contingent Contract (Section 31):**
"A contract to do or not to do something, if some event, collateral to such contract, does or does not happen."

**Wagering Agreement:**
An agreement between two parties where each promises to pay money or give something of value to the other based on outcome of an uncertain event, where parties have no interest except the stake.

**Condition:**
A term or clause in a contract that affects the formation, performance, or enforceability of the contract.

#### Detailed Distinction: Contingent Contract vs. Wagering Agreement

### 1. Nature and Purpose

**Contingent Contract:**
- Legitimate business transaction
- Based on genuine commercial interest
- Parties have real interest in subject matter beyond stake
- Risk management tool
- Purpose: Protect against loss or provide for uncertain events

**Wagering Agreement:**
- Speculative/gambling transaction
- Based on mere chance
- Parties have no interest except winning/losing stake
- Gambling tool
- Purpose: Win money by betting on event outcome

### 2. Interest in Subject Matter

**Contingent Contract:**
- Parties have genuine interest in subject matter
- Interest exists independent of the contract
- Examples:
  - Insured has interest in insured property
  - Seller has interest in selling goods if conditions met
  - Employer has interest in hiring qualified candidate

**Wagering Agreement:**
- No interest in subject matter except stake
- Interest created only because of bet
- Examples:
  - Betting on cricket match (bettors have no interest in teams)
  - Betting on rainfall (bettors have no property affected by rain)
  - Betting on election results (bettors have no stake except bet)

**Illustration:**

**Contingent Contract:**
A owns a house. A contracts with insurance company: Company pays ₹50 lakhs if house burns.
- A has insurable interest in house
- Company has business interest in collecting premiums and managing risk
- Both have genuine interests beyond the payment

**Wagering Agreement:**
A and B bet ₹10,000 on whether C's house will burn.
- Neither A nor B owns C's house
- Neither has any interest except the ₹10,000 stake
- Pure speculation

### 3. Mutuality

**Contingent Contract:**
- May or may not be reciprocal
- Often one-sided promise
- Example: Insurance - only insurer promises payment; insured just pays premium

**Wagering Agreement:**
- Always mutual promises
- Both parties stand to win or lose
- Reciprocal stakes
- One's gain is exactly other's loss (zero-sum)

**Example:**

**Contingent (Not Mutual):**
Fire insurance: Insurer pays if fire occurs. Insured doesn't pay more if fire doesn't occur (just premium already paid).

**Wager (Mutual):**
A and B bet on match. A pays if India wins. B pays if Pakistan wins. Both have opposite stakes.

### 4. Legal Status

**Contingent Contract:**
- Valid and enforceable (Section 31)
- Courts will enforce when conditions met
- Protected by law

**Wagering Agreement:**
- Void (Section 30)
- Not enforceable by law
- Cannot sue to recover winnings
- Against public policy

### 5. Event's Relationship to Contract

**Contingent Contract:**
- Event is collateral (incidental) to contract
- Contract has independent purpose
- Event merely determines when/if performance occurs
- Example: Sale of goods contingent on obtaining finance - sale is main purpose, finance is collateral condition

**Wagering Agreement:**
- Event is the very essence of agreement
- No purpose except betting on event
- Entire agreement revolves around event outcome
- Example: Betting on match - the match result IS the entire purpose

### 6. Types of Parties

**Contingent Contract:**
- Can be between any parties with genuine interest
- Parties have different roles (insurer-insured, buyer-seller)
- Parties may not have opposite views

**Wagering Agreement:**
- Always between parties with opposite views about event
- Both are speculators
- Roles are symmetrical (both are bettors)

### 7. Effect on Society

**Contingent Contract:**
- Beneficial to society
- Facilitates commerce
- Risk management tool
- Promotes economic activity
- Examples: Insurance protects people and businesses

**Wagering Agreement:**
- Harmful to society
- Encourages gambling
- No productive purpose
- Wastes resources
- Against public policy

### 8. Regulatory Framework

**Contingent Contract:**
- Regulated as legitimate business
- Insurance regulated by IRDAI
- Guarantees governed by Contract Act
- Futures/options regulated by SEBI

**Wagering Agreement:**
- Prohibited under Section 30
- Criminal laws against gambling
- No regulatory protection

#### Comparison Table

| **Aspect** | **Contingent Contract** | **Wagering Agreement** |
|------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| **Legal Status** | Valid (Section 31) | Void (Section 30) |
| **Interest** | Genuine interest in subject matter | No interest except stake |
| **Purpose** | Business/protective purpose | Speculation/gambling |
| **Mutuality** | May be one-sided | Always mutual |
| **Event** | Collateral to contract | Essence of agreement |
| **Opposite Views** | Not necessary | Must have opposite views |
| **Enforceability** | Enforceable when conditions met | Never enforceable |
| **Social Utility** | Beneficial (risk management) | Harmful (gambling) |
| **Examples** | Insurance, guarantee, conditional sale | Betting on sports, dice games |
| **Recovery** | Can sue for payment when due | Cannot sue to recover winnings |

#### Important Case Laws

**1. Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. (1893)**
Facts: Company offered ₹100 reward to anyone using smoke ball as directed and still getting flu. Mrs. Carlill used it, got flu, claimed reward. Company argued it was wager.
Held: Not a wager but contingent contract. Company had commercial interest in promoting product, not mere speculation. Unilateral offer for consideration.

**2. Mahadeo Parshad v. Parmeshwar Sahai (1963)**
Facts: Life insurance policy. Question whether it was wager.
Held: Life insurance is contingent contract, not wager. Insurable interest exists. Insured has interest in his own life. Purpose is protection of dependents, not speculation.

**3. Dayabhai Tribhobandas v. LIC (1971)**
Facts: Validity of life insurance as contingent contract.
Held: Insurance contracts are valid contingent contracts. Insurable interest distinguishes them from wagers. Insurance serves social and economic purpose.

**4. Gherulal Parakh v. Mahadeodas Maiya (1959)**
Facts: Forward contract for sale of gur (jaggery).
Held: Genuine speculative business transactions with intention to perform are contingent contracts, not wagers. Parties had business interest in actual commodity.

#### Detailed Distinction: Contingent Contract vs. Contract with Condition

### 1. Definition

**Contingent Contract:**
Entire contract depends on happening or non-happening of uncertain future event that is collateral to the contract.

**Contract with Condition:**
Contract exists, but a particular term or clause affects its formation, performance, or continuance.

### 2. Formation

**Contingent Contract:**
- Contract exists from beginning but performance is suspended
- Valid contract already formed
- Example: "I will pay you ₹10 lakhs if my ship arrives" - contract exists now, payment contingent

**Condition Precedent:**
- Contract comes into existence only when condition fulfilled
- No contract until condition met
- Example: "I will buy your car if you get it repaired" - no contract until repair done

### 3. Effect on Contract

**Contingent Contract:**
- Affects timing/certainty of performance
- Contract's enforceability depends on external event
- Event is external to contractual relationship

**Condition:**
- Affects existence or obligations under contract
- May be part of contractual relationship itself
- Event may be action by one of the parties

### 4. Nature of Event

**Contingent Contract:**
- Event is always external and collateral
- Not in control of either party
- Examples: Ship arriving, person surviving, fire occurring

**Condition:**
- May be action by one of the parties
- May be within party's control
- Examples: Payment of price, delivery of goods, obtaining approval

### 5. Types

**Contingent Contracts:**
Classified by nature of event (Sections 31-36):
- Contingent on happening of event
- Contingent on non-happening
- Contingent on conduct
- Within fixed time
- Impossible events

**Conditions:**
Classified by effect on contract:
- **Condition Precedent:** Must be fulfilled before contract or obligation arises
- **Condition Subsequent:** Terminates existing contract
- **Condition Concurrent:** Both parties must perform simultaneously

### 6. Control Over Event

**Contingent Contract:**
- Event generally beyond parties' control
- External circumstances
- Example: Whether it rains, whether ship arrives safely

**Condition:**
- May be within one party's control
- Party may need to take action
- Example: Buyer obtaining loan, seller obtaining clearance

### 7. Legal Provisions

**Contingent Contract:**
- Governed by Sections 31-36
- Detailed rules for enforcement
- Specific provisions for different scenarios

**Condition:**
- Governed by general contract principles
- Sections 31-36 may apply if condition is contingent on external event
- Interpretation depends on parties' intention

#### Examples Illustrating Differences

**Example 1:**

**Contingent Contract:**
"I will sell you my house for ₹1 crore if I get transferred to Mumbai within 6 months."
- Transfer is external event (depends on employer)
- Collateral to sale
- Contract exists, performance contingent

**Condition Precedent:**
"I will sell you my house for ₹1 crore if you arrange finance within 1 month."
- Finance arrangement is buyer's action
- No sale contract until buyer arranges finance
- Condition precedent to contract formation

**Example 2:**

**Contingent Contract:**
Insurance company agrees: "We will pay ₹50 lakhs if your factory burns within 5 years."
- Fire is external contingent event
- Payment contingent on fire occurring
- Contract exists from beginning

**Condition:**
Employment contract: "You will receive ₹10 lakhs bonus if company profits exceed ₹100 crores this year."
- Profit level is condition for bonus
- Employment contract exists regardless
- Bonus payment conditional

**Example 3:**

**Contingent Contract:**
"A promises to pay B ₹10 lakhs if B's ship arrives from London."
- Ship's arrival is external contingent event
- Payment contingent on arrival
- A's promise exists now

**Condition Concurrent:**
Sale of goods: "Seller will deliver goods and buyer will pay cash simultaneously."
- Conditions concurrent (mutual and simultaneous)
- Both conditions part of main contract
- Not contingent on external event

### 8. Remedies

**Contingent Contract:**
- If event happens: Contract enforceable
- If event becomes impossible: Contract void
- No question of breach before event occurs or becomes impossible

**Condition:**
- **Condition Precedent:** If not fulfilled, contract doesn't arise; no breach
- **Condition Subsequent:** If occurs, contract terminates
- May be breach if party prevents condition from being fulfilled

#### Comparison Table: Contingent Contract vs. Condition

| **Aspect** | **Contingent Contract** | **Condition** |
|------------|-------------------------|---------------|
| **Nature** | Entire contract depends on event | Term affecting contract |
| **Event** | External and collateral | May be party's action |
| **Formation** | Contract exists from beginning | May affect formation |
| **Control** | Generally beyond parties' control | May be in party's control |
| **Provisions** | Sections 31-36 | General principles |
| **Effect** | Determines if/when performance due | Determines obligations |
| **Example** | Pay if ship arrives | Buy if you repair car first |

#### Case Laws on Distinction

**1. Pramatha Nath v. Pradyamna Kumar (1925) - Privy Council**
Facts: Sale of property contingent on court approval. Plaintiff prevented approval through his conduct.
Held: Distinguished between external contingency and condition within party's control. Party cannot benefit from preventing condition.

**2. Taylor v. Caldwell (1863)**
Facts: Contract to let music hall. Hall destroyed by fire before performance.
Held: Contract discharged. Fire was external contingency. Contract impliedly contingent on hall's existence.

#### Practical Implications

**For Contingent Contracts:**
1. Useful for risk management
2. Insurance, guarantees, indemnity
3. Protected by law
4. Clear provisions for enforcement

**For Conditions:**
5. Structure contractual obligations
6. Control timing of performance
7. Allow flexibility in contracts
8. Protect parties' interests

**For Avoiding Wagers:**
1. Ensure genuine business interest
2. Have insurable interest (for insurance)
3. Intention to perform (for speculative contracts)
4. Purpose beyond winning stake

#### Conclusion
Contingent contracts, wagering agreements, and contracts with conditions represent three distinct legal concepts, each with different implications for contract formation and enforceability. Contingent contracts are valid agreements where performance depends on uncertain external events collateral to the contract, serving legitimate business purposes such as insurance and risk management. In contrast, wagering agreements are void as they involve pure speculation without genuine interest in the subject matter, serving only to facilitate gambling. The key distinction lies in whether parties have a legitimate interest beyond the stake and whether the arrangement serves a productive purpose. Contracts with conditions, while similar to contingent contracts, differ in that conditions may be within parties' control and may affect the very formation of the contract rather than merely the timing of performance. Understanding these distinctions is essential for drafting enforceable agreements, particularly in insurance, guarantee, conditional sales, and speculative business transactions. The law protects contingent contracts while prohibiting wagers, recognizing that while uncertainty is inherent in commerce, gambling and speculation without genuine interest undermine economic stability and social welfare.
