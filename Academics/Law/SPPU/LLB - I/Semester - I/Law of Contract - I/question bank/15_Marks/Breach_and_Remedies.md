# BREACH OF CONTRACT AND REMEDIES – 15 MARKS QUESTIONS

## Question 1: State the remedies available to the aggrieved person in case of breach of contract. Explain with relevant provisions and case laws.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Introduction

Breach of contract occurs when a party to the contract fails to perform his obligations under the contract or performs them defectively. The aggrieved party (the innocent party) is entitled to certain remedies under the law. The Indian Contract Act, 1872, along with the Specific Relief Act, 1963, provides comprehensive remedies to protect the interests of the injured party.

#### Types of Breach

**1. Actual Breach:**
- Breach occurring on due date of performance
- Party fails to perform when performance becomes due

**2. Anticipatory Breach:**
- Breach before performance is due
- Party expresses intention not to perform before due date
- Or makes performance impossible by his own act

#### Remedies for Breach of Contract

### 1. Rescission of Contract (Section 65, 75)

**Meaning:**
When one party breaches contract, other party can rescind (cancel) the contract and refuse to perform his part.

**Legal Basis:** Section 65 and 75 of Indian Contract Act

**Consequences:**
- Contract becomes voidable at option of injured party
- Injured party freed from all obligations
- Entitled to compensation for any loss suffered

**Example:**
A agrees to supply goods to B on 15th January. On 10th January, A refuses to supply. B can rescind contract and refuse to pay price.

**Case Law: Karsandas v. Sheth Narottamdas (1910)**
When one party commits breach, other party can treat contract as rescinded.

### 2. Suit for Damages (Sections 73-75)

**Meaning:**
Monetary compensation for loss suffered due to breach.

**Types of Damages:**

**(a) Ordinary/General Damages (Section 73)**

Compensation for loss or damage naturally arising from breach in ordinary course of things.

**Section 73:** "When a contract has been broken, the party who suffers by such breach is entitled to receive, from the party who has broken the contract, compensation for any loss or damage caused to him thereby, which naturally arose in the usual course of things from such breach, or which the parties knew, when they made the contract, to be likely to result from the breach of it."

**Measure:** Loss must be:
- Natural consequence of breach, OR
- In contemplation of parties at time of contract

**Case Law: Hadley v. Baxendale (1854) - English**
**Facts:** Mill shaft broken. Sent to manufacturer for repair. Delayed in transit. Mill remained closed longer, causing loss of profits.
**Held:** Damages for loss of profits not recoverable. Carrier didn't know shaft was only one and delay would stop mill. Not in reasonable contemplation.

**Principle:** Only losses reasonably foreseeable at time of contract are recoverable.

**(b) Special Damages (Section 73)**

Damages for losses arising due to special circumstances which parties knew at time of contract.

**Example:** A contracts to deliver goods to B, knowing B has to re-sell to C. If A breaches, B can claim loss of profit from re-sale (special damages).

**(c) Vindictive/Punitive/Exemplary Damages**

Not generally awarded in contract breach cases in India (unlike tort). Only compensation for actual loss.

**Exception:** Breach of promise to marry - court may award some amount for injured feelings.

**Case Law: Bhim Singh v. Smt. Ramlibai (1980)**
Exemplary damages not awarded for mere breach of contract in India.

**(d) Nominal Damages**

Small sum awarded when breach proved but no substantial loss suffered.

**Example:** Seller fails to deliver goods worth ₹1,000. Buyer gets goods from elsewhere at same price. Buyer entitled to nominal damages (say ₹100) for breach, though no actual loss.

**(e) Damages for Deterioration Caused by Delay (Section 73)**

When breach is delay in performance, damages for loss due to delay.

**(f) Penalty vs. Liquidated Damages (Section 74)**

**Section 74:** "When a contract has been broken, if a sum is named in the contract as the amount to be paid in case of such breach, or if the contract contains any other stipulation by way of penalty, the party complaining of the breach is entitled, whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused thereby, to receive from the party who has broken the contract reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so named or, as the case may be, the penalty stipulated for."

**Penalty:** Amount fixed to frighten party into performance. Not genuine pre-estimate of loss.

**Liquidated Damages:** Genuine pre-estimate of probable loss.

**In India:** No distinction. Court awards reasonable compensation not exceeding stipulated amount.

**Case Law: Maula Bux v. Union of India (1970) - Supreme Court**
Section 74 makes no distinction between penalty and liquidated damages. Court can award reasonable compensation up to stipulated amount.

### 3. Suit for Specific Performance (Specific Relief Act, 1963)

**Meaning:**
Court directs the defaulting party to perform the contract as agreed.

**Legal Basis:** Sections 10-20 of Specific Relief Act, 1963

**When Available:**
- Damages inadequate remedy
- Particularly for contracts involving immovable property or unique goods

**Section 10 - When Specific Performance Granted:**

Specific performance may be granted when:
1. Monetary compensation inadequate
2. Contract relates to immovable property
3. Subject matter is unique (rare paintings, antiques)

**When NOT Granted (Section 14):**

1. Damages adequate remedy
2. Contract involves personal services
3. Contract requires continuous supervision
4. Contract is divisible and part already performed
5. Performance involves hardship

**Example:**
A agrees to sell specific plot of land to B. A later refuses. B can sue for specific performance compelling A to transfer land (because land is unique).

**Case Law: Nirmala Anand v. Advent Corporation (2002)**
Specific performance is discretionary remedy. Granted when justice, equity, and good conscience demand.

### 4. Suit for Injunction (Specific Relief Act, 1963)

**Meaning:**
Court order restraining party from doing something contrary to contract.

**Types:**

**(a) Temporary/Interim Injunction:**
Granted during pendency of suit to maintain status quo.

**(b) Perpetual/Permanent Injunction:**
Granted at end of trial as final relief.

**When Granted:**
- To prevent breach of negative covenant
- To restrain party from violating terms

**Section 38 of Specific Relief Act:**
Perpetual injunction granted to prevent breach of obligation where damages inadequate.

**Example:**
A agrees not to open competing business within 5 km after selling goodwill to B. A opens competing shop. B can get injunction restraining A.

**Case Law: Niranjan Shankar v. Century Spinning (1967)**
Court may grant injunction to enforce negative covenant if reasonable and valid.

**Limitation:**
Courts don't grant injunction to indirectly enforce personal service contracts.

**Case Law: Lumley v. Wagner (1852)**
Opera singer contracted to sing at plaintiff's theater and not at any other. She breached. Court granted injunction restraining her from singing elsewhere (negative covenant), but didn't compel her to sing at plaintiff's theater (positive covenant).

### 5. Suit for Quantum Meruit

**Meaning:**
"As much as earned" - claim for reasonable remuneration for work done.

**When Available:**
1. Contract becomes void after partial performance
2. One party abandons/repudiates contract
3. Work done under void agreement
4. Divisible contract partly performed

**Case Law: Planché v. Colburn (1831)**
Author contracted to write book. Publisher abandoned project after author completed substantial work. Author entitled to quantum meruit for work done.

**Case Law: Sumpter v. Hedges (1898)**
Builder abandoned construction halfway. Not entitled to quantum meruit as he was in default. But entitled to value of materials left behind and used by owner.

**Section 65 - Application:**
When agreement discovered void or becomes void, person receiving advantage must restore it or compensate.

### 6. Suit for Restitution

**Meaning:**
Restoration of benefits received under contract before breach.

**Legal Basis:** Sections 64-65 of Indian Contract Act

**When Applicable:**
When party rescinds contract, must restore benefits received.

**Example:**
A sells goods to B. B pays advance. A fails to deliver. B can rescind and claim refund of advance.

#### Principles Governing Damages

**1. Remoteness of Damages:**

Only proximate consequences recoverable, not remote.

**Rule in Hadley v. Baxendale:**
Damages must either:
- Arise naturally from breach in ordinary course, OR
- Be reasonably in contemplation of both parties at time of contract

**2. Mitigation of Loss (Section 73, proviso):**

**Section 73 proviso:** "...but such compensation is not to be given for any remote and indirect loss or damage sustained by reason of the breach. Explanation: In estimating the loss or damage arising from a breach of contract, the means which existed of remedying the inconvenience caused by the non-performance of the contract must be taken into account."

**Duty to Mitigate:**
Injured party must take reasonable steps to minimize loss. Cannot claim avoidable losses.

**Example:**
A contracts to supply goods. A breaches. B must buy goods from market at reasonable price, not wait indefinitely allowing loss to increase.

**Case Law: British Westinghouse v. Underground Railways (1912)**
Injured party must take reasonable steps to mitigate loss. Cannot recover for losses that could have been avoided.

**3. Certainty of Damages:**

Damages must be proved with reasonable certainty. Cannot be speculative.

**4. Causation:**

Breach must be proximate cause of loss. Loss must flow directly from breach.

#### Comparison of Remedies

| **Remedy** | **Nature** | **When Available** | **Effect** |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Rescission** | Cancellation | Substantial breach | Contract terminated |
| **Damages** | Monetary | All breaches | Compensation |
| **Specific Performance** | Compulsory performance | Unique subject matter | Performance enforced |
| **Injunction** | Restraining order | Negative covenant breach | Prevents violation |
| **Quantum Meruit** | Reasonable payment | Work done, contract void/repudiated | Payment for work |

#### Bars to Relief

**1. Delay/Laches:**
Unreasonable delay in claiming relief may bar remedy.

**2. Acquiescence:**
If party accepts breach without protest, may lose right to remedy.

**3. Waiver:**
Party may waive right to claim remedy.

**4. Time Bar (Limitation):**
Must file suit within limitation period.

#### Conclusion

The law provides comprehensive remedies to protect parties from breach of contract. The choice of remedy depends on nature of breach, subject matter of contract, and loss suffered. While damages are common remedy providing monetary compensation, specific performance and injunction ensure actual performance where damages are inadequate. The principles of remoteness, mitigation, and certainty govern award of damages, ensuring fairness. Quantum meruit provides relief for partial performance, and rescission allows termination when breach is substantial. Understanding these remedies is crucial for protecting contractual rights and ensuring justice to the aggrieved party. The remedies aim not to punish the breaching party but to place the injured party in position he would have been if contract had been performed, thereby upholding sanctity of contracts in commercial and personal transactions.
