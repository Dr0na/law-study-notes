# CONSIDERATION – 15 MARKS QUESTIONS

## Question 1: Define consideration and explain its essential elements under the Indian Contract Act, 1872. "An agreement without consideration is void." Discuss the exceptions to this rule.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Introduction
Consideration is one of the essential elements for the validity of a contract. It is the price paid by one party for the promise of the other. The Indian Contract Act, 1872 requires consideration for a valid contract, subject to certain exceptions. The maxim "Ex nudo pacto non oritur actio" (no action arises from a naked contract) embodies this principle.

#### Definition of Consideration

**Section 2(d) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 defines consideration as:**
"When, at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains from doing, or promises to do or to abstain from doing, something, such act or abstinence or promise is called a consideration for the promise."

**Simple Definition:**
Consideration is something of value given by one party in exchange for the promise or performance of another party.

**Popular Definitions:**
1. **Sir Frederick Pollock:** "An act or forbearance of one party, or the promise thereof, is the price for which the promise of the other is bought."
2. **Lush J:** "A valuable consideration in the sense of law may consist either in some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other."

#### Essential Elements of Consideration

**1. Consideration Must Move at the Desire of the Promisor**

The act or forbearance must be done at the desire or request of the promisor, not voluntarily or at the instance of a third party.

**Case Law: Durga Prasad v. Baldeo (1880)**
Facts: D constructed shops on land belonging to B at the desire of Collector. B promised to pay commission. B later refused.
Held: No consideration as construction was not done at B's desire but at Collector's request. Promise not enforceable.

**Case Law: Kedar Nath v. Gorie Mohamed (1886)**
Facts: K built shops on his own land at the request of G to increase land value. G promised commission on sales.
Held: Valid consideration as work was done at G's desire. Promise enforceable.

**2. Consideration May Move from the Promisee or Any Other Person**

Unlike English law (which requires consideration to move from promisee), Indian law allows consideration to move from any person.

**Section 2(d) specifically states:** "the promisee or any other person"

**Case Law: Chinnaya v. Ramayya (1882) - Leading Case**
Facts: An old lady (A) gifted her property to her daughter (B) who promised to pay annuity to A's sister (C). B failed to pay C. C sued.
Held: C can sue even though she was not a party to the contract. Consideration (property) moved from A, but C can enforce as she is beneficiary.

This case establishes the doctrine of **"Consideration from a third party is valid in India."**

**3. Consideration May Be Past, Present, or Future**

**a) Past Consideration:**
Something already done before the promise is made.

**Illustration:**
A renders services to B. Later, B promises to pay ₹10,000 for those services. B's promise is enforceable in India (but not in England).

**b) Present Consideration (Executed Consideration):**
Consideration given simultaneously with the promise.

**Illustration:**
A pays ₹500 and B hands over a book. This is present consideration.

**c) Future Consideration (Executory Consideration):**
Consideration to be given in future.

**Illustration:**
A promises to deliver goods next month and B promises to pay on delivery. Both are future considerations.

**4. Consideration Must Be Real and Not Illusory**

Consideration must have some value in the eyes of law, but need not be adequate.

**Case Law: Thomas v. Thomas (1842)**
Facts: A house let for £1 per year, actual rent being much higher.
Held: £1 is sufficient consideration, though not adequate.

**5. Consideration Must Be Legal**

It must not be illegal, immoral, or opposed to public policy.

**Illustration:**
A promises to pay B ₹1 lakh if B commits a theft. This consideration is illegal and void.

**6. Consideration Need Not Be Adequate**

Courts do not assess the adequacy of consideration. Parties are free to fix their own price.

**Section 25 implies this principle.**

**Case Law: Haigh v. Brooks**
Facts: D guaranteed payment of bill. Consideration was surrender of bill which was useless.
Held: Even though bill was worthless, it was sufficient consideration.

#### Agreement Without Consideration Is Void - Section 25

**General Rule:**
Section 25 of the Indian Contract Act states: "An agreement made without consideration is void, unless it falls under one of the exceptions."

**Rationale:**
1. Ensures seriousness of intent
2. Prevents hasty promises
3. Provides evidence of contract
4. Ensures reciprocity

#### Exceptions to "No Consideration, No Contract" Rule - Section 25

**Exception 1: Natural Love and Affection [Section 25(1)]**

**Conditions:**
1. Agreement must be in writing

4. Must be made on account of natural love and affection

**Case Law: Rajlukhy Dabee v. Bhootnath Mookerjee (1900)**
Facts: Husband promised to pay wife maintenance in writing due to domestic disputes.

**Conditions:**
1. Services must have been rendered voluntarily
2. Must be for the promisor
3. Promisor must promise to compensate
4. Services must not have been rendered at promisor's desire (else it would be valid consideration)

**Case Law: Sindha Shri Ganpatsinghji v. Abraham (1895)**
Facts: S advanced money to save A's property from sale. Later A promised to repay.
Held: Promise enforceable as compensation for past voluntary service.

**Illustration:**
A finds B's wallet and returns it. B promises to pay ₹1,000 as reward. This is enforceable even though service was rendered before promise.

**Exception 3: Promise to Pay Time-Barred Debt [Section 25(3)]**

**Conditions:**
1. Debt must be time-barred (beyond limitation period)
2. Promise to pay must be in writing
3. Must be signed by debtor or his authorized agent
4. Promise may be to pay whole or part of debt

**Rationale:**
Revives a debt that has become unenforceable due to lapse of time.

**Case Law: Lalmohun Das v. Narayan Das**
Facts: Debtor promised in writing to pay time-barred debt by installments.
Held: Promise enforceable. Writing is sufficient even without registration.

**Illustration:**
A borrowed ₹50,000 from B in 2010. Limitation expired in 2013. In 2020, A writes and signs: "I promise to pay the ₹50,000 to B." This is enforceable.

#### Other Exceptions Under Indian Contract Act

#### Inadequacy of Consideration

**General Principle:**

- Undue influence
- Coercion
- Misrepresentation

**Case Law: Chappell & Co. Ltd. v. Nestle Co. Ltd. (1960)**
Facts: Chocolate wrappers plus money as consideration for records.
Held: Wrappers were part of consideration even though of little value.

#### Consideration vs. Motive

**Consideration:**
- Essential element of contract
- Must have value in eyes of law
- Creates legal obligation
- Example: A sells car to B for ₹5 lakhs (₹5 lakhs is consideration)

**Motive:**
- Reason behind making contract
- Not legally significant
- Does not create obligation
- Example: A sells car to pay off debt (paying debt is motive)

**Case Law: Thomas v. Thomas**
Widow allowed to live in house for £1 per year in accordance with deceased husband's wishes.
Consideration: £1 per year
Motive: Fulfilling husband's wishes

#### Forbearance as Consideration

Forbearance (refraining from doing something one has a right to do) is valid consideration.

**Types:**
1. **Forbearance to sue:** Agreeing not to file a lawsuit
2. **Forbearance of existing right:** Not exercising a legal right

**Case Law: Mohori Bibee v. Dharmodas Ghose (1903)**
Facts: Money lender abstained from suing minor debtor.
Held: Forbearance to sue can be valid consideration if there is valid claim.

#### Past Consideration

**Indian Law:** Past consideration is valid (Section 2(d) uses past tense "has done")

**English Law:** Past consideration is generally not valid unless:
1. Act done at promisor's request
2. Parties understood payment would be made
3. Payment would have been enforceable if promised beforehand

**Indian Advantage:**
Indian law is more liberal. Past consideration is valid even without these conditions.

#### Comparison: Indian vs. English Law

| **Aspect** | **Indian Law** | **English Law** |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Stranger to Consideration** | Can sue | Cannot sue |
| **Past Consideration** | Valid | Generally invalid |
| **Time-barred Debt** | Written promise sufficient | New consideration needed |
| **Natural Love** | Exception to consideration | No such exception |

#### Conclusion
Consideration is the cornerstone of a valid contract, representing the quid pro quo essential for legal enforceability. While the general rule mandates that an agreement without consideration is void, the Indian Contract Act recognizes several well-defined exceptions based on moral obligations, past services, and written promises. The requirement of consideration ensures that contracts reflect genuine bargains rather than mere gratuitous promises. Indian law's liberal approach, particularly in allowing consideration to move from third parties and recognizing past consideration, makes it more flexible than English law. However, the exceptions are narrowly construed to prevent abuse while accommodating genuine moral and family obligations. Understanding the doctrine of consideration and its exceptions is essential for determining the enforceability of agreements and protecting the interests of contracting parties.

## Question 2: "Consideration need not be adequate but must be sufficient." Explain this statement with the help of case laws. Also distinguish between past, present, and future consideration.

### MODEL ANSWER:

#### Introduction
The concept of consideration is fundamental to contract law, and understanding its nature is crucial for determining the validity of agreements. One of the most important principles is that consideration need not be adequate but must be sufficient. This principle reflects the law's respect for freedom of contract while ensuring that promises have some legal value.

#### Consideration Need Not Be Adequate

**Meaning:**
Adequacy of consideration refers to the equality or comparative value between what is given and what is received. The law does not concern itself with whether the parties have made a good or bad bargain.

**Legal Principle:**
Courts do not act as guardians of adults who are competent to contract. Parties are free to determine their own consideration, however disproportionate it may be to the value received.

**Rationale:**
1. **Freedom of Contract:** Parties have liberty to fix their own terms
2. **Subjective Value:** Value varies from person to person
3. **Judicial Non-Interference:** Courts should not interfere in commercial decisions
4. **Certainty:** Difficult to objectively assess "adequate" value

#### Consideration Must Be Sufficient

**Meaning:**
Sufficiency of consideration means that consideration must be real, have some value in the eyes of law, and not be illusory or meaningless.

**Requirements for Sufficient Consideration:**
1. Must be something of value in the eyes of law
2. Must be real and not illusory
3. Must be lawful
4. Must be something the promisor desires
5. Need not be equal in value to promise

#### Important Case Laws

**1. Thomas v. Thomas (1842)**
Facts: A husband expressed wish that his wife should have use of house after his death for £1 per annum, though actual rental value was much more. After his death, executors agreed to let widow occupy house for £1 per year. Later they tried to evict her claiming inadequate consideration.
Held: £1 per year was sufficient consideration even though grossly inadequate. Courts don't assess adequacy. Contract was valid.

**2. Chappell & Co. Ltd. v. Nestle Co. Ltd. (1960)**
Facts: Nestle sold records for money plus three chocolate wrappers. Wrappers were thrown away. Question arose whether wrappers were part of consideration.
Held: Chocolate wrappers, though of minimal value, formed part of consideration. Court cannot assess adequacy of consideration.

**3. Haigh v. Brooks (1839)**
Facts: A gave up a document (guarantee) as consideration, which turned out to be legally unenforceable and practically worthless.
Held: Even though document was worthless, giving it up was sufficient consideration as it had some value in eyes of parties at the time.

**4. De La Bere v. Pearson Ltd. (1908)**
Facts: Newspaper gave financial advice which turned out to be bad. Subscriber claimed breach.
Held: Purchase of newspaper for small price was sufficient consideration for advice, even though price was primarily for the paper, not advice.

**5. Mohori Bibee v. Dharmodas Ghose (1903) - Indian Case**
Facts: Money lent to minor. Lender forbore to sue for some time.
Held: Forbearance to sue can be good consideration if there is valid claim. However, contract with minor was void.

**6. Durga Prasad v. Baldeo (1880) - Indian Case**
Facts: D spent money constructing shops at Collector's request (not B's). B promised commission.
Held: Not sufficient consideration as work was not done at B's desire. Consideration must move at desire of promisor.

#### When Consideration Is Insufficient

Even though adequacy is not required, consideration may be insufficient in following cases:

**1. Illusory Consideration**
Promise that leaves promisor free to perform or not.
Example: "I will pay if I feel like it" - Not binding consideration

**2. Existing Legal Duty**
Performance of existing legal duty is not sufficient consideration.
Example: Police officer promising to catch thief for reward - Not valid consideration

**3. Impossible Acts**
Promise to do something impossible is not consideration.
Example: Promise to touch the sun - Not valid consideration

**4. Illegal Consideration**
Consideration involving illegal acts is not sufficient.
Example: Promise to pay for committing crime - Not valid consideration

**5. Vague Consideration**
Consideration that is too vague or uncertain.
Example: Promise to pay "reasonable amount" without criteria - May be insufficient

#### Exceptions to Adequacy Rule

While courts don't assess adequacy, gross inadequacy may be evidence of:

**1. Fraud**
Example: Selling property worth ₹1 crore for ₹1 lakh through fraudulent misrepresentation

**2. Undue Influence**
Example: Elderly person selling property to caretaker for nominal price

**3. Coercion**
Example: Forcing someone to sell property for inadequate price under threat

**4. Misrepresentation**
Example: Selling damaged goods as new for full price

**5. Unconscionable Bargains**
Example: Taking advantage of poor/illiterate person

#### Past, Present, and Future Consideration

#### A. Past Consideration

**Definition:**
Consideration that has been given before the promise is made. It is something already done or suffered before the contract is made.

**Indian Law Position:**
Section 2(d) recognizes past consideration as valid. The section uses words "has done or abstained from doing" indicating past tense.

**English Law Position:**
Generally, past consideration is not valid in England except when:
1. Act was done at promisor's request
2. Parties understood payment would be made
3. Payment would have been legally enforceable if promised in advance

**Examples of Past Consideration:**

**Example 1:**
A saves B's property from fire. Later B promises to pay ₹50,000 as reward.
In India: Valid and enforceable (past consideration is valid)
In England: Not enforceable (unless exceptions apply)

**Example 2:**
A finds B's lost dog and returns it. B promises to pay ₹5,000 as reward.
In India: Enforceable as past consideration is valid

**Case Law: Sindha Shri Ganpatsinghji v. Abraham (1895)**
Facts: S helped A save his property from auction sale by advancing money. Later A promised to repay S.
Held: Valid contract. Promise to compensate for past voluntary service is enforceable under Section 25(2).

**Case Law: Lampleigh v. Braithwait (1615) - English Case**
Facts: B requested L to obtain pardon for him. L did so. Later B promised to pay £100.
Held: Valid consideration. When act is done at promisor's request with understanding of payment, subsequent promise is enforceable.

#### B. Present Consideration (Executed Consideration)

**Definition:**
Consideration that is given simultaneously with the promise. Promise and consideration happen at the same time.

**Characteristics:**
1. Immediate exchange
2. Contemporaneous performance
3. No credit or future obligation
4. Complete at time of promise

**Examples:**

**Example 1: Cash Sale**
A pays ₹1,000 and B hands over book immediately.
- A's consideration: Payment of money (present)
- B's consideration: Delivery of book (present)

**Example 2: Restaurant**
Customer pays bill and immediately gets food.
Both consideration and promise are present/executed.

**Example 3: Reward**
A announces reward for finding lost item. B finds and returns it, receiving reward immediately.
B's consideration: Finding item (present)
A's consideration: Payment (present)

**Case Law: Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. (1893)**
Facts: Company promised £100 to anyone who used smoke ball as directed and still got flu.
Mrs. Carlill used it and got flu. She claimed reward.
Held: She accepted offer by performing conditions. Her act of using product was present consideration for company's promise.

#### C. Future Consideration (Executory Consideration)

**Definition:**
Consideration consisting of a promise to be performed in the future. Both parties make promises to perform in future.

**Characteristics:**
1. Most common type in commercial contracts
2. Creates executory contracts
3. Both parties have future obligations
4. Credit transactions

**Examples:**

**Example 1: Sale Agreement**
A promises to deliver goods next month. B promises to pay on delivery.
- A's consideration: Future promise to deliver
- B's consideration: Future promise to pay
- Both considerations are future/executory

**Example 2: Employment Contract**
Employer promises to pay salary. Employee promises to work.
Both obligations are future (executory consideration).

**Example 3: Construction Contract**
Builder promises to construct house in 6 months. Owner promises to pay on completion.
Both considerations are executory.

**Example 4: Order for Goods**
Buyer orders goods for delivery next month and promises to pay on receipt.
Both promises relate to future performance.

**Case Law: Great Northern Railway v. Witham (1873)**
Facts: W offered to supply railway company with items as required for one year. Railway accepted and placed orders.
Held: Each order was acceptance creating separate contract with future consideration (supply in future for payment in future).

#### Comparison Table

| **Aspect** | **Past** | **Present** | **Future** |
|------------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Timing** | Before promise | With promise | After promise |
| **Examples** | Past services rewarded | Cash sales | Credit transactions |
| **Indian Law** | Valid | Valid | Valid |
| **English Law** | Generally invalid | Valid | Valid |
| **Common in** | Gratitude cases | Retail transactions | Commercial contracts |
| **Risk** | Low (already done) | None | Highest |

#### Practical Applications

**In Contract Drafting:**
1. Clearly specify type of consideration
2. For past consideration, document in India but avoid in international contracts
3. For future consideration, specify timelines and conditions
4. For present consideration, document simultaneous exchange

**In Dispute Resolution:**
1. Identify type of consideration involved
2. Check if consideration is sufficient (not adequate)
3. Verify consideration moved at promisor's desire
4. Confirm consideration is legal and possible

#### Conclusion
The principle that consideration need not be adequate but must be sufficient reflects the law's balance between contractual freedom and legal enforceability. Courts respect parties' freedom to make their own bargains, however unequal, while ensuring that promises are supported by something of legal value. The adequacy doctrine prevents judicial interference in commercial judgments, while the sufficiency requirement ensures that only genuine bargains are enforceable. The distinction between past, present, and future consideration is particularly significant in Indian law, which takes a more liberal approach by recognizing past consideration as valid. Understanding these principles is essential for drafting enforceable contracts and avoiding disputes over the validity of consideration in various commercial and personal transactions.
