**1. Contract Becomes Void**

When contract discovered to be void after partial performance, party who performed can claim quantum meruit.

**Section 65:**
"When an agreement is discovered to be void, or when a contract becomes void, any person who has received any advantage under such agreement or contract is bound to restore it, or to make compensation for it to the person from whom he received it."

- Contract is divisible (severable)
- Party not in default

#### Quantum Meruit vs. Damages

| **Quantum Meruit** | **Damages** |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Claim for work done | Claim for loss suffered |
| Restitutionary remedy | Compensatory remedy |
| Based on value of work | Based on breach of contract |
| Quasi-contractual | Contractual |
| Reasonable remuneration | Loss actually suffered |

#### Practical Examples

**Example 1: Contract Repudiated**
A hires B to construct house. B completes foundation. A abandons project. B can claim quantum meruit for foundation work.

**Example 2: Void Contract**
A contracts with minor M to paint M's house (void contract). A paints house. A can claim reasonable payment under quantum meruit from M's estate.

**Example 3: Partial Acceptance**
A orders 100 chairs from B. B delivers 60 chairs. A accepts them but refuses to pay saying contract was for 100. A must pay proportionate amount for 60 chairs.

**Example 4: Work Under Mistake**
A paints B's house thinking it's his own (by mistake). B watches and benefits. B must pay quantum meruit.

#### Conclusion
Quasi contracts represent the law's commitment to fairness and prevention of unjust enrichment. While not arising from agreement between parties, they create obligations similar to contracts based on principles of equity and natural justice. The five categories under Sections 68-72 cover situations where one party benefits at another's expense without a contract - from necessaries supplied to incapable persons, to payments made by interested persons, non-gratuitous acts, found goods, and money paid by mistake or coercion. The doctrine of quantum meruit complements these provisions by ensuring that persons who render services or perform work are compensated reasonably even when no enforceable contract exists. These principles prevent the moral wrong of allowing someone to retain an advantage obtained at another's cost without justification. Understanding quasi contracts is essential for recognizing that legal obligations can arise from equity and fairness, not merely from express agreements, ensuring that the law promotes justice in commercial and personal dealings.
