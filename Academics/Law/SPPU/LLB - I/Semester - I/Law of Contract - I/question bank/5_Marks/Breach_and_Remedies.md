## Q10: Explain the case of Allcard v. Skinner.

**Allcard v. Skinner (1887) - English Court of Appeal**

**Subject:** Undue Influence and Delay

**Facts:**
- Miss Allcard joined religious order "Sisters of the Poor"
- Took vows of poverty, chastity, obedience
- Over years, gave property (£7,000) to Mother Superior (Miss Skinner)
- Gifts made under spiritual guidance
- No independent legal advice taken
- After many years, left the order
- Sought to recover property

**Issue:**
1. Was there undue influence?
2. Could she recover gifts?

**Held:**

**1. Undue Influence Established:**
- Gifts made under undue influence
- Spiritual authority of Mother Superior over plaintiff
- Relationship of dominance existed
- No independent legal advice
- Not result of free judgment

**2. Recovery Barred by Delay:**
However, could NOT recover because:
- Unreasonable delay (laches) in claiming
- Remained in order many years after gaining knowledge
- Delay = acquiescence/affirmation
- Too late to seek rescission

**Principles:**

**1. Undue Influence in Religious Relationships:**
Spiritual authority can dominate will of follower. Presumption of undue influence when gifts made.

**2. Independent Advice Necessary:**
Person making substantial gift to religious leader should have independent legal advice.

**3. Delay Bars Relief:**
Even if undue influence proved, unreasonable delay bars rescission.

**Maxim:** "Equity aids the vigilant, not those who slumber on their rights."

**4. Passive Undue Influence:**
Not active coercion, but domination from relationship itself.

**Relevance in India:**

**Section 16(2)(a):**
Person in position of authority deemed to dominate will.

**Similar Indian Cases:**
**Raghunath Prasad v. Sarju Prasad (1924):**
Guru-disciple relationship. Presumption of undue influence.

**Application:**
- Religious/spiritual donations
- Guru-disciple transfers
- Any fiduciary relationship with dominance

**Key Takeaway:**
While law protects against undue influence, remedy must be sought promptly. Delay bars relief even if undue influence proved.
