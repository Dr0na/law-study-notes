## Q2: Explain the three exceptions to "Agreement without consideration is void" under Section 25.

**General Rule:** Agreement without consideration is void (Section 25).

**Three Exceptions:**

**1. Natural Love and Affection (Section 25(1)):**
- Must be in writing and registered
- Between parties in near relation
- Made on account of natural love and affection

**Case Law:** Rajlukhy Dabee v. Bhootnath - Promise during quarrels not enforceable.

**2. Compensation for Past Voluntary Services (Section 25(2)):**
- Services rendered voluntarily
- For the promisor
- Promisor promises to compensate

**Case Law:** Sindha Shri Ganpatsinghji v. Abraham - Promise to repay for past help enforceable.

**3. Promise to Pay Time-Barred Debt (Section 25(3)):**
- Debt barred by limitation
- Promise in writing
- Signed by debtor

**Example:** Debt of ₹50,000 barred by limitation. Debtor writes: "I promise to pay." Enforceable.

## Q3: "Consideration need not be adequate but must be sufficient." Explain.

**Adequacy vs. Sufficiency:**
- **Adequate:** Equal in value
- **Sufficient:** Having some value in law

**Principle:**
Courts don't assess whether parties made good bargain (adequacy), but ensure consideration has legal value (sufficiency).

**Case Law: Thomas v. Thomas (1842)**
£1 per year rent for house worth much more - sufficient though inadequate.

**Case Law: Chappell & Co. v. Nestle (1960)**
Chocolate wrappers plus money - wrappers part of consideration despite negligible value.

**Insufficient Consideration:**
- Illusory promises
- Performing existing legal duty
- Impossible acts
- Illegal acts

**When Inadequacy Matters:**
May evidence fraud, undue influence, or coercion - not about adequacy itself.

## Q4: Explain "Consideration may move from the promisee or any other person" with case law.

**Section 2(d):** Explicitly states "the promisee or any other person."

**Meaning:**
In Indian law, consideration need not move from promisee. Can move from third party.

**Landmark Case: Chinnaya v. Ramayya (1882)**
**Facts:**
- Old lady (A) gifted property to daughter (B)
- B promised to pay annuity to A's sister (C)
- B failed to pay
- C sued

**Held:** C can sue even though she gave no consideration. Consideration moved from A. C is beneficiary.

**Comparison:**
- **English Law:** Consideration must move from promisee. Stranger to consideration cannot sue.
- **Indian Law:** More liberal. Stranger to consideration can sue if beneficiary.

**Example:**
Father transfers property to son. Son promises to maintain father's brother. Uncle can sue son.

## Q5: Distinguish between past, present, and future consideration.

**1. Past Consideration:**
- Already done before promise made
- Valid in India (Section 2(d) uses "has done")
- Generally invalid in England

**Example:** A saves B's property. Later B promises to pay ₹10,000. Valid in India.

**2. Present Consideration (Executed):**
- Given simultaneously with promise
- Contemporaneous exchange
- Valid everywhere

**Example:** A pays ₹1,000, B gives book immediately. Both present consideration.

**3. Future Consideration (Executory):**
- Promise to be performed in future
- Most common in commercial contracts
- Valid everywhere

**Example:** A promises to deliver goods next month. B promises to pay on delivery. Both future.

**Case Law: Durga Prasad v. Baldeo (1880)**
Work not done at promisor's desire - no consideration.

## Q6: What is forbearance as consideration?

**Forbearance:**
Refraining from doing something one has legal right to do.

**Valid Consideration:**
Promise not to exercise legal right is valuable consideration.

**Types:**
1. **Forbearance to sue:** Agreeing not to file lawsuit
2. **Forbearance of right:** Not exercising legal right

**Case Law: Mohori Bibee v. Dharmodas Ghose (1903)**
Money lender abstained from suing minor. Forbearance to sue can be valid consideration if there's valid claim.

**Example:**
- A has claim against B. B promises to pay ₹5 lakhs if A doesn't sue. A's forbearance is valid consideration.

**Requirements:**
1. Must forbear actual legal right
2. Right must be honestly claimed
3. Reasonable belief in right's existence

## Q7: Explain the doctrine "No consideration, no contract" with exceptions.

**Maxim:** "Ex nudo pacto non oritur actio" - No action arises from naked contract.

**General Rule (Section 25):**

**Rationale:**
1. Shows seriousness of intent
2. Prevents hasty promises
3. Provides evidence of contract
4. Ensures reciprocity

**Exceptions:**
1. Natural love and affection (written, registered, near relation)
2. Past voluntary services compensation
3. Time-barred debt (written promise)

5. Agency (Section 185)
6. Remission/extension (Section 63)

## Q8: Explain consideration vs. motive.

**Consideration:**
- Essential element of contract
- Must have value in law
- Creates legal obligation
- Something of value exchanged
- Legal concept

**Motive:**
- Reason for making contract
- Not legally significant
- Does not create obligation
- Inducement behind contract
- Psychological concept

**Case Law: Thomas v. Thomas (1842)**
- Widow allowed to live in house for £1/year in accordance with deceased husband's wishes
- **Consideration:** £1 per year (legally relevant)
- **Motive:** Fulfilling husband's wishes (not legally relevant)

**Example:**
A sells car to B for ₹5 lakhs to pay off loan.
- **Consideration:** ₹5 lakhs (creates obligation)
- **Motive:** Paying loan (personal reason, no legal effect)

**Key Difference:**
Consideration is what makes promise enforceable. Motive is why promise made.
