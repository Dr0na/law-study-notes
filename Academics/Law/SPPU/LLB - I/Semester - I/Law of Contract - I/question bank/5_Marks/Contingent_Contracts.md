**Section 33 - Contingent on Non-happening of Event:**

## Q3: Explain contingent contracts on conduct of person (Section 34).

**Section 34:**
"If the future event on which a contract is contingent is the way in which a person will act at an unspecified time, the event shall be considered to become impossible when such person does anything which renders it impossible that he should so act within any definite time, or otherwise than under further contingencies."

**Meaning:** If contract depends on how person will act, becomes void when person does something making specified action impossible.

**Illustration:** A promises to pay B if B marries C. C marries D. Marriage of B to C now impossible. Contract void.

**Case Law: Frost v. Knight (1872)**
Man promised to marry woman after father's death. Married another woman during father's lifetime. Woman could sue immediately (contingency impossible).

**Example:** Company offers job if candidate obtains degree. Candidate takes permanent job elsewhere. Obtaining degree now unlikely. Contract may become void.

- Time expires without event, OR
- Event becomes impossible before time

**Example:** Pay if ship returns within one year.
- Enforceable if returns within year
- Void if: (a) year passes without return, OR (b) ship burns

**Part 2: Event doesn't happen within time**
Contract enforceable if:
- Time expires without event, OR

## Q5: Explain Section 36 - Contingent on impossible events.

**Section 36:**
"Contingent agreements to do or not to do anything if an impossible event happens are void, whether the impossibility of the event is known to the parties or not."

**Principle:** Agreement contingent on impossible event is void from beginning.

**Types of Impossibility:**
1. **Physical impossibility:** Inherently impossible
2. **Legal impossibility:** Impossible due to law

**Illustration:** A agrees to pay B if B marries A's daughter C. C was dead at time of agreement. Void - marriage impossible.

**Examples:**
- Promise to pay if person brings back someone who died years ago - void
- Promise to pay if person touches sun - void (physically impossible)
- Promise to pay if person obtains license for prohibited business - void (legally impossible)

**Knowledge Irrelevant:** Doesn't matter if parties knew of impossibility.

- Governed by Sections 31-36

**Contract with Condition:**

- Condition may be party's action
- May affect formation or continuance
- General contract principles

**Types of Conditions:**
1. **Condition Precedent:** Must be fulfilled before contract/obligation arises
2. **Condition Subsequent:** Terminates existing obligation
3. **Condition Concurrent:** Mutual simultaneous performance

**Example:**

- Contract exists, performance contingent

**Condition Precedent:** "I'll sell house if you arrange finance."
- Finance arrangement is buyer's action
- No contract until finance arranged

**Key Difference:**
- Contingent: External event, collateral
- Condition: May be internal, part of contractual relationship
