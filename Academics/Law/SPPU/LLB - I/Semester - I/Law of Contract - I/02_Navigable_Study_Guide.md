# Part 1: Foundations

## 1.1 Overview of Contract Law

### What is a Contract?

A **contract** is a legally binding agreement between two or more parties that creates mutual obligations enforceable by law.

**Key Principle:** 
> "All contracts are agreements, but all agreements are not contracts."

### The Contract Formation Process

```
Agreement → Contract (if legally enforceable) → Valid Contract
```

**Key Distinction:**
- **Agreement** = Promise + Consideration
- **Contract** = Agreement + Legal Enforceability

## 6.4 Exam Strategy

### Question Types & How to Answer

#### 1. "Is this a valid contract?"

**Approach:**
1. Check all 7 essential elements systematically
2. Use the checklist:
   - ✅ Offer & Acceptance?
   - ✅ Consideration?
   - ✅ Competent parties?
   - ✅ Free consent?
   - ✅ Lawful object?
   - ✅ Not expressly void?
   - ✅ Certainty?
3. State which elements are present/absent
4. Conclude: Valid or Invalid (and why)

**Example Structure:**
```
For a contract to be valid under Section 10, it must satisfy:
1. Offer & Acceptance: [Analyze]
2. Consideration: [Analyze]
3. Competent Parties: [Analyze]
4. Free Consent: [Analyze]
5. Lawful Object: [Analyze]
6. Not Expressly Void: [Analyze]
7. Certainty: [Analyze]

Conclusion: [Valid/Invalid because...]
```

#### 2. "Distinguish between X and Y"

**Approach:**
1. Define both concepts
2. List key differences (use table if helpful)
3. Give examples
4. Reference relevant sections

**Example:**
```
VOID vs VOIDABLE

Definition:
- Void (2g): Agreement not enforceable
- Voidable (2i): Contract valid until avoided

Key Differences:
1. Effect: Void = No effect; Voidable = Valid until avoided
2. Enforceability: Void = Cannot enforce; Voidable = Can enforce
3. Examples: Void = Bilateral mistake; Voidable = Fraud

Sections: 2(g) and 2(i)
```

#### 3. "Explain with examples"

**Approach:**
1. Define the concept
2. Explain the rule/law
3. Give relevant example
4. Reference section number

#### 4. "What are the remedies?"

**Approach:**
1. Identify the breach
2. List available remedies (Section 73-75)
3. Explain each remedy
4. Apply to facts
5. Reference case law if relevant

### Time Management

- **Short Questions (5 marks)**: 5-7 minutes
- **Medium Questions (10 marks)**: 12-15 minutes
- **Long Questions (15-20 marks)**: 20-25 minutes

### Answer Writing Tips

1. **Start with definition** (if applicable)
2. **Reference section numbers** (shows knowledge)
3. **Use examples** (demonstrates understanding)
4. **Apply to facts** (shows application)
5. **Conclude clearly** (summarize answer)
