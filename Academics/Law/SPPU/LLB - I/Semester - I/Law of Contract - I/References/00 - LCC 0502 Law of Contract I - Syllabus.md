Individuals, organisations, institutions, governments make countless contracts for effecting their transactions. They enjoy considerable freedom in devising the terms of their transactions, which they will decide through negotiations.

Contract remedies are also provided in the **Specific Relief Act, 1963 (SRA)**. These two laws form the main course for this subject.
