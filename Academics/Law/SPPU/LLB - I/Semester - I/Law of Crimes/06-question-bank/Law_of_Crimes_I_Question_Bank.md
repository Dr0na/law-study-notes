# SECTION A: 15-MARK QUESTIONS

## ✅ QUESTION 1: Distinguish between Culpable Homicide and Murder

### MODEL ANSWER

**INTRODUCTION**

Culpable Homicide is defined under Section 299 IPC (Section 100 BNS 2023) and Murder is defined under Section 300 IPC (Section 101 BNS 2023). The relationship between these two offenses is that all murders are culpable homicide, but all culpable homicides are not murder. Murder is an aggravated form of culpable homicide. The difference lies only in the degree of intention and knowledge.

**CULPABLE HOMICIDE (SECTION 299 IPC / 100 BNS)**

According to Section 299, a person is said to commit culpable homicide if the act by which death is caused is done:
1. With the intention of causing death, OR
2. With the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, OR
3. With the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death

**MURDER (SECTION 300 IPC / 101 BNS)**

Culpable homicide is murder if:
1. The act is done with the intention of causing death, OR
2. With the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows is likely to cause death, OR
3. With the intention of causing bodily injury which is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, OR
4. The person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death

**DISTINCTION BETWEEN CULPABLE HOMICIDE AND MURDER**

| **Aspect**                | **Culpable Homicide**                   | **Murder**                              |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Intention**             | Intention to cause injury LIKELY to cause death | Intention to cause injury SUFFICIENT in ordinary course to cause death |
| **Knowledge**             | Knowledge act LIKELY to cause death    | Knowledge act in ALL PROBABILITY will cause death |
| **Degree**                | PROBABILITY                            | CERTAINTY                              |
| **Example**               | A strikes B once on head with stick → B dies | A stabs B repeatedly in chest with knife → B dies |
| **Punishment (IPC)**      | Section 304: Life imprisonment or 10 years | Section 302: Death or life imprisonment |
| **BNS Sections**          | Sections 100-105                       | Section 101                            |

**KEY PRINCIPLE:**

The distinction is primarily one of **DEGREE** rather than kind. The difference lies in:
- The degree of intention required
- The degree of knowledge required
- The probability of death occurring

**EXCEPTIONS TO MURDER (SECTION 300 IPC)**

Even when an act falls under Section 300, it may be reduced to culpable homicide under five exceptions:

1. **Exception 1:** Grave and sudden provocation
2. **Exception 2:** Exceeding right of private defense in good faith
3. **Exception 3:** Public servant exceeding powers in good faith
4. **Exception 4:** Sudden fight without premeditation
5. **Exception 5:** Consent of person killed (if 18+ years)

**JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION**

**Virsa Singh v. State of Punjab (AIR 1958 SC 465):**
The Supreme Court laid down a four-step test:
1. Was there intention to cause bodily injury?
2. What was the bodily injury intended?
3. Was it sufficient in ordinary course to cause death?
4. Was it the intended injury of the kind mentioned in Section 300, Clause 3?

**Kesar Singh v. State of Haryana (2010):**
The Court held that the distinction between knowledge and intention is a difference of degrees. Knowledge denotes conscious awareness while intention connotes a conscious state directing activity toward a specific end.

**Rampal Singh v. State of U.P. (2005):**
The Court observed that culpable homicide is the genus and murder is the species. The mental element differentiates the two - culpable homicide involves lower degree of mens rea compared to murder.

**CONCLUSION**

The distinction between culpable homicide and murder is subtle but significant. While both involve causing death, murder requires a higher degree of intention or knowledge. The test is not whether death was probable (culpable homicide) but whether it was certain or highly probable (murder). The exceptions to murder bring certain cases back into the ambit of culpable homicide, recognizing that circumstances may reduce culpability even when the act would ordinarily amount to murder.

## ✅ QUESTION 2: Explain Right of Private Defense with its Limitations

### MODEL ANSWER

**INTRODUCTION**

The right of private defense is a fundamental right based on the instinct of self-preservation. Section 96 IPC (Section 34 BNS 2023) provides that nothing is an offense which is done in exercise of the right of private defense. This right is preventive in nature, not punitive. It exists because the State cannot provide immediate protection in every situation where a person or property is in danger.

**NATURE AND SCOPE OF RIGHT**

The right of private defense is recognized in all civilized societies subject to reasonable limitations. It is based on two principles:
1. Every member of society has this natural right
2. The State takes responsibility for law and order but cannot be everywhere

**TYPES OF PRIVATE DEFENSE**

1. **Private Defense of Body** (Sections 100-101, 97-99 IPC)
   - Against assault, wrongful restraint, rape, kidnapping, etc.

2. **Private Defense of Property** (Sections 102-105, 97-99 IPC)
   - Against theft, robbery, mischief, trespass, etc.

**WHEN DOES THE RIGHT ARISE?**

**Commencement:**
- When reasonable apprehension of danger arises
- Need not wait for actual assault
- Right is anticipatory in nature

**Continuation:**
- So long as the danger continues
- Cannot be exercised before danger arises or after it ceases

**Termination:**
- When danger ceases to exist
- When attacker escapes or is disarmed
- When public authorities arrive

**EXTENT: WHEN CAN DEATH BE CAUSED?**

**A. In Defense of Body (Section 100 IPC):**

Death can be caused in private defense of body against:
1. Assault causing reasonable apprehension of **death**
2. Assault causing reasonable apprehension of **grievous hurt**
3. Assault with intent to commit **rape**
4. Assault with intent to gratify **unnatural lust**
5. Assault with intent to **kidnap or abduct**
6. Assault with intent to **wrongfully confine** (when unable to seek help from public authority)
7. Act of throwing or administering **acid** or corrosive substance

**B. In Defense of Property (Section 103 IPC):**

Death can be caused in private defense of property against:
1. **Robbery**
2. **House-breaking by night**
3. **Mischief by fire** to dwelling house or building used for custody of property
4. **Theft, mischief, or house-trespass** under circumstances causing reasonable apprehension of death or grievous hurt

**RESTRICTIONS ON RIGHT (SECTION 99 IPC)**

**1. No Right if Time to Seek Public Authority:**
- If there is time to seek protection of public authorities
- Exception: In sudden emergency when no time available

**2. No Right Against Public Servant Acting in Good Faith:**
- No right against public servant acting under duty in good faith
- Exception: If it causes reasonable apprehension of death or grievous hurt

**3. No Right Against Innocent Person:**
- Cannot cause harm to innocent third party
- Right exists only against actual aggressor

**4. Must Not Inflict More Harm than Necessary:**
- Principle of proportionality
- Force must be commensurate with danger apprehended
- Cannot be excessive

**5. Must Not Be Vindictive:**
- Right is preventive, not retributive
- Cannot pursue fleeing attacker
- Ends when danger ends

**LEADING CASES**

**Vidhya Singh v. State of M.P. (AIR 1971 SC):**
The Supreme Court held that the right of private defense is available only so long as the necessity for it exists. It is a defensive right and not a retributive or punitive right. It cannot be claimed when the necessity of defense has passed.

**Darshan Singh v. State of Punjab (2010 SC):**
There is no right of private defense against public servants acting in discharge of duty in good faith, even if their act is not strictly justifiable by law, unless it causes reasonable apprehension of death or grievous hurt.

**Munshi Ram v. Delhi Administration (1968 SC):**
The right of private defense extends to voluntary causing of death if the offense is one of those enumerated in Section 100. However, the force used must not be disproportionate to the injury apprehended.

**ILLUSTRATIONS**

**Example 1:**
A attempts to horsewhip Z. Z draws pistol and shoots A dead. This may be excessive as horsewhipping doesn't cause apprehension of death or grievous hurt. Z may be guilty of culpable homicide.

**Example 2:**
A attempts to rape Z at night. Z shoots and kills A. Z is protected under Section 100 as assault with intent to rape justifies causing death.

**Example 3:**
A throws stone at Z's house causing damage. Z shoots A dead. This is excessive. Right of private defense of property doesn't extend to causing death for mere mischief without circumstances causing apprehension of death or grievous hurt.

**PRIVATE DEFENSE vs. OTHER DEFENSES**

**Private Defense vs. Necessity (Section 81):**
- Private defense: Against wrongdoer
- Necessity: May be against innocent person
- Private defense: Specific enumerated circumstances
- Necessity: General principle of choosing lesser evil

**Private Defense vs. Duress:**
- Private defense: Active resistance
- Duress: Compulsion to commit offense

**BURDEN OF PROOF**

The burden to establish circumstances for private defense initially lies on the accused. However, once some evidence is produced, the burden shifts to prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that:
- Circumstances for private defense didn't exist, OR
- Force used was excessive

**CONCLUSION**

The right of private defense is an important safeguard against unlawful aggression when immediate state protection is unavailable. However, it is subject to strict limitations to prevent abuse. The key principles are:
- Must be proportionate
- Must be necessary
- Must end when danger ends
- Cannot be vindictive
- Subject to restrictions in Section 99

The law recognizes that self-preservation is a natural instinct but balances it with the need to prevent excessive violence and maintain rule of law.

## ✅ QUESTION 3: Discuss M'Naghten Rule as applicable to Indian Law

### MODEL ANSWER

**INTRODUCTION**

Section 84 of the Indian Penal Code (BNS Section TBD) provides defense of unsoundness of mind, commonly known as the defense of insanity. This section is based on the famous M'Naghten Rule established in 1843 in England. The underlying principle is "actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea" - an act does not make a person guilty unless the mind is also guilty. If the mind is incapable of understanding due to insanity, there can be no mens rea and hence no criminal liability.

**SECTION 84 IPC**

"Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law."

**ORIGIN: M'NAGHTEN'S CASE (1843)**

Daniel M'Naghten suffered from paranoid delusions believing that Prime Minister Robert Peel was persecuting him. He shot at Peel but killed his secretary Edward Drummond by mistake. He was tried for murder but acquitted on ground of insanity. This led to public controversy and House of Lords formulated rules for insanity defense.

**M'NAGHTEN RULES:**

"To establish a defense on ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of committing the act, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong."

**ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS OF SECTION 84**

**1. Person of Unsound Mind:**
- Not defined in IPC
- Courts have interpreted as equivalent to insanity
- Covers various mental disorders
- Must be at time of commission of act

**2. By Reason of Unsoundness:**
- Causal connection required
- Unsoundness must cause the incapacity
- Not every mental illness qualifies

**3. Incapable of Knowing:**
Either of two:
- **a) Nature of the act** (First limb)
  - Complete insanity
  - Person doesn't understand what he's doing
  - Rare cases
  
- **b) That act is wrong or contrary to law** (Second limb)
  - Partial insanity also covered
  - Person understands act but not wrongfulness
  - More common situations

**LEGAL INSANITY vs. MEDICAL INSANITY**

| **Legal Insanity**               | **Medical Insanity**              |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Narrow concept                   | Wide concept                      |
| Defined by Section 84            | All mental disorders              |
| Cannot know nature/wrongfulness  | Any mental illness                |
| Legal test                       | Medical diagnosis                 |
| Not all medical insanity is legal insanity |                     |

**CRUCIAL TIME: AT TIME OF ACT**

Section 84 explicitly states "at the time of doing it." The unsoundness of mind must exist at the time of commission of the offense.

**Evidence to Determine:**
- Conduct **before** the act
- Conduct **during** the act (most important)
- Conduct **after** the act

**NOT Relevant:**
- Insanity before act (unless continuing)
- Insanity after act (unless proves state during act)

**BURDEN OF PROOF**

**Section 105, Evidence Act:**
- Burden lies on accused
- Standard: Preponderance of probabilities (not beyond reasonable doubt)
- Accused must produce some evidence
- Then prosecution must prove sanity beyond reasonable doubt

**LEADING CASES**

**Hari Singh Gond v. State of M.P. (AIR 2008 SC):**
The Supreme Court observed that Section 84 sets out the legal test of responsibility in cases of alleged unsoundness of mind. There is no definition of 'unsoundness of mind' in IPC. The Courts have mainly treated this expression as equivalent to insanity. A distinction must be made between legal insanity and medical insanity. A Court is concerned with legal insanity, not medical insanity.

**Rattan Lal v. State of M.P. (AIR 1971 SC):**
The crucial point of time at which unsoundness of mind should be established is the time when the crime is actually committed. Whether the accused was in such a state of mind as to be entitled to the benefit of Section 84 can only be determined from the circumstances which preceded, attended, and followed the crime.

**Kamala Bhuniya v. West Bengal State (1973):**
The accused killed her husband with an axe. There was no motive. The investigating officer noted her mental unsoundness. The Court held that the prosecution failed to discharge its burden of proving the presence of mens rea at the time of commission. The accused was entitled to benefit of Section 84.

**Surendra Mishra v. State of Jharkhand (2011 SC):**
Every person suffering from mental illness is not ipso facto exempt from criminal liability. The burden lies on the accused to prove the conditions of Section 84 are satisfied.

**WHAT IS NOT COVERED**

**1. Irresistible Impulse:**
- Sudden uncontrollable urge
- Person knows act is wrong but cannot control
- Not covered under Section 84
- Covered in some foreign jurisdictions

**2. Partial Delusion:**
- Person has delusion about one fact
- Otherwise sane
- Apply test: Would act be justified if facts were as believed?

**3. Diminished Responsibility:**
- Mental condition doesn't amount to insanity
- May reduce culpability but not exempt
- No separate provision in IPC

**4. Psychopathic Personality:**
- Antisocial personality disorder
- Lack of empathy
- Not covered unless affects understanding of right/wrong

**INSANITY vs. INTOXICATION**

Section 84 (Insanity) applies even if insanity is caused by long-term alcohol or drug use, if it results in permanent disease of mind.

**EFFECT OF SUCCESSFUL PLEA**

If insanity is proved:
- Complete acquittal
- Not guilty
- But may be detained in mental asylum for treatment
- Under various state mental health laws

**PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES**

**1. Proof Issues:**
- Difficult to prove state of mind at past time
- Requires expert testimony
- Conflict between medical and legal tests

**2. Malingering:**
- Accused may fake insanity
- Courts scrutinize carefully
- Expert examination required

**3. Temporary vs. Permanent:**
- Temporary insanity difficult to prove
- Must exist at exact time of act

**COMPARISON WITH OTHER COUNTRIES**

**England:** M'Naghten Rules still apply with some modifications

**USA:** Various tests used:
- M'Naghten test
- Irresistible impulse test
- Durham rule
- Model Penal Code test

**RECENT TRENDS**

Courts have become stricter in applying Section 84:
- Not every mental abnormality qualifies
- Burden strictly on accused
- Medical evidence must show legal insanity, not just medical diagnosis
- Conduct before, during, after act carefully scrutinized

**CONCLUSION**

Section 84 embodies the M'Naghten Rule and provides an important safeguard ensuring that persons who lack mens rea due to genuine mental incapacity are not punished. However, the test is strict and narrow. Legal insanity is different from medical insanity. Not every mentally ill person can claim this defense. The burden lies on the accused to prove on preponderance of probabilities that at the time of the act, he was incapable of knowing either the nature of his act or that it was wrong. The defense of insanity recognizes that criminal law is based on moral culpability and a person who cannot understand his actions or their wrongfulness should not be held criminally responsible.

# SECTION B: 10-MARK QUESTIONS

## ✅ QUESTION 1: Explain Abetment under IPC

### MODEL ANSWER

**INTRODUCTION**

Abetment is defined under Section 107 IPC (Section 45 BNS 2023). It makes a person liable for an offense even if he doesn't actually commit it but helps in its commission. The law recognizes that a person who instigates, conspires, or aids in commission of an offense is equally culpable.

**DEFINITION (SECTION 107 IPC)**

A person abets an offense when he:
1. Instigates any person to do that thing; OR
2. Engages in conspiracy for the doing of that thing; OR
3. Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing

**THREE WAYS OF ABETMENT**

**1. ABETMENT BY INSTIGATION:**
- Active suggestion, incitement, encouragement
- Goading, urging person to commit offense
- Creating atmosphere of encouragement
- Not mere advice or casual remark

**2. ABETMENT BY CONSPIRACY:**
- Agreement between two or more persons
- To do illegal act or legal act by illegal means
- Overt act not necessary for abetment liability

**3. ABETMENT BY INTENTIONAL AID:**
- Help by act or illegal omission
- Must be intentional
- Knowledge that act being aided is offense
- Examples: Keeping watch, providing weapons, driving getaway vehicle

**IMPORTANT SECTIONS**

**Section 109:** Abettor present when offense committed - Same punishment as principal

**Section 113:** Abettor absent when offense committed - Same punishment as principal

**Section 111:** If abetment results in different offense than intended - Abettor liable for that offense if consequence of abetment

**Section 115:** Abetment of offense punishable with death/life - If offense not committed - Up to 7 years + fine

**PRINCIPLES**

1. **Abettor may be punished though principal not identified/not punished**
2. **Impossibility no defense** - A abets B to kill C; C already dead - A still liable
3. **Abetment of abetment possible** - A abets B to abet C (Section 111)

**CASES**

*State of Maharashtra v. Sushilbai* (2010): Abetment requires positive act and mere silence doesn't amount to abetment.

**CONCLUSION**

Abetment provisions ensure that masterminds and helpers are equally liable with actual perpetrators, making criminal liability comprehensive.
