 Section 361 Kidnapping from Lawful Guardianship  
As per Section 361 Kidnapping from Lawful Guardianship means, “Whoever takes or entices 
any minor under (sixteen) years of age if a male, or under -(eighteen) years of age of a female, or 
any person of unsound mind, out of the keepi ng of the lawful guardian of such minor or person 
of unsound mind, without the consent of such guardian, is said to kidnap such minor or person 
from lawful guardianship.”  
Explanation:  
“Lawful Guardian” includes any person who is lawfully entrusted with car e and custody of such 
minor or other person.  
Exception  
This section does not extend to the act of any person who in good faith believes himself to be the 
father of an illegitimate child or who in good faith believes himself to be entitled to lawful 
custody  of such child, unless such act is committed for an immoral or unlawful purpose.  
Object of the Section  
The purpose of this section is to protect minors and persons of unsound mind from being 
exploited and protect the rights of guardians who have the lawful  charge or custody of their 
wards. Thus, absence of consent of the parent or guardian is the main ingredient of this section.  
Ingredients  
The following are the ingredients of Section 361:  
 Taking away or enticing of a minor or a person of unsound mind  
Enticing is inducing hope or desire in the mind of a person to make him do things which he 
wouldn’t do otherwise. Persuasion by the accused person which creates willingness on the part 
 of the minor to be taken out of the keeping of lawful guardian would be  sufficient to attract the 
section.  
The expression used in  Section  361, I.P.C. is “whoever takes or entices any minor”. The word 
“takes” does not necessarily connote taking by force and it is not confined only to use of force, 
actual or constructive. This word merely means, “to cause to go,” “to escort” or “to get into 
possession”.  
 Such minor must be under 16 years of age if a male and under 18 years of age if a 
female  
 The taking or enticing must be out of the keeping of the lawful guardian of such minor 
or person of unsound mind . 
The act of taking is not a continuous act and as such when once the boy or girl has been actually 
taken out of the keeping, the act is complete.  
The Court in  Vardargan V. State of Madras 1965 AIR 942, 1965 SCR (1) 243 highlighted t he 
dichotomy between ‘taking’ and ‘allowing a minor to accompany a person’. Stating that the two 
are not synonymous held that where the minor having capacity to understand the consequences 
of her actions voluntarily joins the accused on her free will, the accused cannot be held liable for 
taking her away from the keeping of lawful guardian.  
The taking or enticing must also be without the consent of the guardian.  
The consent of the minor is immaterial for this section and its only the consent of the guardian  
that will take the case out of the purview of this section.  
The Supreme Court in  Pradeep Kumar v. State of Bihar and Anr  AIR 2007 SC 3059  held that the 
consent obtained by lying to the father of the girl regarding the purpose of taking his minor 
daughter away cannot be termed as consent under the purview of this section and such taking 
away would amount to kidnapping.  
 
 Section 363 Punishment for Kidnapping  
As per Section 363, “Whoever kidnaps any person from India or from lawful guardianship, shall 
be puni shed with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, 
and shall also be liable to fine.”  
The punishment for the offence of kidnapping provides for both fine and imprisonment. 
Abduction means forcibly taking away of a pers on and moving him or her from one place to 
another against their will. Use of force is a necessary ingredient of abduction. Abduction is the 
criminal act of taking by force or strong persuasion of a wife, husband, child or other person.[1]  It 
has also bee n defined as the illegal act of taking away a person by persuasion, fraud or by open 
force or violence. The offence of Abduction is mentioned under Section 362 of the Indian Penal 
Code.  
Section 362 of IPC  
Abduction  
“Whoever by force compels or by deceitful means induces, any person to go from any place, is 
said to abduct that person.”  
The Section only gives a definition to the offence of Abduction which is not punishable per se. It 
is only punishable if it is accompanied with a criminal intent whic h is included in the subsequent 
sections of the Penal Code.  
Ingredients of Abduction  
Forcefully Compelling or inducement of a person by deceitful means  
The provision makes it amply clear that taking away of a person should be accompanied by 
either forceful  compelling or by deceitful means, merely threatening to use force would not 
result in abduction of a person. The element of compelling by force of inducement by fraudulent 
or deceitful means is a necessary ingredient to amount the taking of person to abdu ction.   Force 
 has been defined under Section 349 of the Indian Penal Code and has the same meaning under 
this section. Inducement means “0to lead into” something and thus deceitful inducement would 
be misleading a person to do something which he or she wou ldn’t ordinarily do.  
To go from any place/ Going of a person from any place  
To constitute abduction, the person so abducted, must have gone from one place to another by 
compulsion of force or by inducement by deceitful means.  
Role of Consent  
Consent of the  person who is moved or taken away is of vital importance in abduction. Unlike 
kidnapping where consent of the person who is taken away is immaterial, in abduction consent 
given by the person moved will not amount to an act of abduction.   
Illustrations  
1. A is a minor daughter of B. A voluntarily goes away with C and indulges in sexual relations 
with him. C cannot be held liable for abduction because A wilfully consented to go with him, 
there was no use of force or inducement.  
2. Y is a minor daughter of R.  X forcibly takes away Y without the knowledge of R. Y runs away 
with Z while she is custody of R who is X’s relative. In this case, X is liable for abduction, 
however Z will be liable if he had some criminal intent to take away Y.  
Abduction is not a subst antive offence. It is however an auxiliary act or a subsidiary act which is 
only punishable when coupled with a criminal intent. Abduction is not a crystallised offence but 
a continuing one. It does not confine to the first time a person is taken away or m oved from one 
place. It extends to every other person who is involved in the moving of the person by use of 
force or deceitful means.  
 
 Case Laws  
Bhanukan’s Case  
Chief Justice Wanchoo  observed that there was no abduction because he was satisfied that the 
girl was not compelled by force or induced by any deceitful means to go with the accused. The 
girl being a minor had gone out with the accused to have sexual intercourse, the court hel d that 
she wasn’t abducted as no undue influence or force was used upon her.  
Vinod Chaturvedi v. State of Madhya Pradesh  
In the present case, the appellant was alleged to have abducted the deceased Brindaban. The 
process of investigation pointed out that Brindaban on being persuaded by the accused persons 
and Vinod in particular went inside his house, came out properly dressed to accompany the 
group to village Ramapura. Such conduct made it clear that Brindaban was not abducted the 
accused persons.  
State o f Assam vs. Goljer Ali and Nine Ors.  
Abduction, as defined under Section 362 IPC contemplates both user of force or inducement by 
deceitful means. The deceased in the present case was offered a puff of Bidi and was therefore 
induced to go to the house of t he accused where he has beaten to death.  
 
 
 
 
 
 Difference between Kidnapping and Abduction  
Basis  Kidnapping  Abduction  
Provision  Kidnapping is classified in Section 359 
into two categories and is defined in 
Section 360 and 361 which relates to 
Kidnapping from India and Kidnapping 
from Lawful Guardianship . Definition to the offence of Abduction 
is given under Section 362 of the Indian 
Penal Code.  
Age The offence of kidnapping relates to taking 
away of minors and people of unsound 
mind . The offence of Abduction is in respect 
of all persons.  
Means Employed  Kidnapping is an offence which involves 
taking away or enticing of a person.  Abduction involves taking away of a 
person by fraud or by force.  
Intention  Intention of the person is of no 
significance. Once it is established that that 
taking away either outside India or outside 
the lawful guardianship is present, it 
amounts to kidnapping.  Intention plays a major role in the 
offence of abduction. A person is 
punishable only if abduction is done 
with an il l intent or criminal intent.  
Nature of 
Offence  Kidnapping is a substantial offence and is 
punishable under Section 363 of the Indian 
Penal Code.  Abduction is merely an auxiliary act 
and is not punishable unless it is done 
with a criminal intent.  
Consent  Consent of the person who is taken outside 
the custody of lawful guardian is 
immaterial.  Consent given by the person who is 
taken, takes the act out of the purview 
of abduction.  
 Completion of 
the Offence  Once a person is taken out of the country 
or outsid e the custody of lawful guardian, 
the offence of kidnapping is complete.  The offence of abduction involves 
forcibly or fraudulently taking of a 
person from one place to another, hence 
it is a continuing offence.

Meaning  
The word rape is derived from the Latin term  rapio,  which mean ‘to seize’. Thus, rape literally 
means a forcible seizure. It signifies in common terminology, “as the ravishment of a woman 
without her consent, by force, fear, or fraud” or “the carnal knowledge of a woman by force 
against her will.” In other words, rape is violation with violence of the private person of a 
woman.  
In the Indian Penal Code,  Section 375  defines rape.

history of Indian Judiciary case  laws. By this amendment act, our legislators introduced some 
new sections and make some amendments in Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code, 
Indian Evidence Act and Protection of children from sexual offences act.  
 Some of the important changes brough t about by the Act 43 of 1983 and Act 13 of the 2013 and

Definition of rape (After amendment of Sec 375)  
A man is said to commit “rape” if he – 
1. penetrates his penis, to any extent, into the vagina, mouth, urethra or  anus of a woman or 
makes her to do so with him or any other person; or  
2. inserts, to any extent, any object or a part of the body, not being the penis, into the vagina, the 
urethra or anus of a woman or makes her to do so with him or any other person; or  
3. manipulates any part of the body of a woman so as to cause penetration into the vagina, 
urethra, anus or any part of body of such woman or makes her to do so with him or any other 
person; or  
4. applies his mouth to the vagina, anus, urethra of a woman or makes her to do so with him or 
any other person, under the circumstances falling under the seven descriptions.[3] 
Analysis of the definition  
The 2013 Act expands the definition of rape to include oral sex as well as the insertion of an 
object or any oth er body part into a woman’s vagina, urethra or anus.  
A man is guilty of rape if he commits sexual intercourse with a woman either against her will or 
without her consent as enumerated under clauses firstly to seventhly under section 375.  
Essential Ingredie nts of Rape  
The crux of the offence of rape under section 375, IPC is sexual intercourse by a man with a 
woman against her will and without her consent under any one of the seven circumstances 
mentioned below.  
  Against her will.  
 Without her consent.  
 With consent obtained by putting her or any other person in whom she is interested in 
fear of death or of hurt,  
 With consent but given under the misconception of fact that the man was her husband,  
 Consent given by reason of unsoundness of mind, or under influen ce of intoxication 
or any stupefying or unwholesome substance,  
 Women under eighteen with or without consent.  
 When women is unable to communicate consent.  
In order to bring home the charge of rape against a man, it is necessary to establish that the 
‘sexual  intercourse’ complained of was either against the will or without her consent. Where the 
consent is obtained under the circumstances enumerated under clauses firstly to seventhly, the 
same would also amount to rape.  
Rape or Consensual Sex  
Intercourse unde r promise to marry constitutes rape only from initial stage accused had no 
intention to keep the promise. An accused can be convicted for rape only if the court reaches the 
conclusion that the intention of the accused was malafide, and that he had clandest ine 
motives.  Deepak Gulati vs State of Haryana AIR 2013 SC 2071.  
Exception to Section 375  
‘Exception 2 - Sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being 
under sixteen years of age, is not sexual assault.’  
Since child marriag e in India is not yet void and is only voidable, such a check was necessary to 
restrain men from taking advantage of their marital rights prematurely. No man can be guilty of 
rape on his own wife when she is over 15 years of age on account of the matrimoni al consent 
that she has given.  
 In Bishnudayal vs. State of Bihar 2003 Cri LJ 1539 SC , where the prosecutrix, a girl of 13 or 14, 
who was sent by her father to accompany the relatives of his elder daughter’s husband to look 
after her elder sister for some time, was forcibly ‘married’ to the appellant and had sexual 
intercourse with her, the accused was held liable for rape under section 376.  
However, under section 376 B, IPC sexual intercourse with one’s own wife without her consent 
under a decree of judici al separation is punishable by 2 to 7 years imprisonment.  
Punishment of rape   
It states that if the rape is committed by persons listed below, they shall be punished with 
rigorous punishment of not less than 10 years, but can extend to imprisonment for life, which 
shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of that person’s natural life, and shall also be liable 
to fine.  
 Police officer within the limits of the police station.  
 A police officer in the premises of any station house.  
 A police officer on a woma n in the police officer’s custody.

may extend to imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine.  
Section 376 -A of the IPC – Punishment for causing death or resulting in persistent vegetative 
state of victim  
It says if a p erson commits an offence which is punishable under section 376 which causes the

the remainder of that person’s natural life, or with death.’   
Case Laws  
The Nirbhaya Case (2012)  
This case hardly requires any facts to be stated as it is still fresh in the consciousness of the 
nation. A paramedical student was tortured by six men to such an extent that an iron rod was 
shoved into her vagina and her i ntestines, abdomen, and genitals were damaged severely. They 
threw her out of the bus in the wintery night. One of the accused was juvenile and was sent to a 
 reform facility for three years. One of the accused committed suicide in the jail and rest were 
given the death penalty.  
The court observed that “Question of awarding sentence is a matter of discretion and has to be 
exercised on consideration of circumstances aggravating or mitigating in the individual cases… 
protection of society and deterring the cri minal is the avowed object of law…while determining 
sentence in heinous crimes, Judges ought to weigh its impact on the society and impose adequate 
sentence considering the collective conscience or society’s cry for justice. While considering the 
impositio n of appropriate punishment, courts should not only keep in view the rights of the 
criminal but also the rights of the victim and the society at large.”  
Rameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod vs State Of Gujarat  
In the instant case, the victim who had not seen even  ten summers in her life is the victim of 
sexual assault and animal lust of the accused appellant. She was not only raped but was 
murdered by the accused appellant.  
Imposition of the sentence without considering its effect on the social order in many cases  may 
be in reality a futile exercise. As dealing with sentencing, courts have thus applied the “Crime 
Test”, “Criminal Test” and the “Rarest of the Rare Test”, the tests examine whether the society 
abhors such crimes and whether such crimes shock the consc ience of the society and attract 
intense and extreme indignation of the community. Courts have further held that where the 
victims are helpless women, children or old persons and the accused displayed depraved 
mentality, committing crime in a diabolic mann er, the accused should be shown no remorse and 
death penalty should be awarded.  
State vs Deepak Dogra  
The boy established the sexual relations with the victim on the false pretext that he will marry 
her later. He performed an invalid marriage when the girl complained of him to the police when 
he refused to marry her and she was pregnant with his child. Kee ping in view the ghastly and 
inhuman act of the convict, a substantive and stern sentence is required to be imposed upon the 
convict so that it is not only in commensuration with the gravity of the crime but also serves as 
 an example for the others who mig ht also venture on the same forbidden path..  The convict does 
not deserve any leniency.  
State of Maharashtra vs Chandraprakash Kewal Chand Jain  
A girl who was newly married was raped by one policeman twice while his husband was kept 
separate from her. He not only raped her but also threatened her that if she opens her mouth, then 
he will burn her and her husband alive. Trial court -sentenced the respondent to suffer rigorous 
imprisonment for 5 years and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000 in default to suffer rigorou s imprisonment 
for 6 months.  
The court held that when a person in uniform commits such a serious crime of rape on a young 
girl in her late teens, there is no room for sympathy or pity. The punishment must in such cases 
be exemplary.

Introduction  
Chapter XVII (378 - 382) of Indian Penal Code,1860 deals with the Offences Against Property. 
Theft, in layman terms means the taking of a person’s property without the consent of the owner 
and Section 378 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC) has provided a proper legal definition of 
theft.  
Section -378  
Under this Section, Theft has been defined as the act of taking any immovable property with a 
dishonest intent and without the consent of the owner of such property. The Section further 
provides in the explanations given that any object attached to the earth would be considered as an 
immovable property hence it could not b e a subject of theft but once it is removed from the earth 
it would become a movable property and could be stolen. The consent that must be attained for a 
property to be taken without it being considered theft may either be express or implied.  
Prerequisite s of Theft  
Dishonest Intention  
Section 24 of IPC provides that dishonesty means the intention of wrongful gain or wrongful 
loss. Section 23 of the IPC provides the definition of both wrongful gain and wrongful loss. 
Wrongful gain means gaining any property unlawfully, the person who is losing the property is 
the legal owner of such property. Wrongful loss means the loss brought about by unlawful 
 means.  
In the case of  M/s. Shriram Transport Finance Co. Ltd. v. R. Khaishiullah Khan, payment for a 
hire-purchase agreement defaulted and the p roperty was seized and the court held that it would 
not constitute theft as the financer was entitled to seize such property. Further, there were no 
dishonest intentions.  
 
Movable Property  
Section 22 of IPC has provided the definition of movable property; means that any corporeal 
property except land and things permanently attached to the earth. Only movable property can be 
stolen as it is impossible to take immovable property away. Immovable property can be 
converted into movable property and once it has b een converted such property can be stolen.  
Electricity  
Electricity has been ruled to be immovable property according to the case of  Avtar Singh v. State 
of Punjab 1965 SCR (1) 103  but stealing of electricity has been made a punishable offence. The 
punishme nt for theft is provided under section 35 of Electricity Act, 2003 as up to three years of 
imprisonment with or without a fine.  
Data                                                      
Theft of personal data has become one of the biggest issues of the curr ent age. Data is intangible 
since it is only information thus it is incorporeal and does not come under the definition of theft 
given in Section 378 of IPC. If data is stored on some tangible object like a hard drive, then theft 
of such an object would be covered under this Section.  
Crops  
 Growing crops are attached to the earth and hence cannot be considered movable property but 
once they are converted into movable property by removing them from the earth, it can be 
considered as theft.  
Human Body  
The human  body cannot be considered to be movable property and hence Section 378 cannot be 
applied in case of theft of human body. But in case of instances where the body has been 
preserved or the skeleton has been kept, then such property is covered by Section 378  and falls 
under the definition of movable property.  
Property in possession  
In order for theft to have occurred, the property being stolen must be taken from the possession 
from the owner of such a property. If the property does not have an owner then such  property 
cannot be said to have been stolen if a person acquires such property. For example; if A finds a 
gold nugget in a stream and he takes the gold home, it cannot be considered theft as the gold 
nugget has no owner.  
No Consent  
The property that is in  question must have been taken without the consent of the owner of such a 
property. The consent can either be implied or express. The consent given must also be free 
meaning that such consent must not be acquired through means of coercion or fear of injury  or 
misrepresentation of facts.  
Consent given during state of drunkenness or intoxication as well as consent given by a person of 
unsound mind cannot be considered to be a valid consent.  
In Pyarelal Bhargava v. State, , a govt. employee took a file from the government office and 
presented it to B, and brought it back to the office after two days. Held that permanent taking of

 Introduction  
Chapter XVII of the Indian Penal Code deals with the offences against property. Sections 403 
and 404 under the said Chapter of the Code are relating to the offences of Criminal 
Misappropriation of Property. Section 403 specifically deals with dishonest misappropriation of 
property and section 404 provides for dishonest misappropriation of property possessed by 
deceased person at the time of his death.  
Section  403 
Section 403 provides that an offence of criminal misappropriation of property is said to be 
constituted if any person dishonestly misappropriates or converts the movable property of 
another for his own use. Therefore, the essentials of criminal misapp ropriation of property 
according to section 403 are - 
1. Dishonest misappropriations or conversion of property of another for his own use by the 
accused  
2. The property so misappropriated or converted shall be movable in nature.  
The provision mandates that there shall be misappropriation or conversion of property by the 
accused, if the accused has merely retained the property in his possession, then it shall not 
constitute to be an offence under section 403.  
The Court held that, if a person picked up a purse  in a temple in the crowded gathering and put it 
in his pocket, but he was immediately arrested. Then such an offence of picking up the purse and 
not misappropriating the property for his own use shall not amount to offence under section 403 
of the IPC.  
In the case of  Ramaswami Nadar v. State of Madras AIR 1957 , the Supreme Court held that the 
words used in section 403 such as ‘converts to his own use’ necessarily connotes that the accused 
has used or dealt with the property in derogation of the rights of t he owner of the property.  
 Difference from Theft  
Criminal Misappropriation of property is distinguished from the offence of theft. The offence of 
theft and criminal misappropriation of property have the aspect of dishonesty in common. But in 
case of theft m ere moving of the property from the possession of owner is sufficient to constitute 
the offence, whereas, to prove the offence of criminal misappropriation of property the intention 
of the accused to convert or misappropriate the property so dishonestly ta ken into possession 
should also be established.  
The provision under section 403 provides for two explanations to it. They are - 
Explanation 1 - 
This explanation deals with the cases of ‘dishonest misappropriation’ only. The explanation 
clarifies the scope of  the working of the section, as it includes both temporary and permanent 
misappropriation.  
Explanation 2 - 
This explanation describes the rights of a founder of goods along with his liabilities in certain 
cases. The explanation clarifies that the property which is abandoned by the owner and the 
founder with all reasonable efforts was unable to find the true owner who has used the property 
for his own use. Then, the founder of the property cannot be held guilty of an offence under 
section 403. But the founde r is held guilty if he had knowledge of the owner of the property or 
had all means to discover the owner and utilised none of the means to find the owner.  
Further, section 403 imposes punishment on the persons who have committed the offence of 
criminal mis appropriation of property. The punishment shall be imprisonment of a term which 
may extend to two years or fine or both.  
Section 404 - 
 Section 404 provides for criminal misappropriation of property is a specified case, that is in case 
of the property which was possessed by a deceased person at the time of his death. This section 
prescribes the following essentials - 
1. Dishonest misappropriation or conversion of property  
2. The property must have been in the possession of a deceased person at the time of his death  
3. After the death of the person in possession of the property, the person who is legally entitled to 
take the possession of the property has not been given with the possession  
Further, the section can be divided into two parts - 
1. Cases where the of fence under section 404 is committed by any person  
2. Cases where the offence under section 404 is committed by a person who was employed as a 
clerk or a servant under the person deceased having the property in possession.  
In the former cases, the punishme nt prescribed under the section is imprisonment of a term 
which may extend to 3 years and shall also be liable to fine. In latter cases, the punishment shall 
be imprisonment which may extend to the term of 7 years along with liability to pay fine.  
In the case of  State of Orissa v. Bishnu Charan Muduli  1985 Cr LJ 1573 , the Supreme Court 
held that, where the Head Constable who had forcefully taken the articles to his custody from a 
boatman, who had previously recovered those articles from a dead body of a dr owned person, 
keeps those articles in his possession dishonestly. Then, the officer who was holding the articles 
of a deceased person dishonestly was held guilty of an offence under section 404.  
Section 404 does not specify as to the nature of property whe ther it must be movable or 
immovable. The Courts have unanimously observed that the section shall apply only in cases of 
movable property while deciding many cases.  
 Keeping in view the above -mentioned provisions of IPC it can be concluded that the criminal  
misappropriation of property is an offence which requires dishonest misappropriation or 
conversion of a movable property by the accused.

 INTRODUCTION  
The Indian Penal Code of 1860 under Chapter XVII provides for offences against property. 
Criminal breach of trust is considered as an offence against property under this Chapter and 
Sections 405 to 409 deals with the specific provisions concerning the criminal breach of trust.  
The definition of criminal breach of trust provided under Section 405 can be construed as any 
dishonest use or disposition of property by one person upon whom t he other person has entrusted 
his property and owing to this dishonest use or disposition the latter should have suffered breach 
of trust as the act must have been committed in discharge of such trust.  
Essentials:  
The essential ingredients of the offence o f criminal breach of trust are - 
1. Entrustment of property  
2. Dishonest intention of the accused  
3. Misappropriation of property so entrusted or converted the property to own use of the accused 
to the detriment of the person who has entrusted it on the accused.  
In the case of  Ramaswamy Nadar v. State of Madras  AIR 1957 SC,  the Supreme Court held that 
the aspect of entrustment in the cases of criminal breach of trust is very important, unless there 
exists entrustment, there can be no offence under section  405 of IPC.  
Punishment:  
Section 406 prescribes punishment if the offence under section 405 is proved. Section 406 
provides that any person who has committed an offence of criminal breach of trust shall be 
punished with either imprisonment of a term which may extend to 3 years or fine or both.  
Classification of offence:  
 Criminal breach of trust is classified as a compoundable offence, but the offence is 
compoundable only by the owner of the property who has entrusted the property with the 
accused and the ow ner must take prior permission of the court. Further, the offence of criminal 
breach of trust is classified to be a cognizable and non - bailable offence which is triable by 
Magistrate of the first class.  
In the case of  Jaswantrai Manilal Akhaney v. State o f Bombay 1956 SCR 483 , the Supreme 
Court considered the relationship between the owner of the property and the accused in cases of 
criminal breach of trust as the relationship between the transferor and transferee. Under the 
circumstances of a criminal breach of trust, the transferor remains to be the owner of the property 
and only the legal custody of the property will be entrusted with the accused for the benefit of the 
transferor. Therefore, transferee in these cases only acquires a special interest i n the property 
which is entrusted with him and acquires no right to dispose of that property. Any act in 
contravention of the condition imposed by the transferor is considered as criminal breach of 
trust.  
Sections 407 to 409  
Sections 407 to 409 provides fo r criminal breach of trust by specified individuals, where - 
 Section 407 provides for the criminal breach of trust committed by carrier, wharfinger 
or warehouse -keeper,  
 Section 408 provides for the criminal breach of trust committed by clerk or servant, 
and 
 Section 409 provides for the criminal breach of trust committed by a public servant, or 
by banker, merchant or agent.  
Section 407  
The offence of criminal breach of trust under Section 407 must be committed by either of the 
following individuals - 
 1. Carrie r, 
2. Wharfinger, or  
3. Warehouse -keeper.  
Further, the provision prescribes punishment in case of criminal breach of trust committed by the 
above -mentioned individuals. This provision imposes a higher level of liability on the offenders 
and prescribes more  intensive punishment than the punishment prescribed for an offence under 
sections 405 and 406. The punishment under section 407 shall be imprisonment which may 
extend to a term of seven years and the convict shall also be liable to fine.  
Illustration: Sam  is a warehouse -keeper.  Ram entrusts his office furniture with  Sam,  while he 
goes on a foreign tour for 2 months. The entrustment was made under a contract where  Ram had 
agreed to pay a sum of Rs. 5000/ - as stipulated by  Sam towards warehouse room charges for 2 
months.  Sam dishonestly sells the furniture after 1 month.  Sam has committed criminal breach of 
trust.  
Section 408  
Under section 408, criminal breach of trust shall be committed by the following individuals - 
1. Clerk or  
2. Servant  
The offence of crim inal breach of trust by the above -mentioned persons maybe committed in 
respect of the entrustment with any property or with dominion over the property.  
Further, section 408 imposes similar punishment as imposed in the cases under section 407. 
Hence, the pu nishment under section 408 shall be imprisonment which may extend to a term of 
seven years and the person who commits the offence shall also be liable to fine.  
 Section 409  
Section 409 states that an offence of criminal breach of trust under this provision shall be 
committed by the following persons - 
1. Public servant  
2. Banker  
3. Merchant  
4. Factor  
5. Broker  
6. Attorney or  
7. Agent  
Criminal breach of trust must be in respect of entrustment with any property or with any 
dominion over property.  
The section further provides for punishment in case of criminal breach of trust by the specified 
individuals. The punishment shall be imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years and 
shall also be liable to fine.  
In the case of  Sadhupati Nageswara Rao v. State  of Andhra Pradesh  AIR 2012 SC , the 
Supreme Court observed that in cases under Section 409, the prosecution should prove that the 
accused was entrusted with the property of which he is duly bound to account for and that he 
committed criminal breach of trus t. 
 In the light of all the afore -mentioned provisions of IPC, it is clarified that the most important 
requirement in case of criminal breach of trust is entrustment with any property by the owner to 
the accused. Without the existence of such entrustment, t he offence of criminal breach of trust 
cannot be proved.
