Meaning  
Crime may be defined as an act or omission, which the society has  of thought fit to punish or 
otherwise deal with under its laws for the time being in force. The different acts and or omissions 
so punishable under the law are known as crimes.  
Blackstone de fined crime as “an act committed or omitted in violation of public law forbidding 
or commanding it”. According to Glanville Williams “a crime is a legal wrong that can be 
followed by criminal proceedings which may result in punishment”. Professor Kenny def ined 
crimes in the following terms: “Crime is a harmful human conduct that sovereign desires to 
prevent.” Salmond defines crime as “an act deemed by law to be harmful to society in general 
even though its immediate victim is an individual”. John Austin def ines crime “a wrong which is 
pursued by the sovereign or his subordinates is a crime .” 
 
 
Essential Elements of Crime :  
The cardinal principle of criminal law is contained in the maxim ‘actus non facit reum, nisi 
mens sit rea’ . It means an act does not make a person guilty of a crime unless the mind is also 
guilty.  
The general rule of English law states that a person will be criminally liable if he has committed 
a prohibited act, which is by a certain state of mind. Clearly, t here is a difference between an 
accident which cause injury and a deliberate act which injures another. The difference may not 
be in the act, but in the state mind of the actor. However, certain crimes do not require any 
particular state of mind. These cri mes are classified as strict liability offences. They are an 
exception to the requirement of mens rea.  
Often, in criminal law, a crime is committed when there is a combination of actus reus and mens 
rea. The actus reus for each crime must be established. It is not enough that mens rea for the 
crime was present, if actus reus was not committed as well. The main reason for this is that 
criminal law insists on some expression of someone’s criminal thoughts through their actions 
before it will intervene to pun ish them. Moreover, there is no criminal liability for possessing a 
particular state of mind. Mens Rea and deliberate conduct  by the accused is essential to 
constitute offence.  
 
Actus Reus :  
It is the deed of commission, a result of active conduct of the offender. The word Actus denotes a 
deed, a material result of human conduct. When the criminal policy regards such a deed as 
sufficiently harmful, it prohibits it and seeks to prevent its occurrence by imposing a penalty for 
its commission. Thus, Actus Reu s may be defined as such result of human conduct as the law 
seeks to prevent. It is important to note that the actus reus, which is the result of conduct and 
therefore an event, must be distinguished from the conduct which produced the result. For 
example,  in a case of murder, the death of the victim is brought by stabbing. Here the actus reus 
is homicide which is brought by the conduct of the offender i.e. stabbing.  
There may be situations where the law commands or permits the harm to be inflicted. In suc h 
cases the act done does not amount to offence. For example: a duly appointed executioner who 
puts to death a condemned criminal. No criminal liability arises in such cases.  
 
Causation  
There may be several causes of an event. It is however reasonable to say that an event may be 
caused by one of these factors if it would not have happened without that factor. From this it 
would follow that a man can be said to have caused the actus reus of a crime if that actus would 
not have occurred without his participa tion in what was done. The ancient rule of strict liability 
required no more than this test. However, with modern day conception of mens rea no hardship 
could result from the investigation of causes since the more remote the cause, the greater the 
difficul ty of proving that the accused person intended or realized what the effect of it would be.  
The physical element in criminal liability can be assessed under the following heads:  
(i) When there is no physical participation : A man can be held fully liable even 
though there is no physical participation in the act. Thus, law from very early times 
attached to one who procures or advises another to commit a crime at least an equal 
responsibility with that of the actual perpetrat or of the deed. The law dealing with 
such situations is dealt under the heads of incitement and conspiracy.  
(ii) Where the participation is indirect : The actus reus is fully attributed to anyone who 
has done things which have led or allowed some wholly innocen t person to act under 
mistake so as to cause harm in question. An example would be: A puts poison into a 
drink which he knows or expects that B will offer to C.  
(iii) Where another person has intervened:  In certain cases, it would seem that the harm 
could not h ave occurred but for an act or omission on the part of the offender, but in 
which he has been excused on the ground that some other person intervened and s 
appeared to have more immediate and direct cause of harm. In  R v. Hilton , on an 
indictment of mansla ughter, it appeared that the prisoner who was in charge of a 
steam engine had stopped the engine and gone away. During his absence some 
unauthorized person had set the engine in motion after the prisoner had gone away. 
The judge held that the death was the  consequence, not of the act of the prisoner but 
of the because of the because of the person who had set the engine in motion after the 
driver had gone away.  
(iv) Where victim’s own conduct has affected the result : Although there is no definite 
test laid down by any authority it would seem that so long as it is reasonably certain 
that the result charged against the offender in the indictment (a) would have occurred 
even if nothing was done subsequently by the victim (b) did occur although it might 
have been ave rted if the victim had taken some remedial action, then the prisoner 
offender be convicted. In cases where the victim’s conduct has affected the result, the 
benefit of it must go the offender. In R v. Martin  the prisoner was charged with the 
manslaughter o f his 4 -year-old son by giving it gin. It appeared that he had held out a 
glass to a little boy who snatched the glass and drank nearly the whole of the liquor 
which brought about its death shortly. The prisoner was acquitted on the grounds that 
the death followed because of the act of the child.  
(v) Contributory negligence of the victim:  that the victim of an offence has contributed 
to the harm by his own negligence affords no such defence to the accused in criminal 
proceedings as it may do in a civil action.  In R v. Swindall and Oshborne, it appeared 
that the prisoners were driving a horse and cart on the public road and encouraging 
each other to drive at a dangerous pace. In the course of this, they ran over and killed 
a pedestrian. It was held that it is im material whether the deceased was drunk or 
negligent, or in part contributed to his own death.   
 
 
 
Mens Rea  
Mens rea means the  evil intent or  guilty state of the mind. It refers to psychological state  or 
desire of the offender to bring about a contemplat ed result. Two tests have evolved to determine 
the mens rea in a particular case:  
i. Whether the act in question is a voluntary act of the accused? (Section 39 of IPC defines 
voluntarily)  
ii. Whether the accused had foresight of the consequences of the conduct?  
 
There are different  degrees  of mens rea.  
Intention:  To intend is mind is to have a fixed purpose to reach a desired objective. The word 
intention is used to denote the state of mind of a man who not only foresees but also wills the 
possible consequences of his conduct. For example: If a man chops off the h ead of another, it is 
clear that he not only foresees his death but also wills to cause the death. There cannot be 
intention without the foreseeability of the consequences and willingness to turn foreseeability 
into reality.  
Knowledge:  Knowledge is the awareness on the part of the person concerned, indicating that his 
mind is aware of the possible consequences of his conduct. In Basdev v. State of Pepsu , it was 
observed that knowledge is an awareness of the consequences of the act. In man y cases intention 
and knowledge merge into each other and mean the same thing more or less and intention can be 
presumed from knowledge. The demarcating line between knowledge and intention is no doubt 
thin but it is not difficult to perceive that they con note different things . 
Recklessness : A man may foresee the possible or even probable consequence of his conduct, not 
desire them to happen and despite this knowingly runs the risk of bringing about unwished 
results. A man who is reckless may prefer that th e contemplated event shall not happen and does 
not desire for it to happen and does not act with the purpose that it shall happen. But despite this 
the person knowingly runs the risk.   
Negligence: When a man is negligent, he may not have foreseen the prob able or possible 
consequences of his actions. There is no foreseeability of possible consequences in negligence.  
The word negligence denotes such blame worthy inadvertence and the man who through his 
negligence has brought harm upon the other is under an obligation to make reparations to the 
victim. Under IPC, negligence has been incorporated very specifically to fasten liability in cases 
of death caused by negligence (Section 304A). Negligence is essentially a principle of tort law.  
 
Motive :  
Motive is the psychological phenomena which compels a person to do a particular act. For 
example: ambition, jealously, fear etc. Motive is something which leads or tempts the mind to 
indulge in an act or which compels the mind to do an act. According to Austin, moti ve is like a 
spring. It pushes the intention further. In contrast, intention is the aim of the act. Motive is 
something which triggers mens rea. Motive can be good or bad. For instance, a person may 
commit theft to feed poor people. His motive is good, i.e ., helping the poor. However, his 
intention is to commit a crime to achieve that motive. Motive may be relevant to find out the 
guilt if the accused but is not an ingredient of crime.  
 
 
Stages of Crime:  
1. Intention -   Intention is the first stage in the commission of an offence .  But the law does 
not take notice of an intention, mere intention to commit an offence not followed by any 
act, cannot constitute an offence. The obvious reason for not prosecuting the accused at 
this stage is that it is very difficult for the prosecution to prove the guilty mind of a 
person.  
 
2.  Preparation - Preparation is the second stage in the commission of a crime. It means to 
arrange the necessary measures for the commission of the intended criminal act. Intention 
alone or the intention followed by a preparation is not enough to constitute the crime. 
Preparation has not been made punishable because in most of the cases the prosecution 
has failed to prove that the preparations in the question were made for the commission of 
the particular crime.  However, there are exceptions to this rule. For certain offences, even 
the preparation is made punishable.  
 
3. Attempt - Attempt is the direct movement towards the commission of a crime after the 
preparati on is made. A person may be guilty of an attempt to commit an offence if he 
does an act which is more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence; and 
a person will be guilty of attempting to commit an offence even though the facts are such 
that the commission of the offence is impossible. There are three essentials of an attempt:  
 Guilty intention to commit an offence;  
 Some act done towards the commission of the offence;  
 The act must fall short of the completed offence  
 
 
4. Accomplishment or Completion - The last stage in the commission of an offence is its 
accomplishment or completion. If the accused succeeds in his attempt to commit the 
crime, he will be guilty of the complete offence and if his attempt is unsuccessful, he will 
be guilty of a n attempt only. For example, A fires at B with the intention to kill him, if B 
dies, A will be guilty for committing the offence of murder and if B is only injured, it will 
be a case of attempt to murder.  
 
 
Parties to crime :  
      The four parties to cri me at early common law were principals in the first degree, principals in 
the second degree, accessories before the fact, and accessories after the fact. These designations 
signified the following:  
 
 Principals in the first degree committed the crime.  
 Principals in the second degree were present at the crime scene and assisted in the 
crime’s commission.  
 Accessories before the fact were not present at the crime scene, but assisted in preparing 
for the crime’s commission.  
 Accessories after the fact helped  a party to the crime avoid detection and escape 
prosecution or conviction.   
In modern times, the parties to crime are principals and their accomplices, and accessories.   
The criminal act element required for accomplice liability is aiding, abetting, or assisting in 
the commission of a crime. In many jurisdictions, words are enough to constitute the 
accomplice  criminal act element, while mere presence at the scene without a leg al duty to act 
is not enough . The criminal intent element required for accomplice liability is either specific 
intent or purposely or general intent or knowingly.
