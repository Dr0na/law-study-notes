A person is presumed to know the nature and consequences of his act and is therefore, 
responsible for it in law. However,  there are some exceptions to this. Such provisions are 
dealt with in chapter IV of the Indian Penal Code from section 76 to 106. The general 
exceptions can be classified into two broad classes. First is excusable and the second is 
justifiable. Excusable d efences are those acts which are excused for want of necess ity of 
mens rea. In such cases the act is not criminal because the guilty intention is absent. In 
the case of justifiable defences the acts are not excused but justified. Here we are 
discussing abo ut

Mistake of law and mistake of facts  (Sections 76 and 79)  
 
The term mistake literally means commission or omission of an act ignorantly or 
unintentionally causing injury. It is an unconscious ignorance or forgetfulness of a fact, 
past or present, material to the contract or a belief. Mistake is one of the defences 
available to the accused to get exemption from criminal liability. A court has to 
determine his guilt on the basis of the believed facts and not on the real facts. Mistake 
negates the existence of a particular intent or foresight which penal law requires to make 
a person liable rather than actus reus. Mistake as an absolving factor a llows a court to 
look into the mental statues of the wrong doer. In order to exclude the criminal from the 
liability on the ground of mistake three conditions are to be  fulfilled,  
a. The state of things believed to exist would, if  true, 
b. have justified the act  done; the mistake must be reasonable;  and 
c. the mistake must relate to fact and not to  law 
 
Section 76 and 79 of Indian Penal Code deals with Mistake of law and Mistake 
of fact respectively. Both these mistake s are based on the maxim “ignorantia  facti 
excusat,  ignorantia juris non - excusat” means ignorance of fact excuses and ignorance 
of law does not excuse”.  
Section 76 excuses a person from criminal liability who is bound by law to do 
something and has done it or who in good faith, owing to a m istake of fact, believes that 
he is bound by law to do something and does it whereas section 79 absolves a person, 
who believes, by reason of mistake of fact and not by reason of mistake of law, in good 
faith, that his act would be justified by law. The si milarities between both the sections is 
that the  act must done based must be done due to  mistake of fact and the accused must 
have acted in good faith. The difference between two sections, is shown  in the words 
“bound by law” and “justified by law ”. These two sections, though identical and accord 
the same immunity, are distinct from each other.  
Under section, 76 a person believes himself bound by law to do a thing and 
thereby he thinks he is under legal compulsion to do a thing, whereas section 79 he acts 
because he thinks that he is justified in doing so and thereby believes that there is a legal 
justification for his action. The purpose of these sections is to provide protection from 
conviction to persons, who are bound by law or justified by law in doing  a particular act, 
but due to mistake of fact, in good faith, committed an offence.  
A plain reading of the wordings in section76 & 79 “who by reason of a mistake 
of fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith believes” reveals that the 
protect ion of the sections applies only to mistake of fact and not to mistake of law. If 
mistake of law is admitted as an exonerating factor, it is argued, every accused will take 
the plea of mistake of law as a defence and it will be difficult for prosecution to  refute it 
and to show affirmatively that the accused knew the law in question. Allowing mistake 
of law will also lead to the encouragement of ignorance of  law. 
However,  mistake of law, in limited circumstances, can serve as a defence to 
criminal  charges. The circumstances in which a mistake of law can serve as a defence  
include:  
 
i. When the law is not  published  
ii. When you relied upon a statute that was later overturned or held to be 
unconstitutional  
iii. When you relied upon a judicial  decision  
iv. When you relied upon  an interpretation by an appropriate  official  
 
In R v Tolson , The appellant married in Sept 1880. In Dec 1881 her husband 
went missing. She was told that he had been on a ship that was lost at sea. Seven years 
later, believing her husband to be dead, she m arried another. Sometime after her 
marriage, her first husband turned up. She was charged with the offence of bigamy. She 
was held not guilty since she was afforded the defence of mistake as it was reasonable in 
the circumstances to believe that her husban d was dead.  
However in R. v. Princ e, prince took a girl below the age of 16 years without the 
consent of the parents under the belief that she was above 16 years, which is an offence 
in England under Offences against persons Act, 1861. In this case he did n’t act in good 
faith because he failed to make enquiries to find out the actual age of the girl. He was 
convicted, even though; there is no mens  rea, for the offence of  kidnapping.  
 
In R v. Bailey  the accused was away from the cost of Africa, when a statu te was 
passed by the British parliament, and he could not have known by any means about the 
passing of the statute under which he was charged. The court held him guilty, 
disallowing his plea of want of knowledge of the law. R v. Wheat & Stock , the accused 
was an illiterate and he was miscommunicated that he had been granted divorce. 
Subsequently he remarried. His first wife charged him for bigamy. The court held him 
guilty of bigamy and convicted him. Tolsons case and wheats case are quite distinct 
from eac h other. In the first case accused was excused due to mistake of fact and the 
latter case,  there was a mistake of law, which is not excusable, and hence the accused 
was convicted.  
 
One of the essential ingredients required for an accused to get protection of 
section  76 and 79 is that his action must be done in good faith. Section 57 says about 
good faith where essential ingredient is due care and attention. Even if a person is honest 
in his intentions, he is expected to act with due care and caution. The de finition of good 
faith under the General Clauses Act is not applicable to an offence under the IPC. Due 
care denotes the degree of reasonableness in the care sought to be exercised. In State of 
West Bengal v. Shew Mangal Singh, a subordinate officer opened  fire in pursuance of the 
orders of the Commissioner of Police causing the death of some persons. Here the police  
person nel fired on a mob by the order of superior officer, in conformity with the 
commands of the law as well as in good faith. The supreme C ourt held if the order of the 
superior officer was justified and lawful there was no requirement of any further enquiry 
regarding the applicability of section Due care and caution principle requires three 
factors, firstly, the nature of the act committed b y the accused; secondly , its magnitude 
and importance, and thirdly , the facility a person has for the exercise of the care and  
attention . 
  
Accident ( Section 80 ) 
 
Section 80 exempts a person from criminal liability if, the act must have been 
done without any criminal intention or knowledge; the act alleged to have been done 
against the accused must be lawful; the act must have been done in a lawful manner by 
lawful means and with proper care and caution. To bring an act within the meaning of 
the term accident used in section 80, an essential requirement is that the happening of the 
incident cannot be attributed to human fault. It is something happens out of ordinary 
course of things. The word misfortune means the same thi ng as accident plus that it was 
as unwelcome as it was unexpected. It was only an accident with attendant evil 
consequences. Both these words “accident” and “misfortune” are used in the sense of 
implying the injury to another. In order to invoke this secti on, it must be proved that the 
act is done without any “criminal intent or knowledge”. It is mandatory to prove that the 
act is done without mens  rea or guilty mind. Thus , injuries caused due to accidents in 
sports and games are covered this  section.  
In Tunda v. Rex , two friends fond of wrestling participated in a wrestling match 
and one of them suffered injury which resulted in death of the other. The other person 
was charged under s 304 A IPC. The High Court held that when both agreed to wrestle 
with ea ch other, there was an implied consent on the part of each to suffer accidental 
injuries. In the absence of any proof of foul play, it was held that the act was accidental 
and unintentional.  
The section specifically mentions  that a lawful act in a lawful m anner by lawful 
means. If an act is lawful but done it through unlawful manner the section doesn’t have 
any application. Further the section emphasis act must be done with proper care and 
caution. What is expected is not utmost care, but sufficient care th at a prudent and 
reasonable man would consider adequate, in the circumstances of cases  
 
In Jagesher v. Empero r, the accused was beating a person with his fist. The 
latter’s wife intervened with two month old baby on her shoulder. The accused hit the 
 women also the blow struck the child on the head and it died from the effects of the 
blow. The accused was held liable, even though the child was hit by accident. The 
reason is that the accused was not doing a lawful act in a lawful manner by lawful 
means.  
In Bhupendra singh v. State of Gujarat , the accused constable, along with the 
head constable, was on patrol duty at a dam site, which was in danger on account of 
heavy rain fall. The accused took the plea that he saw a fire and hence fired. The accused 
close at  shot range without knowing the identity of his target. The Supreme Court held 
that the act was done without any care and caution. His conviction for murder was 
upheld and he was sentenced to life  imprisonment.  
 
Doctrine of Necessity (section 81)  
 
To invoke section 81 two ingredients must be satisfied such as, the  act must have 
been done under good faith; there must not be mens  rea (absence of mens  rea). It 
embodies the principle that where the accused chooses lesser evil, in order to avert the 
bigger, then he is immune. The genesis of this principle emanates from two maxims: 
quod necessitas non habet legum - necessity knows no law and necessitas vincit legum - 
necessity overcomes the law. This doctrine of necessity recognises that the law has to be 
broken to achieve a greater good. The illustration of the section explains lucidly how the 
doctrine of necessity works. It is pertinent to note that although section 81 does not 
specifically refer to greater evil or lesser evil, it in effect deals with the c ase of lesser  
evil.  
Section 80 and 81 are analogous provisions, the former dealing with accidents 
and the latter with inevitable accidents. Section 80 stipulates the absence of criminal 
intention as well as criminal knowledge. But section 81 stipulates the absence of 
criminal intention alone. In fact, section 81 clearly contemplates a situation where the 
accused has knowledge that he is likely to cause harm, but is specifically stipulated that 
such knowledge shall not be held against him.  The relevant leading case on this point is 
R v. D udly and Stephens  three seamen and a cabin boy were the crew of an English 
 vessel. Due to ship wreck, the three seamen and the boy escaped and were put into open 
boat. On 20th day, when they had no food for eight days and no water for five days, the 
accuse d killed the boy and fed on the flesh and blood for four days to survive. On the 
fourth day, they were picked up by a passing vessel and subsequently they were 
prosecuted for the offence of murder of the boy. The accused pleaded the defence of 
necessity to  get exemption from the criminal liability. The Privy Council held they are 
guilty for murder and convicted them on the ground of, self preservation is not an 
absolute necessity, no man has a right to take another’s life to preserve his own; and 
there is n o necessity that justifies homicide.  
Killing a person in self defence may appear to be an example of necessity. While 
self defence may overlap necessity, the two are not the same. Private defence operates 
only against aggressors. Generally, the aggressors are wrongdoers, while the person 
against whom action is taken by necessity, may not be an aggressor or wrongdoer. 
Unlike necessity, private defence involves no balancing of  values.  
In United States v. Holmes the accused was a member of the crew of a boat a fter 
a shipwreck. Fearing that the boat would sink, he under the order of the mate threw 16 
male passengers overboard. The accused though not convicted for murder, was 
convicted for manslaughter and sentenced to six months imprisonment with hard labour.  
In Gopal Naidu v. Emperor , a drunken m an was carrying a revolver in his hand 
was disarmed and put under restraint by the police officers, though the offence of public 
nuisance under section 290 was a non cognizable offence without a warrant. Though the 
polic e officer  were prima facie guilty of the offence of wrongful confinement, it was 
held that they could plead justifications under this section. Further added, the person or 
property to be protected may be the person or property of the accused himself or of 
others.  
 
Infancy (section – 82 and 83)  
 
These sections confer immunity from criminal liability on child offenders. It is 
 presumed that a child below the age of seven years is doli incapax . It means that such a 
child is incapable of doing a criminal act and  cannot form the necessary mens  rea to 
commit a crime. This presumption is conclusive and it emanates from the recognition of 
the fact that he lacks the adequate mental ability to understand the nature and 
consequences of his act and thereby an ability to form the required mens  rea. Even 
though there may be the clearest evidence that the child causes an actus reus with mens 
rea, he cannot be held guilty once it appears that he, at the time he committed the act, 
was below the seven years.  
Section 83 presumes that a child above seven but below 12 years of age is doli 
capax , capable to commit crime depending upon the maturity of understanding. But this 
presumption is not conclusive. The burden is upon the prosecution to prove beyond 
reasonabl e doubt that the child caused an actus reus with mens  rea and that he knew that 
his conduct was not merely mischievous but wrong. However, once the  court comes to a 
conclusion that the concerned child has not attained sufficient maturity of understanding,  
then the immunity conferred by section 83 is as absolute as that conferred by section 82.  
The principle of innocence is based on the principle of immaturity of intellect. 
The proof of attainment of sufficient maturity can be derived at by a court on the 
consideration of all the circumstances of the case. It can be inferred from the nature of 
the act and his subsequent conduct and other allied factors such as his demeanour and 
appearance in the court. It need not be proved by the prosecution by positive evidence. 
Beyond the age of 12, there is no immunity from criminal liability, even if the offe nder 
is a person of undeveloped and incapable of understanding the nature and consequences 
of his act. All these juvenile in conflict with law is now governed by Juvenile Justice 
Act, 2000.The perusal of JJ act mak es clear that it is not giving any punishm ent for 
juveniles but at the same time it is not exonerating the juveniles from criminal liability. 
But it would appear that something akin to immunity is provided to delinquent juveniles 
under this Act.  
In Ulla Mahapatra v. The Kin g, a boy eleven and belo w twelve picked up his 
knife and advanced towards another. He threatened the other by saying that he would cut 
him into bits and did actually what he said. It was held that he was having sufficient 
 maturity of understanding, because he did what he intended . 
In Walters v. Lunt   the parents of the child aged 7 years were charged with 
receiving from their son a Childs tricycle knowing it to have been stolen by their child. It 
was held th at the parents must be acquitted on the ground that, since the child could  not 
steel the tricycle was not stolen property.  
 
Insanity : (Section 84)  
In India,  Section 84  of IPC  describes the defences available to the person of an unsound 
mind. Persons of unsound minds are vulnerable in nature. There is a complete chance of their 
exploitation in a situation where they are not being sought protection.  The law that protects an 
unsound minded person and provides defence from criminal liability to the unsound minded 
person is known as the Law of Insanity. Whenever an insane person comm its a crime due to the 
effect of his insanity, he does not have a guilty mind to understand that what he is doing is 
something that is prohibited by law. The insanity law has proven to be of practical importance in 
understanding the situation and the menta l position of an insane person and in certain reasonable 
circumstances granted them exemption from criminal liability.  
According to the rule in the M’Naghten ’s case, it must be clearly demonstrated, in order 
to establish the defence of insanity, that the accused worked under a fault at the time of the act so 
much as to be unaware of the nature and quality of the act he was doing.  This explanation cannot 
be taken as a full definition of proof, as it fails to explain various aspects of insanity.  
It is theref ore imperative to note that the term “insanity” has a particular meaning in 
criminal law. It is not necessarily used in its medical sense, but its legal significance must be 
understood. Therefore, insanity as a defence refers to legal insanity and not medi cal insanity.  The 
concept of ‘legal insanity’ refers to certain requirements to be met by the accused according to 
the rules laid down in the law. Legal insanity is a narrower concept than medical insanity.  Legal 
insanity is a concept narrower than medica l insanity. For example, some mental illnesses such as 
schizophrenia, paranoia or lunacy may overlap with the legal and medical conceptions of 
insanity and may also be protected against insanity or insanity of mind when the other conditions 
are fulfilled i n order to satisfy legal insanity criteria.  
 Indian Law on the Defence of Insanity:  
 
Insanity is provided in accordance with Section 84 of the Indian Penal Code as a defence  
under Indian Law. However, the term “insanity” is not used under this provision. The Indian 
Penal Code uses the sentence “mental soundness.” In accordance with the code, the defence of 
insanity, or that can also be called defence of mental insanity, comes from M’Naghten’s rule.  
 
In Section 84 of the Indian Penal Code, a person of an un sound mind shall act - Nothing is 
an offence committed by someone who is currently unable to know the nature of the act or does 
what is wrong or contrary to legislation due to a lack of a sound mind.  
Nevertheless, it should be noted that the framers of the IPC preferred to use the expression 
“insanity of mind” instead of the term “insanity.” Insanity’s scope is very limited, while the 
mind’s insanity covers a large area.  
For this defence, the following elements are to be established - 
 The accused was in a sta te of unsoundness of mind at the time of the act.  
 He was unable to know the nature of the act or do what was either wrong or contrary 
to the law.  
The term ‘wrong’ is different from the term ‘contrary to the law.’  If anything is ‘wrong’, it is 
not necessar y that it would also be ‘contrary to the law.’ The legal conception of insanity 
differs significantly from medical conception. Not every form of insanity or madness is 
recognized as a sufficient excuse by law.  
 
Distinction between Legal and Medical Insanity :  
Section 84 of the Indian Penal Code sets out the legal responsibility test as 
distinguished from the medical test. It can be observed that the absence of will arises not 
only from the absence of understandi ng maturity but also from a morbid state of mind. This 
morbid mind condition, which provides an exemption from criminal responsibility, differs 
from the medical and legal point of view. According to the medical point of view, it is 
probably correct to say that every person, when committing a criminal act, is insane and 
therefore needs an exemption from criminal responsibility; while it is a legal point of view, a 
person must be held to be the same as long as he is able to distinguish between right and 
 wrong ; as long as he knows that the act carried out is contrary to the law.  
 
It has been ruled by the Supreme Court that “mentally ill” people and psychopaths are 
unable to seek immunity from a criminal case, as it is their responsibility to demonstrate 
insanit y at the time the crime was committed. So in practice, not every person who is 
mentally ill is exempt from criminal liability. There has to be a distinction between legal 
insanity and medical insanity. “Arijit Pasayat and the Bench of Justices, DK Jain, st ated 
while upholding the life conviction of a man who cut off his wife’s head. The mere 
abnormality of mind, partial delusion, irresistible impulse or compulsive behavior of a 
psychopath does not provide protection from criminal prosecution as provided by the apex 
court held Section 84 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The Bench stated that Section 84 of 
the IPC, which provides immunity from criminal prosecution to persons of unsound mind, 
would not be available to an accused, as the burden of proving insanit y would lie with them, 
as provided in Section 105 of the Indian Evidence.  
 
In the case of Hari Singh Gond v. State of Madhya Pradesh, the Supreme Court 
observed that Section 84 sets out the legal test of responsibility in cases of alleged mental 
insanity. There is no definition of ‘mind soundness’ in IPC. However, the courts have mainly 
treated this expression as equivalent to insanity. But the term ‘insanity’ itself does not have a 
precise definition. It is a term used to describe various degrees of mental  disorder. So, every 
mentally ill person is not ipso facto exempt from criminal responsibility. A distinction must 
be made between legal insanity and medical insanity. A court is concerned with legal 
insanity, not medical insanity.  
 
In the case of Surendra Mishra v. State of Jharkhand, It was pointed out that ‘every 
person suffering from mental illness is not ipso facto exempt from criminal liability.’ 
Furthermore, in the case of Shrikant Anandrao Bhosale v. State of Maharashtra, the Supreme 
Court, in determining the offense under Section 84 of the IPC, held that’ it is the totality of 
the circumstances seen in the light of the recorded evidence’ that would prove that the 
offense was committed.’ It was added: “The unsoundness of the mi nd before and after the 
incident is a relevant fact.”  
  
 Unsoundness of mind must be at the time of the commission of the Act.  
 
The first thing a court to be considered when defending insanity is whether the accused 
has established that he was unsound at the  time of committing the act. The word “insanity” is 
not used in Section 84 of the penal code.  
 
In Rattan Lal v. State of M.P , it was well established by the court that the crucial point of 
time at which the unsound mind should be established is the time wh en the crime is actually 
committed and whether the accused was in such a state of mind as to be entitled to benefit 
from Section 84 can only be determined from the circumstances that preceded, attended and 
followed the crime. In other words, it is the beha vior precedent, attendant and subsequent to 
the event that may be relevant in determining the mental condition of the accused at the time 
of the commission of the offense but not those remote in time.  
 
In Kamala Bhuniya v. West Bengal State, the accused wa s tried for her husband’s murder 
with an axis. A suit was filed against the accused, she alleged to be insane at the time of the 
incident, the investigating officer recorded at the initial stage about the accused’s mental 
insanity. The prosecution’s duty w as to arrange for the accused’s medical examination, it 
was held that there was no motive for murder. The accused made no attempt to flee, nor 
made any attempt to remove the incriminating weapon Failure on the part of the prosecution 
was to discharge his i nitial responsibility for the presence of mens -rea in the accused at the 
time of the commission of the offence. The accused was entitled to benefit from Section 84. 
And hence accused was proved insane at the time of the commission of the offence and was 
held guilty of Culpable Homicide and not of Murder.  
 
 Incapacity to know the nature of the act  
The word “incapacity to know the nature of the act” embodied in Section 84 of the Indian 
Penal Code refers to that state of mind when the accused was unable to appr eciate the effects 
of his conduct. It would mean that the accused is insane in every possible sense of the word, 
and such insanity must sweep away his ability to appreciate the physical effects of his acts.  
  Incapacity to know right or wrong  
In order to use  the defence of insanity under the latter part of Section 84, namely “or to 
do what is either wrong or contrary to the law,” it is not necessary that the accused should be 
completely insane, his reason should not be completely insane, his reason should not  be 
completely extinguished. What is required, is to establish that although the accused knew the 
physical effects of his act, he was unable to know that he was doing what was either “wrong” 
or “contrary to the law.” This part of Section 84 has made a new contribution to criminal law 
by introducing the concept of partial insanity as a defence against criminal insanity. 
However, as a practical matter, there would probably be very few cases in which insanity is 
pleaded in defence of a crime in which the disti nction between “moral” and “legal” error 
would be necessary. In any crime, insanity can undoubtedly be pleaded as a defence, yet it is 
rarely pleaded except in murder cases. Therefore, in a case, this fine distinction may not be 
very useful for the decisio n. The Indian penal code has advisably used either “wrong or 
contrary to the law” in Section 84, perhaps anticipating the controversy.  
 
Intoxication  
Intoxication is a state of mind in which a person loses self -control and his ability to judge. 
Intoxication  is a defence available to criminal defendant on the basis that, because of the 
intoxication, the defendant did not understand the nature of his/her actions or know what he/she 
was doing. The defence of intoxication typically depends on whether the intoxic ation was 
voluntary or involuntary and what level of intent is required by the criminal charge. Under the 
Indian Penal Code the criminal liability under intoxication is mentioned under section 85 and 86.  
Section 85: Act of a person incapable of judgment by  reason of intoxication caused against his 
will. — Nothing is an offence which is done by a person, who at the time of doing it, is, by reason 
of intoxication, incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either 
wrong, or contrar y to law: provided that the thing which intoxicated him was administered to 
him without his knowledge or against his will.  
Section 86: Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is 
intoxicated. —In cases where an act done is not  an offence unless done with a particular 
knowledge or intent, a person who does the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be 
 dealt with as if he had the same knowledge as he would have had if he had not been intoxicated, 
unless the thing which  intoxicated him without his knowledge or against his will.  
Section 85 deals with offences committed under the influence of drugs or alcohol which 
is caused by fraud or coercion. Section 86 deals with intoxication which is self -induced.  Bablu 
alias Mubarik  Hussain V. State of Rajasthan , in this case SC examined Section 85 of IPC and 
held that evidence of drunkenness, the evidence which proves that the accused is incapable of 
forming the wrongful intent has also been considered along with the other facts, an d then it 
should be proved of the accused person has the intention to commit crime. These sections do not 
protect someone who voluntarily consumed intoxicants as the person loses his mental ability 
because of his consensual act i.e. by self -induced intoxic ation.  
 
The Right to Private Defence (Sections 96 -106) 
 
If a person does an act while exercising his right of private defence, his act would be no 
offence (Section 96). Right of private defence is based upon the instinct of self -preservation. 
This instinct  is vested in every human being and has been recognised by the law in all the 
civilized countries. The need for self -preservation is rooted in the doctrine of necessity.  
 
Common law has always recognised the right of a person to protect himself from 
attack  and to act in defence of others. In this process, he can inflict violence on another, if 
necessary. The person who is about to be attacked does not have to wait for the assailant to 
attack first.  
The right of private defence of people is recognised in al l free, civilised and democratic 
societies within certain reasonable limits. Those limits are dictated in two considerations :  
 
i. Every member of the society can claim this right  
ii. That the state takes responsibility for the maintenance of law and order  
 
 
  This right of private defence is preventive and not p
