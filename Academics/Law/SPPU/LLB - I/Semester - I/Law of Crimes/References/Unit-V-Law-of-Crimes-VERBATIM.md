Definition  
 
The word  'attempt' is not defined in the Indian Penal Code. According to Oxford Dictionary 
'attempt' means 'earnest and conscientious activity intended to do' or 'accomplish something'.  
 
Every commission of a crime has three stages:  
1. Intention to commit it;  
2. Preparation for its commission; and  
3. A successful attempt.  
If the attempt to commit a crime is successful, then the crime itself is committed; but where the 
attempt is not followed by the intended consequences, Section 511 of the Indian Penal Code ( in 
short IPC ) applies which is read as follows:  
 
Section 511 . Punishment for attem pting to commit offences punishable with imprisonment for 
life or other imprisonment. - Whoever attempts to commit an offence punishable by this Code 
with imprisonment for life or imprisonment, or to cause such an offence to be committed, and in 
such attemp t does any act towards the commission of the offence, shall, where no express 
provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such attempt, be punished with 
imprisonment of any description provided for the offence, for a term which may extend to one -
half of the imprisonment for life or, as the case may be, one -half of the longest term of 
imprisonment provided for that offence, or with such fine as is provided for the offence, or with 
both.   
 
Ingredients of Section 511    
 The ingredients of Section 511 a re: 
1. Offence punishable with imprisonment for life or imprisonment;  
2. Does any act towards the commission of the offence;  
3. No express provision is made by the Code for the punishment of such attempt.  
Attempt is the direct movement towards the commission after the preparations are made. Mere  
intention to commit a crime, not followed by any act, does not constitute an offence. Only such 
attempts are punishable under Section 511 for which no express provision is made by the Code.  
The same has been mentioned under the Section with the help of two illustrations a & b as 
follows;  
(a) “A” makes an attempt to steal some jewels by breaking open a box, and finds after so 
opening the box that there is no jewel in it. He has done an act towards the commission of theft 
and t herefore is guilty under this section.  
(b) “A” makes an attempt to pick the pocket of “Z” by thrusting his hand into Z’s pocket. A fails 
in the attempt in consequence of Z’s having nothing in his pocket. A is guilty under this section.  
Both of these illustrations are an example of an attempt to commit the offence as mentioned 
under the section.   However in the first illustration, if A prepares himself with a hammer to break 
the box in order to steal the jewel, but does nothing to break the box, then h e cannot be held 
liable for an attempt to commit the offence of stealing.  
Section 511 of the Indian Penal Code is a  general  section that makes punishable all attempts to 
commit offences punishable with imprisonment for life or imprisonment excepting those 
punishable with death or with fine only. Section 511, IPC provides for punishment for an attempt 
to commit an offence under the Penal Code. The very policy underlying in Section 511, IPC 
seems to be for providing it as a residuary provision. It does not ap ply to offence under special or 
local laws.  
 
In Satvir Singh vs. State of Punjab AIR 2001 SC 2828 , it was observed that Section 511 of the 
Indian Penal Code makes attempt to commit an offence punishable. The offence attempted 
 should be one punishable by th e Code with imprisonment. The conditions stipulated in the 
provision for completion of the said offence are - (i) the offender should have done some act 
towards commission of the main offence; (ii) such attempt is not expressly covered as a penal 
provision elsewhere in the Code. Thus attempt on the part of the accused is  sine qua non  for the 
offence under Section 511, IPC. If the act of the accused asking his wife/victim to go and 
commit  suicide  had driven her to proceed to the railway track for ending her life then it is 
expressly made punishable under Section 498A of the IPC. Section 498A, IPC makes cruelty as 
a punishable offence. One of the categories included in the Explanation to the said Section (by 
which the word cruelty is defined) is thus:  (a) Any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is 
likely to drive the woman to commit  suicide  or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or 
health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; when it is so expressly made punishable the 
act involved therei n stands lifted out of the purview of Section 511, IPC.  
 
In Abhayanand Mishra vs. State of Bihar AIR 1961 SC 1698 , the appellant applied to the 
Patna University for permission to appear at the 1954 M.A. Examination in the English as a 
private candidate rep resenting that he was a graduate having obtained his B.A. degree in 1951 
and that he had been teaching in a certain school. He attached bogus certificates in this regard. 
The University gave the permission and issued admit -card. In the meantime, however, t he 
University came to know about the forged application of the applicant.  
The issue before the Court was whether appellant was guilty of an 'attempt to cheat' the 
University, under Section 415, IPC, in as much as he, by making false representation, deceive d 
the University and induced the authorities to issue admit -card. The arguments on behalf of the 
appellant was that what he did was just a preparation and not an attempt to cheat; further, admit -
card was not property and had no pecuniary value in itself.  
The Apex Court observed that a person commits the offence of 'attempt to commit a particular 
offence' when (i) he, intends to commit that particular offence; and (ii) he, having made 
preparations and with the intention to commit the offence, does an act tow ards its commission; 
such an act need not be the penultimate act towards the commission of that offence but must be 
an act during the course of committing that offence.  
The Court held that appellant did deceive the University, as a dishonest concealment of  facts is a 
deception and thus cheating under Section 415, IPC. Admit -card is a 'property' as it has immense 
 value to a candidate. It is not true that appellant did not go beyond the stage of preparation. The 
preparation was complete when he had prepared t he application for the purpose of submission to 
the University. The moment he dispatched it, he entered the realm of attempting to commit the 
offence of cheating. He did  succeed  in deceiving the University and inducing it to issue the 
admit -card. He just f ailed to get it and sit for the examination because something beyond his 
control took place inasmuch as the University was informed about his being neither a graduate 
nor a teacher.  
An act done with intent to commit that crime and forming part of a series of acts which would 
constitute its actual commission if it were not interrupted. The point at which such a series of 
acts begins cannot be defined, but depends upon the circumstances of each particular case  and 
accordingly set the test for distinguishing attempt from preparation.  
 
Adultery

4. Conclusion  
 
Introduction and meaning  
Adultery is a voluntary sexual intercourse between a married person and someone other than the 
lawful spouse. The term originates from the Latin word ad -ulterare meaning on the other side of 
the bond of marriage. Adultery is defined under law as a consensual physical correlation between 
two individuals who are not married to each other and either or both are married t o someone else. 
The actual definition of adultery may vary in different jurisdictions but the basic theme is sexual 
relations outside marriage. Adultery, also known as infidelity or extra -marital affair is certainly a 
moral crime and is thought -out a sin b y almost all religions.  Adultery  is  a  "voluntary  sexual  
intercourse  between  a  married person and someone other  than  the  lawful  spouse." The  term  
originates  from  the  Latin  word  ad -ulterare  (a combination  of  ad,  "at",  and  ulter,  "ab ove",  
"beyond", "opposite",  meaning  "on  the  other  side  of  the  bond  of  marriage"Adultery  is  a  
 "voluntary  sexual  intercourse  between  a married person and someone other  than  the  lawful  
spouse." The  term  originates  from  the  Latin  wo rd  ad -ulterare  (a combination  of  ad,  "at",  
and  ulter,  "above",  "beyond", "opposite",  meaning  "on  the  other  side  of  the  bond  of  
marriage")   
Section 497 of the IPC reads as follows:  
497. Adultery. —Whoever has sexual intercourse with a pers on who is and whom he knows or 
has reason to believe to be the wife of another man, without the consent or connivance of that 
man, such sexual intercourse not amounting to the offence of rape, is guilty of the offence of 
adultery, and shall be punished wit h imprisonment of either description for a term which may 
extend to five years, or with fine, or with both. In such case the wife shall not be punishable as 
an abettor.  
Ingredients:  
In order to constitute the offence of adultery, the following must be esta blished: – 
(i) Sexual intercourse between a married woman and a man who is not her husband;  
(ii) The man who has sexual intercourse with the married woman must know or has reason to 
believe that she is the wife of another man;  
(iii) Such sexual intercourse must take place with her consent, i.e., it must not amount to rape;  
(iv) Sexual intercourse with the married woman must take place without the consent or 
connivance of her husband.  
 
After stating the ingredients as mentioned above, the Supreme Court in Jos eph Shine goes on to 
discuss the vice of unconstitutionality inherent in the offence of adultery, as may be seen 
presently.  
 
 
 
Who  may file a complaint  
 Only husband of the woman with whom adultery is committed is treated as an aggrieved person 
and only he can file a complaint. However, in his absence, some other person who had care of 
the woman on his behalf at the time when such offence was committed may  file a complaint on 
husband’s behalf if the court allows. [Section 198(2) CrPC]  
In Joseph Shine, this was held to be arbitrary and violative of constitutional guarantees as is 
discussed below.  
 
Woman  has no right  to file a complaint  
A wife is disabled fro m prosecuting her husband for being involved in an adulterous relationship. 
The law does not make it an offence for a married man to engage in an act of sexual intercourse 
with a single woman,  Joseph  Shine  v. Union  of India , 2018.  
 
Who  can be prosecuted  
It is only the adulterous man who can be prosecuted for committing adultery, and not the 
adulterous woman, even though the relationship is consensual. The adulterous woman is not 
even considered to be an abettor to the offence. Woman is exempted from crimina l liability.  
Presence of an adequate determining principle for such classification was doubted in   Joseph  
Shine . 
 
Woman  treated  as property  of man  
 
Historically, since adultery interfered with the “husband’s exclusive entitlements”, it was 
considered to be the “highest possible invasion of property”, similar to theft.  
  
On a reading of Section 497, it is demonstrable that women are treated as subordinate to men 
inasmuch as it lays down that when there is connivance or consent of the man, there is no 
offence. This treats the woman as a chattel. It treats her as the property of man and totally 
subservient to the will of the master. It is a reflection of the social dominance that was prevalent 
when t he penal provision was drafted,  Joseph  Shine  v. Union  of India , 2018.  
  
Section  497 violates  Articles  14 [Equality  before  law] 
  
Section 497 treats men and women unequally, as women are not subject to prosecution for 
adultery, and women cannot prosecute the ir husbands for adultery. Additionally, if there is 
“consent or connivance” of the husband of a woman who has committed adultery, no offence can 
be established. The section lacks an adequately determining principle to criminalise consensual 
sexual activity  and is manifestly arbitrary and therefore violative of Article 14,  Joseph  
Shine  v. Union  of India,2018.  
  
Section  198(2)  CrPC  also violates  Article  14 [Equality  before  law] 
 
Section 198(2) CrPC does not consider the wife of the adulterer as an aggrieved p erson. The 
rationale of the provision suffers from the absence of logicality of approach and therefore it 
suffers from the vice of Article 14 of the Constitution being manifestly arbitrary,  Joseph  
Shine  v. Union  of India , 2018.  
  
 
 
 
Violation  of Article  15(1) [Prohibition  of discrimination]  
 
Article 15(1) prohibits the State from discriminating on grounds only of sex. A husband is 
considered an aggrieved party by the law if his wife engages in sexual intercourse with another 
man, but the wife is not, if her  husband does the same. Viewed from this angle, the offence of 
adultery discriminates between a married man and a married woman to her detriment on the 
ground of sex only. The provision is discriminatory and therefore, violative of Article 
15(1),  Joseph  Shine v. Union  of India , 2018.  
  
Violation  of dignity  of woman  and Article  21 [Right  to life] 
 
 Dignity of the individual is a facet of Article 21. Section 497 effectually curtails the essential 
dignity which a woman is entitled to have by creating invidious distinctions based on gender 
stereotypes which creates a dent in the individual dignity of women.  
Besides, the emphasis on the element of connivance or consent of the husband tantamount to the 
subordination of women. Therefore, the same offends Article 21,  Joseph  Shine  v. Union  of 
India , 2018.  
  
Violation  of right  to privacy  and right  to choose  
This Court has recognised sexual privacy as a natural right, protected under the Constitution. 
Sharing of physical intimacies is a reflection of choice. To shackle the sexual freedom of a 
woman and allow the criminalisation of consensual relationships is a denial of this right,  Joseph  
Shine  v. Union  of India , 2018.  
  
Married  woman’s  sexual  agency  rendered  wholly  dependent  on consent  or connivance  of 
husband  
 
A man wh o has sexual intercourse with a married woman without the consent or connivance of 
her husband, is liable to be prosecuted for adultery even if the relationship is based on consent of 
the woman. Though granted immunity from prosecution, a woman is forced t o consider the 
prospect of the penal action that will attach upon the individual with whom she engages in a 
sexual act. To ensure the fidelity of his spouse, the man is given the power to invoke the criminal 
sanction of the State. In effect, her spouse is empowered to curtail her sexual agency,  Joseph  
Shine  v. Union  of India , 2018.  
  
Section  497 denudes  woman’s  sexual  autonomy  
 
Section 497 denudes a woman of her sexual autonomy in making its free exercise conditional on 
the consent of her spouse. In doing s o, it perpetuates the notion that a woman consents to a 
limited autonomy on entering marriage. The enforcement of forced female fidelity by curtailing 
sexual autonomy is an affront to the fundamental right to dignity and equality,  Joseph  
Shine  v. Union  of India , 2018.  
   
Opposed  to “constitutional  morality”  
 
It is not the common morality of the State at any time in history, but rather constitutional 
morality, which must guide the law. In any democracy, constitutional morality requires the 
assurance of certai n rights that are indispensable for the free, equal, and dignified existence of all 
members of society. A commitment to constitutional morality requires enforcement of the 
constitutional guarantees of equality before the law, non -discrimination on account of sex, and 
dignity, all of which are affected by the operation of Section 497,  Joseph  Shine  v. Union  of 
India , 2018.  
Premised  on sexual  stereotypes  
Section 497 is premised upon sexual stereotypes that view women as being passive and devoid 
of sexual agency. The notion that women are ‘victims’ of adultery and therefore require the 
beneficial exemption has been deeply criticized by feminist scholars, who argue that such an 
understanding of the position of women is demeaning and fails to recognize them a s equally 
autonomous individuals in society,  Joseph  Shine  v. Union  of India , 2018.  
  
Breakdown  of marriage  
In many cases, a sexual relationship by one of the spouses outside of the marriage may lead to 
the breakdown of marriage. But often, such a relations hip may not be the cause but the 
consequence of a pre -existing disruption of the marital tie,  Joseph  Shine  v. Union  of India , 2018.  
  
Case  of pending  divorce  proceedings  
Manifest arbitrariness is writ large even in case of a married woman whose marriage ha s broken 
down, as a result of which she no longer cohabits with her husband, and may, in fact, have 
obtained a decree for judicial separation against her husband, preparatory to a divorce being 
granted. If during this period, she has sex with another man, the other man is immediately guilty 
of the offence,  Joseph  Shine  v. Union  of India , 2018.  
 
Whether  adultery  should  be treated  as a criminal  offence?  
 Adultery is basically associated with the institution of marriage. Treating adultery an offence 
would tanta mount to the State entering into a real private realm. Adultery does not fit into the 
concept of a crime. It is better to be left as a ground for divorce,  Joseph  Shine  v. Union  of India , 
2018.  
 
Adultery  continues  to be a ground  for divorce  
There can be no  shadow of doubt that adultery can be a ground for any kind of civil wrong 
including dissolution of marriage,  Joseph  Shine  v. Union  of India , 2018.  
 
 
 
The judgment has put forward a good initiative as it struck down Sec 497 IPC and Sec 198(2) of 
CrPC as b oth the sections are based on discriminative classification against women. The 
provision is being discriminative in two ways, firstly it does not give woman the right to 
prosecute an adulterous husband and secondly it does not punish a woman in adultery no t even 
as an ‘abettor’.  
Moreover this judgment has also put into practice the idea of transformative justice.  However 
the judgment has lead to some kind of anomaly in the realm of adultery law as it makes the 
practice of adultery non punishable. It is cri ticized that the judgment takes away remedies 
available to any spouse when his or her partner indulges in adultery. And the judgment is also 
silent as to its effect on the social institutions like marriage and also with regard to children born 
out of such relationship or involved in any other manner in similar situations.
