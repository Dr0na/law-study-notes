 CULPABLE HOMICIDE AND MURDER  (SEC. 299 & 300)  
 
The word homicide  has been derived from the Latin word ‘homo’ which means a man 
and ‘caedere’ which means to cut or kill. Thus, homicide means the killing of a human being. All 
cases of homicide are not culpable (punishable). Law distinguishes between lawful and unlawful 
homicide. For instances, killing in self -defense in pursuance of a lawful authority or by reason of 
mistake of fact is not culpable. Likewise, if death is caused by accident or misfortune or while 
doing an act in good faith and without any criminal intentio n for the benefit of the person killed, 
the man is excused from criminal responsibility for homicide. Culpable Homicide is defined 
under section 299 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. It consist s of both physical and mental 
elements. Where an act is done with  the intention of causing death or with such knowledge that 
the act which he/she is going to undertake will result in death of the person or would cause such 
bodily or physical injury that would lead to his death would satisfy both the physical and mental 
requirement.   
 
Illustrations:  
1. Y is diagnosed with terminal illness and needs certain drugs to live from day to day. A 
confines him in a room and denies him his medication. As a result, Y dies. A is guilty of culpable 
homicide.  
2. G mows over a pedestri an deliberately. The pedestrian bleeds on the road and no one helps 
him and he dies as a result of G’s actions. G cannot take the defence that if the pedestrian had 
taken medical treatment at the right time, he would have lived.  
3. M knows S to be behind a  bush. H does not know it. M, intending to cause, or knowing it to be 
likely to cause S’s death, induces H to fire at the bush. H fires and kills S. Here, H may be guilty 
of no offence but M has committed the offence of culpable homicide.  
4. X lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death, or with the 
knowledge that death is likely to be thereby caused. A believing the ground to be firm, trends on 
it falls in and is killed. H has committed the offences of culpable homicide.  
 
 
  
Ingredients of Culpable Homicide  
 
Acts:  
The act should be of such a nature that it would put to peril someone’s life or damage 
someone’s life to such an extent that the person would die. In most cases the act would involve a 
high degree of violence again st the person. For instance, stabbing a person in vital organs, 
shooting someone at point blank range, or administering poison include instances which would 
constitute culpable homicide. The section says causing death by doing an act, so given the 
special circumstances certain acts which may not involve extreme degree of violence but may be 
sufficient to cause someone’s death. For example: starving someone may not require violence in 
the normal usage of the term, but may cause a person’s death.  
Intention:  
The act committed with the Intention of causing death. Thus where you push someone for 
a joke and the person falls on his head has a brain injury and dies, there was no intention of 
causing death but when you pushed the person deliberately with the idea tha t the person falls and 
dies, in that case the act is with the intention of causing death.  
To prove intention in acts where there is bodily injury is likely to cause death. The act has 
to be can be of two types : 
 Firstly, where bodily injury itself is done i n a fashion which cause death. For example 
bludgeoning someone on the head repeatedly with a blunt instrument.  
 Secondly, in situation where there are injuries and there are investigating events between 
the injuries and the death provided the delay is not s o blatant, one needs to prove that 
injuries were administered with the intention of causing death.  
Knowledge : 
Knowledge is different from intention to the extent that where a person may not have the 
intention to commit an act which kills, he knows that the  act which he commits will take 
someone’s life or is likely to take someone’s life will be considered having the knowledge that 
he is likely by such act to cause death.  
 
 Illustrations : 
A doctor uses an infected syringe knowingly on a patient thereby infecting him with a terminal 
disease. The act by itself will not cause death, but the doctor has knowledge that his actions will 
lead to someone’s death.  
 
Culpable Homicide amounting to Murder:  
Section 300 deals with Culpable Homicide amounting to murder.  In others words the 
section states that culpable homicide is murder in certain situations. This makes us come to two 
conclusions namely,  
1. For an act to be classified as murder it must first meet all the conditions of culpable homicide.  
2. All acts of mu rder are culpable homicide, but all acts of culpable homicides are not murder.  
Illustration:  Akash shoots Priya with the intention of killing him. Priya dies in consequences. 
Akash commits Murder.  
 
Culpable homicide is murder in four situations:  
 When an act is done with the intention of causing death:  
The degree of intention required is very high for murder. There must be intention present and the 
intention must be to cause the death of the person, not only harm or grievous hurt without the 
intention to c ause death. Instances would include: - 
• Shooting someone at point blank range  
• Stabbing someone in the hurt  
• Hanging someone by the neck till he dies  
• Strapping a bomb on someone  
• Administering poison to someone  
 Inflicting of bodily injury which the of fender knows is likely to cause death:  
The second situation covers instances where the offender has special knowledge about the 
victim’s condition and causes harm in such a manner which causes death of the person. It states 
that the offender knows likely t o be the cause of death.  
 Bodily injury which causes death in the ordinary course of nature:  
These situations cover such acts where there is bodily injury which in ordinary sequence of 
 events leads to the death of the person. The section actually has two co nditions:  
1. The bodily injury inflicted is inflicted with the intention of causing death of the person on 
whom it is inflicted  
2.The bodily injury caused in the ordinary course of events leads to death of someone.  
 
 Commission of an imminently dangerous ac t without any legitimate reason which would 
cause death or bodily injury which would cause death  
This head covers the commission of those acts which are so imminently dangerous which when 
committed would cause death or bodily injury which would result in d eath of a person and that 
such an act is done without any lawful excuse.  
1. Commission of an inherently dangerous act  
2. The knowledge that the act in all probability will cause death or bodily injury which will cause 
death and  
3. The act is done without a ny excuse  
 
Culpable Homicide not amounting to Murder:  
As stated above an act must first become culpable homicide before it becomes murder.  
 Acts under grave and sudden provocation:  
When a person losses self -control on account of certain situation and causes  the death of some 
person. The provocation must be grave, it must be sudden that is there must be no scope for pre 
meditation and thirdly, it must not be self -invited so as to use it as an excuse to deprive a person 
of his/ her life.  
Illustration : A retur ns from the office and sees his wife, B, in a compromising position with Z in 
his bedroom. A turn out of the room and kills Z next day. It is case of Murder and not Culpable 
because A had sufficient time to cool down his anger.  
 When private Defense is exce eded in good faith  
In exercising private defense either with respect to property or person, if person accidently 
exceeds his or her right in good faith or in wrong judgment and the act causes the death of a 
person, the act is culpable homicide and not murd er.  
Illustration : Z attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause a grievous hurt to A. A 
 draw out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other 
means prevent himself from being horsewhipped shoots Z d ead. A has not committed Murder, 
but only Culpable homicide.  
 Exceeding the Ambit of discharging public duties  
When an officer or public servant exceeds his or her mandate of duties or authority given to him 
or an officer or public servant assisting him exc eeds the same, it is considered culpable homicide 
not amounting to murder.  
 When death is caused in sudden fight or heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel  
Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight, in 
the heat  of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender’s having taken undue 
advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.  
 When death is caused of a person above eighteen years of age who voluntarily took the 
risk of death.  
When death is caused in a situation where a person has by his own consent put himself to risk the 
same would be culpable homicide and not murder.  
Illustration : A, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years of age of 
commit suicide. Here, on account of Z’s youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own 
death; A has therefore abetted murder.  
 
Difference between Culpable Homicide and Murder  
The true difference between culpable homicide and murder is only the difference in degrees of 
intention and knowled ge. A greater the degree of intention and knowledge, the case would fall 
under murder. A lesser degree of intention or knowledge, the case would fall under culpable 
homicide.  However, it is difficult to arrive at any categorical demarcations or strait jack et 
difference between culpable homicide and murder.  
 
 Requirement of Intention : 
Culpable Homicide requires that the offender should have the intention of causing such bodily 
injury as is likely to result in death. This means that so long as the person infli cting the injuries is 
 doing so intentionally she/he has the requisite mental element. it is a question for the court to 
decide if the injuries inflicted on the victim were such that they were likely to result in death. 
The section does not specify a requir ement that the person should that these injuries are such 
they will result in the death of the person on whom they are inflicted.  
Culpable Homicide is murder if a person intentionally causes some bodily injury to a person, and 
the bodily injury such that i t is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.  
 
 Requirement of knowledge  
Culpable Homicide requires that the offender have the knowledge that the act committed by her/ 
him is such that it is likely to result in death. On the other hand, M urder requires that the person 
committing the act have the knowledge that the act committed is so imminently dangerous that it 
must in all probability cause death.  
The position of law related to Culpable Homicide and murder and punishment for the 
same in o ther countries like USA, Canada, Australia, China, Australian, Singapore, and South 
Africa.  
In Kesar Singh v. State of Haryana  the Court held that the distinction between knowledge 
and intention. Knowledge in the context of Section 299 would, inter alia, m ean consciousness or 
realisation or understanding. The distinction between the terms “knowledge” and “intention” 
again is a difference of degrees. An inference of knowledge that it is likely to cause death must 
be arrived at keeping in view the fact situat ion obtaining in each case. The accused must be 
aware of the consequences of his act.  
Knowledge denotes a bare state of conscious awareness of certain facts in which the 
human mind might itself remain supine or inactive whereas intention connotes a conscio us state 
in which mental faculties are roused into activity and summed up into action for the deliberate 
purpose of being directed towards a particular and specific end which the human mind conceives 
and perceives before itself.  
In Rampal  Singh v. State of U.P  the Court held that Sections 299 and 300 of the Code deal with 
the definition of “culpable homicide” and “murder”, respectively. In terms of Section 299, 
“culpable homicide” is described as an act of causing death: (i) with the inten tion of causing 
death, or (ii) with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or (iii) 
 with the knowledge that such an act is likely to cause death.  
As is clear from a reading of this provision, the former part of it, emphasi zes on the 
expression “intention” while the latter upon “knowledge”. Both these are positive mental 
attitudes, however, of different degrees. The mental element in “culpable homicide”, that is, the 
mental attitude towards the consequences of conduct is one  of intention and knowledge. Once an 
offence is caused in any of the three stated manners noted above, it would be “culpable 
homicide”. Section 300, however, deals with “murder” although there is no clear definition of 
“murder” in Section 300 of the Code. As has been repeatedly held by this Court, “culpable 
homicide” is the genus and “murder” is its species and all “murders” are “culpable homicides” 
but all “culpable homicides” are not “murders”.  
 
The difference between both these concepts  can be broadly s pecified as follows:  
1. The aspect of degree of probability of death or it can be said as the seriousness of act of the 
crime. If the act done by the offender is either a heinous crime or it be a very dangerous act that 
causes only death to a person, witho ut any other result it would aptly fall under the concept if 
Murder and not Culpable homicide.  
2. If such an act by the offender leaves the victim to be alive with some grievous hurt with 
chance of escaping death, then it is said to be a Culpable homicide which does not amount to 
murder  
3. Every murder is committed after committing a culpable homicide but every culpable homicide 
does not amount to Murder. Murder is said to be an aggravated form of a Culpable homicide.  
4. The existence of one of the ingredie nt of Section 300 of IPC turns the crime into a murder 
where the exceptions to murder turns the crime into a Culpable homicide which does not amount 
to Murder.  
5. In both the concepts there is intention which is mens rea involved, to kill a person. But 
whereas in Certain case the offender will not be certain in death of the victim, in that case the 
offence done by the offender is a culpable homicide but when the offender has certainty in his 
act will surely cause death of the victim and this will fit into t he definition of murder. Because 
the degree of probability of death is high in murder whereas in Culpable homicide the degree of 
death is low.  
 
 Causing Death by Negligence  
 
S. 304A - “Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act 
notamounting to culpable homicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of either 
description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.”  
 
Sectio n 304 -A was added to the IPC by the Amendment Act, of 1870. This supplies an omission 
providing for the offence of manslaughter by negligence which was originally included in Draft 
Code, but omitted from the Code when it was finally enacted in 1860. To imp ose criminal 
liability under Section 304 -A, it is necessary that the death should have been the direct result of a 
rash and negligent act of the accused and that the act must be the proximate and efficient cause 
without the intervention of another’s neglig ence. It must be the causacausans (immediate or 
operating cause); it is not enough that it may have been the causa sine qua non (a necessary or 
inevitable cause). That is to say, there must be a direct nexus between the death of a person and 
rash or neglig ent act of the accused.  
The provisions of Section 304 -A apply to cases where there is no intention to cause 
death, and no knowledge that the act done in all probability would cause death. Section 304 -A 
deals with homicide by negligence. It does not apply t o a case in which there has been the 
voluntary commission of an offence against the person. The doing of a rash or negligent act, 
which causes death, is the essence of Section 304 -A. There is distinction between a rash act and 
a negligent act. ‘Rashness’ m eans an act done with the consciousness of a risk that evil 
consequences will follow. (It is an act done with the knowledge that evil consequence will follow 
but with the hope that it will not).  
A rash act implies an act done by a person with recklessness or indifference as to its 
consequences. The term ‘negligence’ means ‘breach of a legal duty to take care, which results in 
injury/damage undesired by the wrong doer. The term ‘negligence’ as used in Section 304 -A 
does not mean mere carelessness.  
A negligen t act refers to an act done by a person without taking sufficient precaution or 
reasonable precautions to avoid its probable mischievous or illegal consequences. It implies an 
omission to do something, which a reasonable man, in the given circumstances, wo uld not do. 
Rashness is a higher degree of negligence.  
 The rashness or negligence must be of such nature so as to be termed as a criminal act of 
negligence or rashness. Criminal rashness is hazarding a dangerous or wanton act with the 
knowledge that it is so, and that it may cause injury, but without intention to cause injury, or 
knowledge that it will probably be caused.  
The criminality lies in running the risk of doing such an act with recklessness or 
indifference as to the consequences. Criminal negligen ce is the gross and culpable neglect or 
failure to exercise that reasonable and proper care and precaution to guard against injury either to 
the public generally or to an individual in particular, which, having regard to all the 
circumstances out of which the charge has arisen, t was the imperative duty of the accused 
person to have adopted.  
Culpable rashness is acting with the consciousness that the mischievous and illegal 
consequences may follow, but with the hope that they will not, and often with the be lief that the 
actor has taken sufficient precaution to prevent their happening.  
The imputability arises from acting despite the consciousness. Culpable negligence is 
acting without the consciousness that the illegal and mischievous effect will follow, but in 
circumstances which show that the actor has not exercised the caution incumbent upon him, and 
that, if he had, he would have had the consciousness. The imputability arises from the neglect of 
the civic duty of circumstances. A rash act primarily is an o verhasty act. Negligence is a breach 
of a duty caused by omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided by the those 
considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs would do.  
The expression ‘not amounting to culpable homicide ’ in Section 304 -A indicates the 
offences outside the range of Sections 299 and 300, and obviously contemplates those cases into 
which neither intention nor knowledge enters. It indicates that intentionally on knowingly 
inflicted violence, directly and wil lfully caused, is excluded from the implication of Section 304 -
A. 
Section 304 -A specifically deals with the rash or negligent acts which cause death but fall short 
of culpable homicide of either description. Where A takes up a gun not knowing it is loaded,  
points in sport at В and pulls the trigger, В is shot dead. A would be liable for causing the death 
negligently under Section 304 -A. 
Contributory negligence is no defence to a criminal charge i.e., where the death of a 
person is caused partly by the negli gence of the accused and partly by his own negligence. If the 
 accused is charged with contributing to the death of the deceased by his negligence it matters not 
whether the deceased was deaf, or drunk, or negligent, or in part contributed to his own death.  In 
order to impose criminal liability under Section 304 -A, it is essential to establish that death is the 
direct result of the rash or negligent act of the accused.  
Generally, Section 304 -A is taken into consideration in the cases of road accidents, 
accid ents in factories, etc. It is the duty of the driver to drive the vehicle in a cautious way. 
Where a driver drives the vehicle in an abnormal manner and cause the death of persons, he is 
liable under Section 304 -A. Where a factory owner neglects the mainte nance of the machine, and 
causes the death of a person, he shall be held liable under Section 304 -A. 
However, Section 80 of the IPC provides, “nothing is an offence which is done by 
accident or misfortune and without any criminal knowledge or intention in the doing of a lawful 
act in a lawful manner by a lawful means and with proper care and caution’. It is absence of such 
proper care and caution, which is required of a reasonable man in doing an act, which is made 
punishable under Section 304 -A. 
To render a person liable for neglect of duty it must be such a degree of culpability as to 
amount to gross negligence on his part. It is not every little slip or mistake that will make a man 
so liable. In Shivder Singh v. State a passenger was standing on the foot -board of a bus to the 
knowledge  of the driver and even so the driver negotiated a sharp turn without slowing down. 
The passenger fell off to his death. The driver was held to be guilty under Section 304 -A. 
In Akbar AH v. R , the accused, a motor driver, ran  over and killed a woman, but there 
was no rashness or negligence on the part of the driver so far as his use of the road or manner of 
driving was concerned, it was held that the accused could not be convicted under Section 304 -A 
on the ground that the bra kes of the lorry were not in perfect order and that the lorry carried no 
horn.  
The ‘rash or negligent act’ referred to in Section 304 -A means the act which is the immediate 
cause of death and not any act or omission which can at most be said to be a remote  cause of 
death.  
In Tapti Prasad v. Emperor the accused was the Assistant Station Master on duty. There 
was a collision of passenger train and goods train caused by the signalling of the accused. The 
collision  claimed many lives and the accused were convic ted under Section 304 -A and Section 
101 of Railway Act.  
 In Ramava v. R , the accused administered to her husband a deadly poison (arsenious 
oxide) believing it to be a love potion in order to stimulate his affection for her but the husband 
died. She was con victed under Section 304 -A considering the act of the accused was rash and 
negligent.  
In Batdevji v. State of Gujarat , the accused had run over the deceased while the deceased 
was trying to cross over the road. The accused did not attempt to save the decea sed by swerving 
to the other side, when there was sufficient space. This was a result of his rash and negligent 
driving. His conviction under Section 304 -A was upheld.  
In medical field, a doctor is not criminally liable for a patient’s death, unless his ne gligence or 
incompetence passes beyond a mere matter of competence and shows such a disregard for life 
and safety, as to amount to a crime against the State.  
In Juggan Khan v. State of Madhya Pradesh ,  the accused was a registered homeopath 
who had adminis tered to a patient suffering from guinea worm, 24 drops of stramonium and a 
leaf of dathura without properly studying its effect. The patient died as a result of the medicine 
given the accused. The accused was convicted under Section 304 -A as he has given poisonous 
medicine without being aware of its effects by his rash and negligent act.  
In Jacob Mathew v. State of Punjab, the Supreme Court formulated the following guidelines, 
which should govern the prosecution of doctors for offences of criminal rashness  or criminal 
negligence:  
i) Negligence becomes actionable on accident of injury resulting from the act or omission 
amounting to negligence attributable to that person sued.  
ii) A case of occupational negligence is different from one of professional negligence. A  simple 
lack of care, an error of judgment or an accident, is not proof of negligence on part of a medical 
professional. So long as a doctor follows a practice acceptable to the medical profession of that 
day, he cannot be held liable for negligence merely  because a better alternative course or 
method of treatment is also available or simply because a more skilled doctor would not have 
chosen to follow or resort to that practice or procedure which the accused followed;  
iii) When the charge of negligence arises o ut of failure to use some particular equivalent, the 
charge would fail it the equipment were not generally available at the time (that is at the time of 
the incident) at which it is suggested it should have been used;  
iv) A professional may be held liable for negligence on one of the two findings, viz., either he was 
 not possessed of the requisite skill which he professes to have possessed, or he did not exercise, 
with reasonable competence in the given case, which he did possess;  
v) The standard to be applied for  judging, whether the person charged had been negligent or not, 
would be that of an ordinary competent person exercising ordinary skill in that profession. It is 
not possible for every professional to possess the highest level of expertise or skills in tha t 
branch which he practices;  
vi) The jurisprudential concept of negligence differs in civil and criminal law. What may be 
negligence in civil law may not necessarily be negligence in criminal law. For negligence to 
amount to an offence, the element of mensrea must be shown to exist. The degree of negligence 
must be much higher, i.e., gross on of a very high degree in criminal negligence. Negligence, 
which is neither, gross nor of a very high degree may provide a ground for action in civil law 
but cannot be the basis for prosecutio n 
vii) To prosecute a medical professional for negligence under criminal law it must be shown that 
the accused did something or failed to do something which in the given facts and circumstances 
no medical professional in his ordinary senses and prudence would have done or failed to do. 
The hazard taken by the accused doctor should be of such a nature that the injury that resulted 
was most imminent;  
viii) A private complaint may not be entertained against a doctor unless the complainant has 
produced  prima facie evidence before the court in the form of a credible opinion given by 
another competent doctor to support the charge of rashness or negligence on the part of the 
accused doctor;  
ix) A doctor accused of rashness or negligence may not be arrested in a routine manner (simply 
because a charge has been levelled against him), unless the arrest is necessary for furthering the 
investigation or for collecting evidence;  
x) Simply because a patient has not favourably responded to a treatment given by a physician or a 
surgery has failed, the doctor cannot be held liable per se by applying the doctrine of res ipsa 
loquitur (i.e., the thing speaks for itself).  
The punishment for causing death by negligence under Section 304 -A is imprisonment of 
either description for  a term, which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both. Sentence 
depends on the degree of carelessness seen in the conduct of the accused.  
This offence is cognizable and warrant should ordinarily issue in the first instance. It is bailable, 
 but not compoundable, and is triable by a Magistrate of the First Class.  
 
Dowry Death  
 
The problem of Dowry has always been persistent in India and is also rising at a rapid rate and so 
are the offences related to dowry demand. Dowry demands can go on for years together. The 
birth of children and a number of customary and religious ceremonies often tend to become the 
occasions for dowry demands. The inability of the bride’s family to comply with these demands 
often leads to the daughter -in-law being treated  as a pariah and subject to abuse. In the worst 
cases, wives are simply killed to make way for a new financial transaction —that is, another 
marriage. The Section 304 -B, IPC has been inserted by the Dowry Prohibition Amendment Act, 
1986 with a view of comba ting increased menace of dowry deaths.  
 
304B.  - Where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise 
than under normal circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that soon 
before her death she was sub jected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her 
husband for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall be called” dowry 
death”, and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death.  
To invoke Secti on 304B of the Indian Penal Code the following ingredients are essential:  
 
 The death of a woman should be caused by burns or bodily injury or otherwise than 
under normal circumstances.  
 Such a death should have occurred within seven years of her marriage.  
 She must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of 
her husband.  
 Such cruelty or harassment should be for or in connection with the demand of dowry.  
 Such cruelty or harassment is shown to have been meted out to the woman  soon before 
her  death.  
 
One of the important ingredients to attract the provision of dowry death is that the death of the 
 bride must relate to the cruelty or harassment on account of demand for dowry. It is true that 
Section 304 -B does not define cruelty . However, under explanation of Section 113 -B of the 
Evidence Act, by which presumption of dowry can be drawn, it has been provided that ‘cruelty’ 
shall have the same meaning as in section 498 -A of the Indian Penal Code. As per requirement of 
clause (b) ap pended to section 498 -A I.P.C. there should be a nexus between harassment and any 
unlawful demand for dowry.  
If these conditions are fulfilled then a presumption acts under the Indian Evidence Act 
and the burden of proof shifts on the accused to prove that  he is innocent. The section states:  
In dowry death cases direct evidence may not be available. Such cases may be proved by 
circumstantial evidence. Section 304 -B IPC read with 113 -B of the Evidence Act indicates the 
rule of presumption of dowry death. If an unnatural death of a married woman occurs within 7 
years of marriage in suspicious circumstances, like due to burns or any other bodily injury and 
there is cruelty or harassment by her husband or relatives for or in connection with any demand 
for dowry soon before her death then it shall be dowry death.  
 
113B . of Indian Evidence Act -  Presumption as to Dowry Death  
When the question is whether a person has committed the dowry death of a women and it is 
shown that soon before her death such woman had been subjected by such person to cruelty or 
harassment for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry; the court shall presume that such 
person had caused the dowry death.  
In the case of State of Punjab v. Iqbal Singh, the Supreme Court clarified the position  as 
to why the necessity to introduce Section 113 -B in the Indian Evidence Act was felt – 
The legislative intent is clear to curb the menace of dowry deaths, etc. with a firm hand. It must 
be remembered that since crimes are generally committed in privacy of residential houses and in 
secrecy, independent and direct evidence is not easy to get. That is why the legislature has by 
introducing Section 113 -B in the Evidence Act tried to strengthen the prosecution hands by 
permitting a presumption to be raised if  certain foundation facts are established and the 
unfortunate event has taken place within seven years of marriage. This period of seven years is 
considered to be the turbulent one after which the legislature assumes that the couple would have 
settled down  in life. When the question at issue is whether a person is guilty of dowry death of a 
woman and the evidence discloses that immediately before her death she was subjected by such 
 person to cruelty and/or harassment for, or in connection with, any demand f or dowry. Section 
113-B, Evidence Act provides that the court shall presume that such person had caused the 
dowry death.  
A conjoint reading of Section 113 -B of the Act and 304 -B I.P.C. shows that there must be 
material to show that soon before her death th e victim was subjected to cruelty or harassment. 
Prosecution has to rule out the possibility of a natural or accidental death so as to bring it within 
the purview of the ‘death occurring otherwise than in normal circumstances’. ‘Soon before’ is a 
relative term and it would depend upon circumstances of each case and no straitjacket formula 
can be laid down as to what would constitute a period soon before the occurrence. There must be 
existence of a proximate and live link between the effect of cruelty based on dowry demand and 
the concerned death.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Attempt and abetment to suicide  
 
Suicide has not been defined anywhere in the IPC. However briefly defined, ‘suicide’ is the 
human act of self -inflicted, self -intentioned cessation. It has been defined by various sociologists 
and psychologists in different ways. Some of the definitions are ‘suicide is the initiation of an act 
leading to one’s own death’. “It is synonymous with destruction of the self by the self or the 
intentional destruction of one’s self.” Thus, suicide is killing oneself intentionally so as to 
extinguish one’s life and to leave this world. The Oxford Companion to Law, explains it as ‘self 
killing or taking one’s own lif e. 
Suicide as such is no crime under the code. It is only a ttempt to commit suicide that is punishable 
under this section, i.e., code is attracted only when a person is unsuccessful in committing the 
suicide. If the person succeeds, there is no offender who could be brought within the purview of 
law. The section i s based on the principle that the lives of men are not only valuable to them but 
also to the state which protects them  
Attempt to suicide is an offence punishable under section 309 of the Indian Penal Code.  
 
 
Section 309 reads thus:  
 
Attempt to commit suic ide. “Whoever attempts to commit suicide and does any act towards the 
commission of such offence shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may 
extend to one year or with fine, or with both.”  
Article 21 of the Constitution of India enjoins  that no person shall be deprived of his life or 
personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.  
A Division Bench of the Supreme Court in P. Rathinam v. Union of India 11held that the right to 
live of which Article 21 speaks of can be sa id to bring in its trail the right not to live a forced life, 
and therefore, section 309 violates Article 21.  
This decision was, however, subsequently overruled in GianKaur v. State of Punjab 12by a 
Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, holding that Article 21 cannot be construed to include 
within it the ‘right to die’ as a part of the fundamental right guaranteed therein, and therefore, it 
cannot be said that section 309 is violative of Article 21.  
  Right to live : Ambit and scope – It is settled law that life does not mean ‘animal 
existence’. Before more than 100 years, it was recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court in 
the leading case of Munn v. Illinois. This principle is recognized by our Supreme Court 
in Kharak S ingh, Sunil Batra v. Delhi Administration and in various other cases. After 
Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, various rights have been held to be covered by 
Article 21; such as right to go abroad, right to privacy, right against solitary 
confinement, right to speedy trial, right to shelter, right to breathe in unpolluted 
environment, right to medical aid, right to education, etc. Thus, life does not mean mere 
living, but a glowing vitality – the feeling of wholeness with a capacity for continuous 
intellectua l and spiritual growth.  
 Right to die - As a normal rule, every human being has to live and continue to enjoy the 
fruits of life till nature intervenes to end it.  
 Death is certain . It is a fact of life. Suicide is not a feature of normal life. It is an 
abnor mal situation. But if a person has right to enjoy his life, he cannot also be forced to 
live that life to his detriment, disadvantage or disliking. If a person is living a miserable 
life or is seriously sick or having incurable disease, it is improper as w ell as immoral to 
ask him to live a painful life and to suffer agony. It is an insult to humanity. Right to 
live means right to live peacefully as ordinary human being. One can appreciate the 
theory that an individual may not be permitted to die with a vie w to avoiding his social 
obligations. He should perform all duties towards fellow citizens. At the same time, 
however, if he is unable to take normal care of his body or has lost all the senses and if 
his real desire is to quit the world, he cannot be comp elled to continue with torture and 
painful life. In such cases, it will indeed be cruel not to permit him to die. …  
 Reduction of suffering - Right to live would, however, mean right to live with human 
dignity up to the end of natural life. Thus, right to l ive would include right to die with 
dignity at the end of life and it should not be equated with right to die an unnatural death 
curtailing natural span of life.  
Hence, a dying man who is terminally ill or in a persistent vegetative state can be permitted to 
terminate it by premature extinction of his life. In fact, these are not cases of extinguishing life 
but only of accelerating process of natural death which has already commenced. In such cases, 
causing of death would result in end of his suffering.  
 But even such change, though desirable, is considered to be the function of the legislature which 
may enact a suitable law providing adequate safeguards to prevent any possible abuse.”  
 
Abetment to suicide  
 
Abetment of suicide is an offence under section 306 & 107 of the Indian penal code, 1860. A 
woman may be driven to commit suicide due to excessive demands for dowry. However, it may 
be difficult to prove that the death was a dowry death. In such cases, these provisions can be used 
to punish the offender.  
A person is guilty of abetment when a. He instigates someone to commit suicide (or) b. 
He is part of a conspiracy to make a person commit suicide.(or) c. He intentionally helps the 
victim to commit suicide by doing an act or by not doing something that he wa s bound to do. The 
charge of abetment of suicide is usually accompanied by a charge under section 498A, IPC if the  
woman was treated cruelly by her husband or his relatives. Where a woman has committed 
suicide within 7 years of her marriage because of vio lence by her husband or relatives and the 
prosecution proves the above, the court presumes that the husband or his relatives abetted the 
suicide. Where the woman committed suicide after 7 years of her marriage, no presumption will 
be made. The prosecution has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the cruelty was of such a 
nature that it drove the woman to commit suicide.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hurt and Grievous Hurt  
 
In normal sense, hurt means to cause bodily injury and/or pain to another person. IPC defines 
Hurt as follows - 
Section 319 - Whoever causes bodily pain, disease, or infirmity to any person is said to cause 
hurt. 
Based on this, the essential ingredients of Hurt are - 
 
i. Bodily pain, disease or infirmity must be caused - Bodily pain, except such slight harm 
for which nobody would complain, is hurt. For example, pricking a person with pointed 
object like a needle or punching somebody in the face, or pulling a woman's hair. The 
duration of the pain is immaterial. Infirmity means when any body organ is not able t o 
function normally. It can be temporary or permanent. It also includes state of mind such as 
hysteria or terror.  
ii. It should be caused due to a voluntary act of the accused.  
 
The expression ‘bodily pain’ means that the pain must be physical as opposed to an y mental 
pain. So mentally or emotionally hurting somebody will not be ‘hurt’ within the meaning of 
Section 319. However, in order to come within this section, it is not necessary that any visible 
injury should be caused on the victim.  
All that the section  contemplates is the causing of bodily pain. The degree or severity of the pain 
is not a material factor to decide whether Section 319 will apply or not. The duration of pain is 
immaterial. Pulling a woman by the hair would amount to hurt.  
‘Causing disease ’ means communicating a disease to another person. However, the 
communication of the disease must be done by contact.  
Causing of nervous shock or mental derangement by some voluntary act of the offender is 
covered by Section 319. The duration of the state of mental infirmity is immaterial.  
‘Infirmity’ means inability of an organ to perform its normal function which may either be 
temporary or permanent. It denotes an unsound or unhealthy state of the body or mind, such as a 
state of temporary impairment or h ysteria or terror. ‘Infirmity’ denotes an unsound or unhealthy 
state of the body. This infirmity may be a result of a disease or as a result of consumption of 
 some poisonous, deleterious drug or alcohol.  
 
As per Section 319, the hurt must be caused to ‘any  person’. This means ‘any person’ other than 
the person causing the hurt.  
The causing of bodily pain must be caused by direct application of force to the body is clearly 
erroneous as there is nothing in Section 319 to suggest that the hurt should be caused  by direct 
physical contact between the accused and his victim. Where the direct result of an act is the 
causing of bodily pain, it is hurt whatever be the means employed to cause it.  
Where there is no intention to cause death or bodily injury as is likely  to cause death or there is 
no knowledge that death is likely to be caused from the harm inflicted, and death is caused, the 
accused would be guilty of hurt only if the injury caused was not serious.  
In  Marana Goundan v. R the accused demanded money from the deceased which the 
latter owed him. The deceased promised to pay later. Thereafter the accused kicked him on th e 
abdomen and the deceased collapsed and died. The accused was held guilty of causing hurt as it 
could not be said that he intended or knew t hat kicking on the abdomen was likely to endanger 
life. 
In Naga Shevepo v. R [(1883) SJLB 179] the accused struck a man one blow on the head with a 
bamboo yoke and the injured man died afterwards in a hospital. He was guilty of an offence of 
causing hurt u nder Section 319 because there was no intention to cause death and the blow in 
itself was not of such a nature as was likely to cause death  itself was not of such a nature as was  
In Arjuna Sahu  v. State it was observed that a push on the neck is likely to cause some bodily 
pain within the meaning of Section 319 though in some cases it may be so slight.  
Self-inflicted hurt does not come within the purview of Section 319. Section 321 elaborates on  
what amounts to voluntarily causing hurt  
When there is no intention of causing death or bodily injury as is likely to cause death, 
and there is no knowledge that inflicting such injury would cause death, the accused would be 
guilty of hurt if the injury i s not serious. In Nga  Shwe Po's case (1883 ), the accused struck a man 
one blow on the head with a bamboo yoke and the injured man died, primarily due to excessive 
opium administered by his friends to alleviate pain. He was held guilty under this section.  
A physical contact is not necessary. Thus, a when an accused gave food mixed with dhatura and 
caused poisoning, he was held guilty of Hurt.  
 The term ‘Simple hurt’ is used nowhere in the IPC. However, to differentiate ordinary hurt 
covered by Sections 319, 3 21 & 323, from that of grievous hurt, the expression ‘simple hurt’ has 
come into popular use.  
 
Grievous Hurt  
 
Section 320 lays down the following kinds of hurt only which are designated as "grievous":  
 
(1) Emasculation i.e., depriving a person of masculine vigour;  
 
(2) Permanent privation of the sight of either eye;  
 
(3) Permanent privation of hearing of either ear;  
 
(4) Privation of any member of joint  
 
(5) Destruction or permanent impairing of the powers of any member or joint:  
(6) Permanent disfiguration of the  head or face  
 
(7) Fracture or dislocation of bone or tooth; and  
 
(8) Any hurt which endangers life or which causes the sufferer to be during the space of 20 
days in severe bodily pain, or unable to follow his ordinary pursuits —(seven years, and 
fine).  
 
It could n ot be said that the accused intended or knew that the kicking on the abdomen was likely 
to endanger life and consequently the accused was guilty of causing hurt only.  It was held in 
similar circumstances in Shahe Rai (3 Cal. 623) that the accused had commi tted hurt on the 
infant under the circumstances of sufficient aggravation to bring the offence within the definition 
of grievous hurt.  The offence committed is neither of grievous hurt, not of culpable homicide, 
but of simple hur t.  
 Criminal force and assa ult 
 
Section 350 - Whoever intentionally uses force to any person, without that person’s consent, in 
order to the committing of any offence, or intending by the use of such force to cause, or 
knowing it to be likely that by the use of such force he will cause injury, fear or annoyance to 
the person to whom the force is used, is said to use criminal force to that other.  
Illustrations  
 
(a) Z is sitting in a moored boat on a river. A unfastens the moorings, and thus intentionally causes 
the boat to drift down th e stream. Here A intentionally causes motion to Z, and hedoes this by 
disposing substances in such a manner that the motion is produced without any other act on any 
person’s part. A has there -fore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so withou t Z’s 
consent, in order to the committing of any offence, or in -tending or knowing it to be likely that 
this use of force will cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force to Z.  
(b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z’s horses, and thereby causes them to quicken their pace. 
Here Z has caused change of motion to Z by inducing the animals to change their motion. A has 
therefore used force to Z; and if A has done this without Z’s consent, intending or  knowing it 
to be likely that he may thereb y injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z.  
(c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops the palanquin. Here A 
has caused cessation of motion to Z, and he has done this by his own bodily power. A has 
there fore used force to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, without Z’s consent, in order to 
the commission of an offence. A has used criminal force to Z.  
(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power moved his 
own per son so as to bring it into contact with Z. He has therefore intentionally used force to Z; 
and if he has done so without Z’s consent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may 
thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z.  
(e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus brought into 
contact with Z, or with Z’s clothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water 
and dash up the water against Z’s clothes or something carried by  Z. Here, if the throwin g of 
the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with  Z, or Z’s 
clothes. A has used force to Z; and if he did so without Z’s consent, intending thereby to injure, 
 frighten or annoy Z, he has used crimi nal force to Z.  
(f) A intentionally pulls up a woman’s veil. Here A intentionally uses force to her, and if he does 
so without her consent intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten 
or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her . 
(g) Z is bathing, A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here A intentionally by 
his own bodily power causes such motion in the boiling water as brings that water into con -tact 
with Z, or with other water so situated that such contact must  affect Z’s sense of feeling; A has 
therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done this without Z’s consent intending or 
knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury, fear, or annoyance to Z, A has used 
criminal force.  
(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z’s consent. Here, if A intends to cause injury, fear or 
annoyance to Z, he uses criminal force to Z.  
According to Section 350 of the Code, force becomes criminal (i) when it is used without 
consent and in order to the committ ing of an offence; or (ii) when it is intentionally used to cause 
injury, fear or annoyance to another to whom the force is used.  
The ingredients of Section 350 of the Code are:  
 
i) The intentional use of the force to any person;  
 
ii) Such force must have been us ed without the person’s consent;  
 
iii) The force must have been used:  
 
a) In order to the committing of an offence; or  
 
b) With the intention to cause, or knowing it to be likely that it will cause, injury, fear or 
annoyance to the person to whom it is used.  
 
The term ‘battery’ of English law is included in ‘Criminal force’. ‘Battery’ is the actual and 
intentional application of any physical force of an adverse nature to the person of another 
without his consent, or even with his consent, if it is obtained by f raud, or the consent is 
 unlawful, as in the case of a prize -fighting.  
The criminal force may be very slight as not amounting to an offence as per Section 95 of 
the Code. Its definition is very wide so as to include force of almost every description of whic h a 
person may become an ultimate object. Criminal force is the exercise of one’s energy upon 
another human being and it may be exercised directly or indirectly.  So if A raises his stick at В 
and the latter moves away, A uses force within the meaning of Se ction 350. Similarly, if a person 
shouts, cries and calls a dog or any other animal and it moves in consequence, it would amount 
to the use of force. In the use of criminal force no bodily injury or hurt need be caused.  Where A 
spits over B, A would be lia ble for using criminal force against В because spitting must have 
caused annoyance to B. Similarly if A removes the veil of a lady he would be guilty under 
Section 350 of the Code.  The word ‘intentional’ excludes all involuntary, accidental or even 
neglige nt acts. An attendant at a bath, who from pure carelessness turns on the wrong tap and 
causes boiling water to fall on another, could not be convicted for the use of criminal force.  The 
word ‘consent’ should be taken as defined in Section 90, IPC. There is  some difference between 
doing an act ‘without one’s consent’ and ‘against his will’. The latter involves active mental 
opposition to the act.  
According to Mayne, “where it is an element of an offence that the act should have been 
done without the consent of the person affected by it, some evidence must be offered that the act 
was done to him against his will or without his consent”.  
The various illustrations under Section 350 exemplify the different ingredients of the 
definition of force given in Section 3 49. Of these illustrations, illustration (a) exemplifies motion 
in Section 349; illustration (b) ‘change of motion’; illustration (c) ‘cessation of motion; 
illustrations (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) ‘cause to any substance any such motion’. Clause (1)of 
Section 349 is illustrated by illustrations (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g); clause (2) of Section 349 is 
illustrated by illustration (a); and clause (3) of Section 349 is illustrated by illustrations(b) and 
(h). 
 
 
 
 
 
 Assault  
 
Section 350 - Assault. —Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it 
to be likely that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he 
who makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to 
commit an assault. Explanation. —Mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words 
which a person uses may give to his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those 
gestures or preparations amount to an assault.  
Illustration s  
(a) A shakes his fist at Z , intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to 
believe that A is about to strike Z, A has committed an assault.  
(b) A begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending or knowing it to be likely that he 
may thereby cause Z to be lieve that he is about to cause the dog to attack Z. A has committed 
an assault upon Z.  
(c) A takes up a stick, saying to Z, “I will give you a beating”. Here, though the words used by A 
could in no case amount to an assault, and though the mere gesture, unaccompanied by any 
other circumstances, might not amount to an assault, the gesture explained by the words may 
amount to an assault.  
As per Tomlins Law Dictionary, assault is “An attempt with force and violence, to do corporal 
hurt to another as by strik ing at him with or without a weapon. But no words whatsoever, be they 
ever so provoking can amount to an assault, notwithstanding the many ancient opinions to the 
contrary”.  
An assault is (a) an attempt unlawfully to apply any of the least actual force to the person of 
another directly or indirectly; (b) the act of using a gesture towards another, giving him 
reasonable grounds to believe that the person using that gesture meant to apply such actual force 
to his person as aforesaid; (c) the act of depriving another of his liberty, in either case, without 
the consent of the person assaulted, or with such consent if it is obtained by fraud.  
The essential ingredients of an assault are:  
 
1) That the accused should make a gesture or preparation to use criminal force;  
 
 2) Such gesture or preparation should be made in the presence of the person in respect of 
whom it is made;  
3) There should be intention or knowledge on the part of the accused that such gesture or 
preparation would cause apprehension in the mind of the victim that criminal force 
would be used against him;  
4) Such gesture or preparation has actually caused apprehension in the mind of the victim, 
of use of criminal force against him.  
Assault is generally understood to mean the use of criminal force against a person,  causing some 
bodily injury or pain. But, legally, ‘assault’ denotes the preparatory acts which cause 
apprehension of use of criminal force against the person. Assault falls short of actual use of 
criminal force. An assault is then nothing more than a thre at of violence exhibiting an intention 
to use criminal force accompanied with present ability to affect  the purpos e. 
According to Section 351 of the Code, the mere gesture or preparation with the intention 
of knowledge that it is likely to cause apprehensi on in the mind of the victim, amounts to an 
offence of assault. The explanation to Section 351 provides that mere words do not amount to 
assault, unless the words are used in aid of the gesture or preparation which amounts to assault.  
The apprehension of t he use of criminal force must be from the person making the gesture or 
preparation, but if it arises from some other person it would not be assault on the part of that 
person, but from somebody else, it does not amount to assault on the part of that person . The 
following have been held to be instances of assault:  
i) Lifting one’s  lathi  
 
ii) Throwing brick into another’s house  
 
iii) Fetching a sword and advancing with it towards the victim  
 
iv) Pointing of a gun, whether loaded or unloaded, at a person at a short distance  
 
v) Advancing with a threatening attitude to strike blows.  
 
 
 Though mere preparation to commit a crime is not punishable, yet preparation with the intention 
specified in this section amounts to an assault.  
Another essential requirement of assault is that the person threatened should be present and near 
enough to apprehend danger. At the same time there must have been present ability in the 
assailant to give effect to his words or gestures.  
If a person standing in the compartment of a running train, makes threa tening gesture at a 
person standing on the station platform, the gesture will not amount to assault, for the person has 
no present ability to effectuate his purpose.  
The question whether a particular act amounts to an assault or not depends on whether 
the act  has caused reasonable apprehension in the mind of the person that criminal force was 
imminent. The words or the action should not be threat of assault at some future point in time. 
The apprehension of use of criminal force against the person should be  in the present and 
immediate.  
The gist of the offence of assault is the intention or knowledge that the gesture or preparations 
made by the accused would caused such effect upon the mind of another that he would 
apprehend that criminal force was about to be used against him. Illustration (b) to Section 351 
exemplifies that although mere preparation to commit a crime is not punishable yet preparation 
with intention specified in Section 351 amounts to assaul t. 
The offence under Section 351 is non -cognizable,  bailable, compoundable, and triable by any 
Magistrate.  
 
Wrongful Restraint and Wrongful confinement Wrongful Restraint  
 
Section 339. Wrongful restraint  
 
Whoever voluntarily obstructs any person so as to prevent that person from proceeding in any 
direction  in which that person has right to proceed, is said wrongfully to restrain that person.  
Wrongful restraint means preventing a person from going to a place where he has a right to go. 
In wrongful confinement, a person is kept within certain limits out of wh ich he wishes to go and 
has a right to go. In wrongful restraint, a person is prevented from proceeding in some particular 
direction though free to go elsewhere. In wrongful confinement, there is restraint from 
 proceeding in all directions beyond a certain  area. One may even be wrongfully confined in one's 
own country where by a threat issued to a person prevents him from leaving the shores of his 
land.  
Object - The object of this section is to protect the freedom of a person to utilize his right to pass 
in his. The slightest unlawful obstruction is deemed as wrongful restraint. Physical obstruction is 
not necessary always. Even by mere words constitute offence under this section. The main 
ingredient of this section is that when a person obstructs another by  causing it to appear to that 
other that it is impossible difficult or dangerous to proceeds as well as by causing it actually to be 
impossible, difficult or dangerous for that to proceeds.  
Ingredients:  
 
1. An obstruction.  
 
2. Obstruction prevented complainant from proceeding in any direction. Obstruction: - 
 
Obstruction mans physical obstruction, though it may cause by physical force or by the use of 
menaces or threats. When such obstruction is wrongful it becomes the wrongful restraint. For a 
wrongful restraint  it is necessary that one person must obstruct another voluntarily.  
In simple word it means keeping a person out of the place where his wishes to, and has a right to 
be. 
This offence is completed if one's freedom of movement is suspended by an act of anoth er done 
voluntarily.  
Restraint necessarily implies abridgment of the liberty of a person against his wil l.  
What is required under this section is obstruction to free movement of a person, the method used 
for such obstruction is immaterial. Use of physical  force for causing such obstruction is not 
necessary. Normally a verbal prohibition or remonstrance does not amount to obstruction, but in 
certain circumstances it may be caused by threat or by mere words. Effect of such word upon the 
mind of the person ob structed is more important than the method.  
Obstruction of personal liberty:  Personal liberty of a person must be obstructed. A person means 
a human being, here the question arises whether a child of a tender age who cannot walk of his 
own legs could also be the subject of restraint was raised in Mahendra Nath Chakravarty v. 
 Emperor. It was held that the section is not confined to only such person who can walk on his 
own legs or can move by physical means within his own power. It was further said that if on ly 
those who can move by physical means within their own power are to be treated as person who 
wishes to proceed then the position would become absurd in case of paralytic or sick who on 
account of his sickness cannot move.  
Another points that needs our at tention here is whether obstruction to vehicle seated with 
passengers would amount to wrongful restraint or not.  
An interesting judgment of our Bombay High Court in Emperor v. Ramlala : "Where, therefore a 
driver of a bus makes his bus stand across a road in such a manner, as to prevent another bus 
coming from behind to proceed further, he is guilty of an offence under Sec. 341 of the Penal 
Code of wrongfully restraining the driver and passengers of another bus".  
"It is absurd to say that because the driver  and the passengers of the other bus could have got 
down from that bus and walked away in different directions, or even gone in that bus to different 
destinations, in reverse directions, there was therefore no wrongful restraint" is the judgment of 
our Hig h Court which is applicable to our busmen who suddenly park the buses across the roads 
showing their protest on some issues.  
Illustrations - 
 
I. A was on the roof of a house. B removes the ladder and thereby detains A on the roof.  
 
II. A and B were co -ower of a we ll. A prevented B from taking out water from the well .  
 
 
Wrongful confinement  
 
Section 340. Wrongful confinemen t. 
Whoever wrongfully restrains any person in such a manner as to prevent that person from 
proceedings beyond certain circumscribing limits, is said "wrongfully to confine" that person.  
Object - The object of this section is to protect the freedom of a person where his personal liberty 
has totally suspended or abolish, by voluntarily act done by another.  
Wrongful confinement is aggravated form of wrongful restraint. In wrongful restraint, the person 
 restrained is obstructed to proceed in a direction in which he has right to proceed. However 
alternative ways are always opened in wrongful restraint. But in w rongful confinement, the 
person restrained is confined in some circumscribed limits. In wrongful confinement, restrained 
person is not allowed to move anywhere. He has no alternative to move in any other way.  
 
Ingredients:  
 
A. The person must be wrongfully re strained.  
 
B. The restrained person must be such as to prevent the person to proceed beyond some 
circumscribing limits.  
 
The person must be wrongfully restrained: Before satisfying other conditions it is 
necessary that the conditions for a wrongful restrained  must be satisfied. (All the ingredients of
