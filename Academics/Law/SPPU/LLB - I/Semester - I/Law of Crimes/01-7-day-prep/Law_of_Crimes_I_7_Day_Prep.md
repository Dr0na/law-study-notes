# 📅 DAY 1: MODULE I - INTRODUCTION TO BNS 2023

## 🎯 Today's Target
- ✅ Crime: Definition & Elements
- ✅ Actus Reus & Mens Rea
- ✅ Stages of Crime
- ✅ Historical Background
- ✅ Structure of BNS

---

## 📚 TOPIC 1: CRIME - MEANING & ELEMENTS

### What is Crime?

**Crime** = An act/omission punishable by law

**Important Definitions:**
- **Blackstone:** Act committed/omitted in violation of public law
- **Salmond:** Act deemed harmful to society even if victim is individual
- **Kenny:** Harmful conduct that sovereign desires to prevent

---

### Essential Elements: **ACTUS REUS + MENS REA**

#### Maxim: "Actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea"
*An act does not make a person guilty unless the mind is also guilty*

---

### 1️⃣ ACTUS REUS (Guilty Act)

**Components:**
- Voluntary act
- Omission to act (when duty exists)
- State of affairs

**Causation Tests:**
- **Causa causans:** Immediate operating cause ✅
- **Causa sine qua non:** Necessary cause but not sufficient ❌

📌 **Cases:**
- **R v. Hilton:** Intervening act breaks chain of causation
- **R v. Martin:** Victim's voluntary act breaks causation
- **R v. Swindall:** Contributory negligence NO defense in crime

---

### 2️⃣ MENS REA (Guilty Mind)

**Hierarchy (Highest to Lowest):**

```
1. INTENTION
   └─> Foresees + Wills = Highest culpability
   
2. KNOWLEDGE
   └─> Aware but may not desire
   
3. RECKLESSNESS
   └─> Foresees but takes unjustifiable risk
   
4. NEGLIGENCE
   └─> Fails to foresee (breach of duty)
```

🧠 **Memory:** "I-K-R-N"

📌 **Case:** *Basdev v. State of Pepsu* - Knowledge is awareness; intention is willingness

---

### MOTIVE vs. MENS REA

| **Motive**          | **Mens Rea**          |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| WHY act done        | Mental state          |
| Not essential       | Essential             |
| May be good/bad     | Always guilty state   |
| Relevant for punishment | Relevant for liability |

**Example:** Stealing to feed poor = Good motive but guilty mens rea

---

## 📚 TOPIC 2: STAGES OF CRIME

```
INTENTION → PREPARATION → ATTEMPT → COMMISSION
    ❌          ❌ (usually)     ✅          ✅
```

### Analysis

1. **Intention** - Not punishable (*Cogitationis poenam nemo patitur*)
2. **Preparation** - Generally not punishable (exceptions: dacoity, war)
3. **Attempt** - Punishable under Section 511 IPC / 62 BNS
4. **Commission** - Fully punishable

🧠 **Memory:** "I-PAC"

### Preparation vs. Attempt

| **Preparation**      | **Attempt**           |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Arranging means      | Using means           |
| Remote from crime    | Proximate to crime    |
| Equivocal act        | Unequivocal act       |
| Example: Buying gun  | Example: Pulling trigger |

---

- **Held:** Protected under Section 76 if order lawful and acted in good faith

---

### Mistake of Law

3. Relied on judicial decision later overruled
4. Relied on official interpretation

📌 **R v. Bailey:** Ignorance of law no excuse (even if couldn't know)

---

### 📊 Quick Comparison

| **Mistake of Fact**  | **Mistake of Law**    |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
| ✅ Valid defense     | ❌ NO defense         |

# 📅 DAY 3: MODULE II (Part 2) + MODULE III

## 🎯 Today's Target
- ✅ Right of Private Defense
- ✅ Abetment
- ✅ Conspiracy
- ✅ Attempt

---

## 📚 TOPIC 1: RIGHT OF PRIVATE DEFENSE (SECTIONS 96-106 IPC / 34-44 BNS)

### Fundamental Principle

**Section 96:** Nothing is offense done in exercise of right of private defense

**Philosophy:**
- Natural right of self-preservation
- When no time to seek state help
- Preventive, not punitive

---

### Two Types

```
1. PRIVATE DEFENSE OF BODY (Sections 100-101)
   └─> Against assault, rape, kidnapping, etc.

2. PRIVATE DEFENSE OF PROPERTY (Sections 102-105)
   └─> Against theft, robbery, mischief, trespass
```

---

### When Right Arises & Ends

**Commencement:**
- When reasonable apprehension of danger
- Need not wait for actual assault

**Continuation:**
- So long as danger continues

**Termination:**
- When danger ceases
- When attacker escapes/disabled
- Cannot pursue fleeing attacker

🧠 **Key:** Right is PREVENTIVE, not PUNITIVE

---

### When Can DEATH Be Caused?

#### For BODY (Section 100)

🧠 **Memory:** "Death-GH-Rape-Lust-Kidnap-Acid"

```
1. ⚰️ Assault → Reasonable apprehension of DEATH
2. ⚰️ Assault → Reasonable apprehension of GRIEVOUS HURT
3. ⚰️ Assault → Intent to RAPE
4. ⚰️ Assault → Intent to gratify UNNATURAL LUST
5. ⚰️ Assault → Intent to KIDNAP/ABDUCT
6. ⚰️ Assault → Intent to WRONGFULLY CONFINE (if can't seek help)
7. ⚰️ ACID attack → Causing/likely to cause GH
```

#### For PROPERTY (Section 103)

🧠 **Memory:** "RoBN-FIRE-TMT"

```
1. ⚰️ ROBBERY
2. ⚰️ HOUSE-BREAKING by NIGHT

📌 **Darshan Singh v. State of Punjab (SC)**
- **Principle:** No right against public servants acting in good faith

📌 **Munshi Ram v. Delhi Administration**
- **Principle:** Force must be proportionate to injury apprehended

---

### 📊 Analysis Framework

```
STEP 1: Did right exist?
        └─> Offense/apprehension of offense?

STEP 2: Against whom?
        └─> Cannot be innocent/public servant in good faith

STEP 3: When?
        └─> Danger must be continuing

STEP 4: Was force proportionate?
        └─> Not excessive

STEP 5: Did it continue after danger ceased?
        └─> Cannot be retributive
```

---

## 📚 TOPIC 2: ABETMENT (SECTIONS 107-116 IPC / 45-60 BNS)

### Definition (Section 107)

**Three Ways to Abet:**

```
1. INSTIGATION
   └─> Actively suggesting, inciting, encouraging

2. CONSPIRACY
   └─> Agreement between two or more persons

3. INTENTIONAL AID
   └─> Helping by act or illegal omission
```

---

### Essential Ingredients

```

2. ✅ Abettor must do one of three acts:
   ├─> Instigate, OR
   ├─> Conspire, OR
   └─> Intentionally aid
3. ✅ Connection between abetment and offense
```

---

### Types of Abetment

#### 1. Abetment by Instigation

**Instigation** = Active suggestion, support, stimulation

**Methods:**
- Direct incitement
- Goading
- Urging
- Creating atmosphere of encouragement

**Not Instigation:**
- Mere advice
- Casual remark
- Reporting offense to authority

---

#### 2. Abetment by Conspiracy

**Requirements:**
- Two or more persons
- Agreement to do illegal act or legal act by illegal means
- Overt act not necessary for abetment liability

---

#### 3. Abetment by Intentional Aid

**Requirements:**
- Aid must be INTENTIONAL
- Aid must be by ACT or ILLEGAL OMISSION
- Knowledge that act being aided is offense

**Examples:**
- Keeping watch during burglary
- Providing weapons
- Driving getaway vehicle

---

### Abetment of Abetment (Section 111)

**Allowed:** A abets B to abet C to commit offense
- A can be punished as if he abetted C directly

---

### Abettor Present vs. Absent (Sections 109, 113, 114, 115, 116)

```
ABETTOR PRESENT AT SCENE
└─> Section 109: Same punishment as principal

ABETTOR ABSENT
└─> Section 113: Same punishment as principal

DIFFERENT OFFENSE COMMITTED (Section 111)
├─> If consequence of abetment
└─> Abettor liable for that offense too

ABETMENT OF OFFENSE PUNISHABLE WITH DEATH/LIFE
└─> If offense not committed but act done
    └─> Imprisonment up to 7 years + fine
```

---

### Important Principles

**Impossibility No Defense:**
- A abets B to kill C
- C already dead
- A still liable for abetment

**Abettor Liability Even If Principal Not Identified:**
- Can punish abettor even if principal not caught

**Abettor May Be Punished Though Principal Not Punished:**
- If principal has defense (insanity, infancy)
- Abettor still liable

---

└─> As specified in section
```

---

### Conspiracy vs. Abetment

| **Conspiracy**               | **Abetment**                 |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Agreement is offense itself  | Offense must be committed    |

## 📚 TOPIC 4: ATTEMPT (SECTION 511 IPC / 62 BNS)

### Definition

**Attempt** = Direct movement towards commission after preparation

**Section 511:** Attempt to commit offense punishable with imprisonment for life/imprisonment

---

### Essential Ingredients

```
1. ✅ Intention to commit offense
2. ✅ Offense punishable with imprisonment for life/imprisonment
3. ✅ Act done towards commission

5. ✅ No express provision for punishment of attempt
```

---

### Preparation vs. Attempt

| **Preparation**         | **Attempt**              |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Arranging means         | Using means              |
| Remote from crime       | Proximate to crime       |
| Equivocal act           | Unequivocal act          |
| Generally not punishable| Punishable (Section 511) |
| Example: Buying poison  | Example: Administering poison |

---

### Tests to Distinguish

**1. Proximity Test**
- How close to actual commission?
- Immediate step = attempt

**2. Equivocality Test**
- Does act unequivocally show criminal intent?
- If yes = attempt

**3. Substantial Step Test**
- Has accused taken substantial step towards commission?

---

### Impossibility

**Legal vs. Factual Impossibility:**

```
FACTUAL IMPOSSIBILITY: NOT A DEFENSE
├─> A tries to steal from empty pocket
└─> A still liable for attempt

LEGAL IMPOSSIBILITY: MAY BE DEFENSE
├─> Act attempted is not actually criminal
└─> No liability
```

---

### Punishment

**Section 511:**
- Imprisonment: Up to 1/2 of longest term provided for offense
- OR Fine provided for offense
- OR Both

**Example:**
- Murder punishable with death/life → Attempt to murder: Life or less

---

## 🎯 Today's Target
- ✅ Culpable Homicide & Murder
- ✅ Distinction between CH and Murder
- ✅ Death by Negligence
- ✅ Hurt & Grievous Hurt

---

## 📚 TOPIC 1: CULPABLE HOMICIDE (SECTION 299 IPC / 100 BNS)

### Definition

**Culpable Homicide:** Causing death:
1. With intention of causing death, OR
2. With intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, OR
3. With knowledge that likely to cause death

---

### Three Clauses Explained

```
CLAUSE 1: Intention to cause DEATH
└─> Example: A shoots B in heart intending to kill

CLAUSE 2: Intention to cause BODILY INJURY likely to cause death
└─> Example: A stabs B in vital organ knowing it may cause death

CLAUSE 3: Knowledge that act likely to cause DEATH
└─> Example: A pushes B from height knowing fall likely fatal
```

---

### Essential Ingredients

```
1. ✅ ACT or OMISSION by accused
2. ✅ Act CAUSED DEATH
3. ✅ Causation between act and death
4. ✅ Intention or knowledge as specified
```

---

## 📚 TOPIC 2: MURDER (SECTION 300 IPC / 101 BNS)

### Relationship

**All murders are culpable homicide, but all culpable homicides are not murder**

Murder is aggravated form of culpable homicide.

---

### When is Culpable Homicide MURDER?

**Four Situations:**

```
1. Intention to cause DEATH
   └─> Example: A shoots B in head to kill

2. Intention to cause such bodily injury as offender knows is LIKELY TO CAUSE DEATH
   └─> Example: A knows B has weak heart; frightens him severely

3. Intention to cause bodily injury SUFFICIENT in ordinary course of nature to cause death
   └─> Example: A stabs B in heart (such injury ordinarily causes death)

4. Knowledge that act so IMMINENTLY DANGEROUS that in all probability will cause death
   └─> Example: A fires into crowd knowing likely to kill someone
```

---

### 📊 Culpable Homicide vs. Murder

**Key Difference:** Degree of intention/knowledge

| **Culpable Homicide**            | **Murder**                      |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Intention to cause injury likely to cause death | Intention to cause injury sufficient to cause death |
| Knowledge act likely to cause death | Knowledge act in all probability will cause death |
| PROBABILITY | CERTAINTY/HIGH PROBABILITY |
| Lesser degree | Greater degree |

🧠 **Remember:** Difference is only in DEGREE

---

### Leading Cases

📌 **Virsa Singh v. State of Punjab (SC)**
- **Four-step test:**
  1. Was there intention to cause bodily injury?
  2. What bodily injury was intended?
  3. Was injury sufficient in ordinary course to cause death?
  4. Was injury intended of the type specified?

📌 **Kesar Singh v. State of Haryana (SC)**
- **Principle:** Distinction between intention and knowledge is difference of degrees

📌 **Rampal Singh v. State of U.P. (SC)**
- **Principle:** Mental attitude distinguishes CH from murder

---

### Illustrations

**Example 1:**
A strikes B once on head with stick → B dies
- **Analysis:** Single blow, not on vital spot → Likely CH not murder

**Example 2:**
A stabs B multiple times in chest with knife → B dies
- **Analysis:** Multiple stabs in vital organ → Murder

**Example 3:**
A pushes B in sudden fight → B hits head on wall, dies
- **Analysis:** Single push, no intention of severe injury → CH not murder

---

## 📚 TOPIC 3: EXCEPTIONS TO MURDER (SECTION 300 IPC)

### Five Exceptions (Murder → Culpable Homicide)

```
EXCEPTION 1: GRAVE & SUDDEN PROVOCATION
└─> Loss of self-control due to sudden provocation

```

---

### Criminal Negligence
