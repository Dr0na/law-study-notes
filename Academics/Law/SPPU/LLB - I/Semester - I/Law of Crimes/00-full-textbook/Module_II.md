## 🎯 INTRODUCTION TO GENERAL EXCEPTIONS

General Exceptions = Circumstances where an act which would ordinarily be a crime is NOT treated as such.

### Philosophy

```
WHY GENERAL EXCEPTIONS EXIST:
1. ABSENCE OF MENS REA (No guilty mind)
2. JUSTIFIED ACT (For greater good)
3. LACK OF CAPACITY (Cannot form intent)
4. ACT UNDER COMPULSION (No choice)
```

### Classification

**TYPE 1: EXCUSABLE DEFENSES** (No mens rea)
- Mistake of fact
- Accident  
- Infancy
- Insanity
- Involuntary intoxication

**TYPE 2: JUSTIFIABLE DEFENSES** (Act justified)
- Necessity
- Private defense
- Consent
- Judicial acts

> 🧠 **Mnemonic: "MI-ANI-PAN"**
> M-Mistake, I-Infancy, A-Accident, N-Necessity, I-Insanity, P-Private defense, A-Acts of judges, N-Not voluntary

## 🔍 MISTAKE OF FACT AND LAW

### Latin Maxim
**"Ignorantia facti excusat, ignorantia juris non excusat"**
= Ignorance of fact excuses, ignorance of law does not excuse

### Sections 76 & 79 IPC (14 & 17 BNS)

**Section 76:** Act of person bound by law or by mistake believing himself bound
**Section 79:** Act justified or by mistake believing himself justified by law

#### Essential Ingredients
```
FOR PROTECTION UNDER 76 & 79:
1. ✅ Mistake of FACT (not law)
2. ✅ Made in GOOD FAITH
3. ✅ With DUE CARE and ATTENTION
4. ✅ Person believed he was bound/justified by law
```

#### Difference: Section 76 vs 79

| Section 76 | Section 79 |
|------------|-----------|
| Person believes **BOUND** by law | Person believes **JUSTIFIED** by law |
| Legal compulsion | Legal justification |

### Leading Cases

**📌 R v. Tolson (1889)**
- Woman remarried after 7 years believing husband dead
- **Held:** NOT GUILTY - Reasonable mistake of fact
- **Principle:** Reasonable mistake in good faith is defense

**📌 R v. Prince (1875)**
- Took girl under 16 believing she was 18+
- **Held:** GUILTY - Act itself unlawful even if facts as believed
- **Principle:** No defense if act wrong anyway

**📌 State of West Bengal v. Shew Mangal Singh**
- Police fired on mob under Commissioner's order
- **Held:** Protected if acted in good faith with due care

### Mistake of Law

**General Rule:** NO DEFENSE (ignorantia juris non excusat)

**Limited Exceptions:**
1. Law not published
2. Relied on statute later held unconstitutional
3. Relied on judicial decision later overruled
4. Relied on official interpretation

**📌 R v. Bailey:** Ignorance of law no excuse (even if impossible to know)

---

## 🎲 ACCIDENT (SECTION 80 IPC / 18 BNS)

### All 6 Ingredients MUST Be Present

```
SECTION 80 REQUIRES ALL 6:
1. ✅ By ACCIDENT or MISFORTUNE
2. ✅ WITHOUT criminal intention/knowledge
3. ✅ While doing LAWFUL act
4. ✅ By LAWFUL means
5. ✅ In LAWFUL manner
6. ✅ With PROPER CARE & CAUTION
```

> ⚠️ **Critical:** If ANY ONE missing → Section 80 doesn't apply

### "Proper Care" = Reasonable care (not utmost care)

### Leading Cases

**📌 Tunda v. Rex**
- Death during wrestling (both friends consented)
- **Held:** NOT GUILTY - Accidental, implied consent

**📌 Jageshwar v. Emperor**
- Beating person; blow struck baby on wife's shoulder
- **Held:** GUILTY - Beating unlawful act; Section 80 doesn't apply

**📌 Bhupendra Singh v. State of Gujarat (SC)**
- Constable fired without identifying target
- **Held:** GUILTY - Lack of proper care and caution

---

## ⚖️ NECESSITY (SECTION 81 IPC / BNS)

### Maxim: "Quod necessitas non habet legem"
= Necessity knows no law

### Requirements
```
1. ✅ Act in GOOD FAITH
2. ✅ To prevent/avoid harm
3. ✅ WITHOUT criminal intention
4. ✅ Choosing LESSER evil to avoid GREATER evil
```

### Leading Case: Dudley and Stephens (1884)

**Facts:** Shipwreck; 3 men killed cabin boy to survive

**Held:** GUILTY of murder

**Principle:** Necessity NOT defense for taking human life

**Rationale:**
- Who decides whose life more valuable?
- Slippery slope argument
- Duty to sacrifice oneself

**📌 US v. Holmes:** Similar facts; convicted of manslaughter; court said should have drawn lots

**📌 Gopal Naidu v. Emperor:** Police restrained drunk man with revolver; justified under Section 81

---

## 👶 INFANCY (SECTIONS 82-83 IPC / BNS)

### Principle: "Doli Incapax" (Incapable of crime)

```
AGE-WISE LIABILITY:

0-7 YEARS (Section 82)
├─> ABSOLUTELY NO liability
├─> Presumption CONCLUSIVE
└─> Cannot be rebutted

7-12 YEARS (Section 83)
├─> REBUTTABLE presumption
├─> Prosecution must prove maturity
└─> If maturity not proved → NO liability

12+ YEARS
├─> FULL liability
└─> (But Juvenile Justice Act may apply)
```

> 🧠 **Mnemonic: "7-No, 7to12-Maybe, 12-Yes"**

### Test for Maturity (7-12 years)

Prosecution must prove child:
1. Understood NATURE of act
2. Understood CONSEQUENCES
3. Knew act was WRONG/contrary to law

### Leading Cases

**📌 Ulla Mahapatra v. The King**
- Boy 11 years; picked knife, threatened, cut person
- **Held:** GUILTY - Did what he planned = sufficient maturity

**📌 Walters v. Lunt**
- 7-year-old stole tricycle
- Parents charged with receiving stolen property
- **Held:** Acquitted (child below 7 can't steal → not stolen property)

---

## 🧠 INSANITY (SECTION 84 IPC / BNS)

### M'Naghten's Rule (1843)

**Section 84:** Person of unsound mind, incapable of:
1. Knowing NATURE of act, OR
2. Knowing act is WRONG or contrary to law

> 🧠 **Mnemonic: "N-K-W"** (Nature-Know-Wrong)

### Legal vs Medical Insanity

```
MEDICAL INSANITY
└─> Wide concept (all mental disorders)

LEGAL INSANITY (Section 84)
└─> Narrow concept
    ├─> Only when cannot know nature
    └─> OR cannot know wrong/illegal
```

### Essential Ingredients
```
1. ✅ UNSOUND MIND at time of act
2. ✅ By reason of unsoundness, INCAPABLE of:
   ├─> Knowing NATURE, OR
   └─> Knowing WRONG/contrary to law
3. ✅ CAUSATION: Unsoundness CAUSED incapacity
```

### Two-Limb Test

**LIMB 1:** Cannot know NATURE of act (complete insanity)
**LIMB 2:** Cannot know act is WRONG (partial insanity OK)

### When Must Insanity Exist?

```
BEFORE → Irrelevant (unless continuing)
DURING → ✅ CRUCIAL ("at the time of doing it")
AFTER → Irrelevant (but may be evidence)
```

### Burden of Proof

- **On Accused:** Preponderance of probabilities
- **Not:** Beyond reasonable doubt

### Leading Cases

- Crucial time = when crime committed
- Determined by conduct before, during, after

└─> LIMITED defense for specific intent crimes
```

### Section 85 Requirements
