## 🎯 INTRODUCTION TO INCHOATE CRIMES

**Inchoate** = Incomplete/Unfinished

Inchoate crimes are offenses where the actual crime is not completed but preparatory/incomplete acts are punishable.

```
INCHOATE CRIMES
├─> ABETMENT (Sections 107-116 IPC / 45-60 BNS)
├─> CONSPIRACY (Sections 120A-B IPC / 61 BNS)
└─> ATTEMPT (Section 511 IPC / 62 BNS)
```

---

## 👥 ABETMENT (SECTION 107 IPC / 45 BNS)

### Definition

A person abets an offense when he:
1. **Instigates** any person to do that thing, OR
2. Engages in **Conspiracy** for doing of that thing, OR
3. Intentionally **Aids** by act/illegal omission

> 🧠 **Mnemonic: "I-C-A"** (Instigation-Conspiracy-Aid)

---

### 1. Abetment by INSTIGATION

**Instigation** = Active suggestion, incitement, encouragement

**Methods:**
- Direct incitement
- Goading, urging
- Creating atmosphere of encouragement

**NOT Instigation:**
- Mere advice
- Casual remark
- Reporting offense to authority

---

### 2. Abetment by CONSPIRACY

**Requirements:**
- Two or more persons
- Agreement to do illegal act OR legal act by illegal means
- Overt act NOT necessary for abetment liability

---

### 3. Abetment by INTENTIONAL AID

**Requirements:**
- Aid must be INTENTIONAL

**Examples:**
- Keeping watch during burglary
- Providing weapons
- Driving getaway vehicle

---

### Important Sections

| Section | Description | Punishment |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| 109 | Abettor present when offense committed | Same as principal |
| 113 | Abettor absent when offense committed | Same as principal |
| 111 | Different offense committed | Liable if consequence of abetment |
| 115 | Abetment of death/life offense not committed | Up to 7 years + fine |

### Key Principles

✅ Can punish abettor even if principal not identified
✅ Abettor liable even if principal has defense (insanity/infancy)
✅ Impossibility no defense
✅ Abetment of abetment possible (Section 111)

---

## 🤝 CONSPIRACY (SECTION 120A-B IPC / 61 BNS)

### Definition

**Criminal Conspiracy** = Agreement between two or more persons to do:
- Illegal act, OR
- Legal act by illegal means

### Essential Ingredients

```
1. ✅ Agreement between TWO or more persons
2. ✅ To do illegal act OR legal by illegal means
3. ✅ Meeting of minds
```

### Key Principles

**Agreement is Essence:**
- Overt act NOT necessary
- Conspiracy complete when agreement made
- Even if nothing further done

**Types:**
- **Wheel Conspiracy:** One person (hub) with many (spokes)
- **Chain Conspiracy:** A→B→C→D (all liable)

### Punishment (Section 120B)

```
SERIOUS OFFENSE (death/life/2+ years)
└─> Same as abetment of that offense

MINOR OFFENSE (6 months or less/fine only)
└─> Imprisonment 6 months + fine
```

### Conspiracy vs. Abetment

| Conspiracy | Abetment |
|------------|----------|
| Agreement is offense itself | Offense must be committed |
| Two or more essential | One person can abet |
| Overt act not needed | Act towards offense needed |
| Continuing offense | Complete when act done |

---

## 🎯 ATTEMPT (SECTION 511 IPC / 62 BNS)

### Definition

**Attempt** = Direct movement towards commission after preparation

**Section 511:** Attempt to commit offense punishable with imprisonment for life/imprisonment

### Essential Ingredients

```
1. ✅ Intention to commit offense
2. ✅ Offense punishable with imprisonment
3. ✅ Act done towards commission
4. ✅ Falls SHORT of completion
5. ✅ No express provision for punishment
```

---

### Preparation vs. Attempt

| Preparation | Attempt |
|-------------|---------|
| Arranging means | Using means |
| Remote from crime | Proximate to crime |
| Equivocal act | Unequivocal act |
| NOT punishable | Punishable (511) |
| Example: Buying poison | Example: Administering poison |

### Tests to Distinguish

1. **Proximity Test:** How close to actual commission?
2. **Equivocality Test:** Does act unequivocally show criminal intent?
3. **Substantial Step Test:** Has accused taken substantial step?

---

### Impossibility

**Factual Impossibility:** NOT A DEFENSE
- A tries to steal from empty pocket → Still liable

**Legal Impossibility:** MAY BE DEFENSE
- Act attempted not actually criminal → No liability

### Punishment

**Section 511:**
- Imprisonment: Up to **1/2** of longest term for offense
- OR Fine provided for offense
- OR Both

**Example:** Murder punishable with death/life → Attempt to murder: Life or less

---

### Leading Cases

**📌 Abhayanand Mishra v. State of Bihar (SC)**
- Applied for exam with forged certificates
- **Held:** GUILTY of attempt to cheat
- **Principle:** Dispatch of application = attempt

**📌 Illustration (a) to Section 511**
- A breaks box to steal; finds empty
- **Held:** GUILTY - Did act towards commission
