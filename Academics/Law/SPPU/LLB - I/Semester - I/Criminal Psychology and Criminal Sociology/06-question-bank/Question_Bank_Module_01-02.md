#### **Q1. Explain the Classical School of Criminology in detail.**

**MODEL ANSWER:**

**INTRODUCTION**

The Classical School of Criminology emerged in the mid-18th century as a rational and humane alternative to the barbaric practices of the Pre-Classical era. The school was founded by **Cesare Beccaria** (Italian criminologist) and **Jeremy Bentham** (English philosopher) around 1764, marking a revolutionary shift from supernatural explanations to rational understanding of crime.

---

**CORE PRINCIPLES OF CLASSICAL SCHOOL**

The Classical School is based on the following fundamental principles, which can be remembered using the mnemonic **"FREE"**:

**1. Free Will and Rationality**

The Classical School posits that human beings possess **free will** and are rational actors. According to this view:
- Individuals make conscious choices between right and wrong
- Criminals **rationally decide** to commit crimes
- Crime is a product of rational calculation, not supernatural forces or biological defects
- Humans are responsible for their actions

**2. Hedonistic Calculus (Pleasure vs Pain)**

Bentham introduced the concept of **hedonistic calculus**, which suggests:
- Humans naturally seek **pleasure** and avoid **pain**
- Before committing a crime, a person weighs the benefits (pleasure from crime) against the costs (punishment/pain)
- If perceived benefits exceed costs → Crime occurs
- If costs exceed benefits → Person refrains from crime

**Mathematical Expression**: If **Benefits of Crime > Costs of Crime**, then individual commits crime.

**3. Punishment as Deterrent**

The primary purpose of punishment in Classical School is **deterrence**:

*Specific Deterrence*: Prevent the individual offender from committing future crimes
*General Deterrence*: Deter others in society from committing similar crimes

**Principles of Effective Punishment:**
- **Proportionate**: Must fit the crime, not the criminal
- **Certain**: High probability of being caught and punished
- **Swift**: Quick punishment after crime
- **Public**: Visible to society for general deterrence

According to Beccaria, **certainty** of punishment is more important than severity.

**4. Equality Before Law**

The Classical School emphasized:
- All individuals are equal before the law
- Same crime should receive same punishment regardless of the criminal's status
- Written laws to ensure consistency
- No arbitrary or discriminatory punishment

---

**LEGAL REFORMS ADVOCATED BY CLASSICAL SCHOOL**

Cesare Beccaria, in his seminal work **"On Crimes and Punishments" (1764)**, advocated for several reforms:

**1. Abolition of Torture**
- Condemned torture as inhumane and unreliable
- Torture produces false confessions

**2. Abolition of Capital Punishment**
- Argued that death penalty is ineffective as deterrent
- Life imprisonment is sufficient

**3. Proportionality**
- Punishment should be proportionate to the harm caused by crime
- Not based on criminal's status or arbitrary factors

**4. Certainty over Severity**
- It is better to have certain but moderate punishment
- Than severe but uncertain punishment
- Fear of inevitable punishment is greater deterrent

**5. Prevention is Better than Punishment**
- Focus should be on preventing crime
- Through education, clear laws, and social conditions

**6. Written and Clear Laws**
- Laws should be written, clear, and publicly accessible
- Citizens should know what is forbidden
- Judges should apply law mechanically, without interpretation

---

**CRITICISM OF CLASSICAL SCHOOL**

Despite its revolutionary contribution, the Classical School has several limitations:

**1. Ignores Individual Differences**
- Treats all criminals alike
- No consideration of age (children), mental state, or circumstances
- Rigid application regardless of individual capacity

**2. Assumes Perfect Rationality**
- Not all criminals act rationally
- Crimes of passion, emotion, impulse ignored
- Mental illness and developmental disabilities not considered
- Assumes all individuals have equal capacity to reason

**3. Ignores Social and Economic Factors**
- No consideration of poverty, unemployment, lack of education
- Environmental and familial factors ignored
- Assumes all individuals have equal opportunities

**4. Rigid Approach to Punishment**
- Same punishment for same crime creates injustice
- No flexibility for mitigating circumstances
- First-time offenders treated same as repeat offenders

**5. Unrealistic View of Free Will**
- Many factors constrain free will (poverty, mental illness, addiction)
- Biological, psychological, and social influences limit choice
- Concept of absolute free will is philosophically debatable

---

**CONCLUSION**

The Classical School made invaluable contributions to modern criminal justice, including the principles of **legality** (no crime without law), **proportionality**, **due process**, and **equality before law**. While its rigid approach was later modified by the Neo-Classical School to account for individual circumstances, and the Positivist School challenged its free will assumption, the Classical School laid the foundation for humane and rational criminal justice systems worldwide. Its emphasis on deterrence, certainty, and proportionality continues to influence criminal law and policy today.

#### **Q2. Discuss Cesare Lombroso's theory of the "Born Criminal".**

**MODEL ANSWER:**

**INTRODUCTION**

Cesare Lombroso (1835-1909) was an Italian physician and criminologist who is widely regarded as the **"Father of Modern Criminology"** and the **"Father of Criminal Anthropology."** His groundbreaking work, **"L'Uomo Delinquente" (The Criminal Man, 1876)**, introduced a biological and scientific approach to understanding crime. Lombroso's theory of the "born criminal" represents a radical departure from the Classical School's emphasis on free will and rational choice.

---

**CORE THEORY: BORN CRIMINAL**

Lombroso's central thesis can be summarized as:

> **"Criminals are born, not made."**

According to Lombroso, criminality is an **innate characteristic** that certain individuals possess from birth due to their biological and evolutionary makeup.

---

**ATAVISM THEORY**

Lombroso developed the **atavism theory** to explain the born criminal:

**Definition of Atavism**: A throwback to an earlier stage of evolution; reversion to primitive ancestors.

**Lombroso's Argument**:
- Criminals represent **evolutionary throwbacks** or reversions
- They resemble primitive humans or even apes in physical and mental characteristics
- Criminals are **biological abnormalities** - less evolved than normal humans
- They possess traits of earlier evolutionary stages

**Biological Basis**:
- Hereditary factors
- Degeneration of genetic material
- Congenital defects
- Epilepsy and other conditions

---

**PHYSICAL STIGMATA (IDENTIFYING MARKS)**

Lombroso claimed that born criminals can be **identified by physical characteristics** - visible signs of their atavistic nature. He identified numerous **physical stigmata**:

**Cranial and Facial Features**:
1. **Abnormal skull shape** (unusually large or small)
2. **Sloping forehead** (low, receding forehead)
3. **Large or prominent jaw** (pronounced jawbone)
4. **Prominent or high cheekbones**
5. **Asymmetrical face** (one side different from other)
6. **Small, deep-set eyes** or unusual eye characteristics
7. **Large ears** or ears standing out
8. **Twisted or flattened nose**
9. **Fleshy lips** or thin lips
10. **Sparse beard** or unusual facial hair

**Body Features**:
1. **Long arms** (resembling apes - arms reaching below knees)
2. **Excessive tattoos** (indicator of insensitivity to pain and antisocial tendencies)
3. **Abnormal teeth** (extra teeth, gaps, unusual arrangement)
4. **Extra fingers or toes** (polydactyly)
5. **Large or unusual hands and feet**

**Other Characteristics**:
- Insensitivity to pain
- Acute eyesight
- Lack of moral sense
- Absence of remorse

Lombroso claimed that presence of **five or more stigmata** indicated a born criminal.

---

**CLASSIFICATION OF CRIMINALS (LOMBROSO)**

Later in his career, Lombroso modified his theory to recognize that not all criminals are "born." He classified criminals into **four types**:

**1. Born Criminals (Atavistic Type)**
- Constitute approximately **40%** of all criminals
- Possess physical stigmata
- Biologically driven to commit crime
- **Cannot be reformed** - criminality is innate
- Most dangerous type

**2. Insane Criminals**
- Commit crimes due to **mental illness**
- Include: Alcoholics, mentally retarded, epileptics, psychotics
- Need **medical treatment** rather than punishment
- Mental disease causes criminal behavior

**3. Criminaloids**
- **Not born criminals** but have weak nature
- Commit crimes under certain conditions or circumstances
- Influenced by environment and opportunity
- **Can be reformed** with appropriate intervention
- Less dangerous than born criminals

**4. Criminals of Passion**
- Commit crimes under **strong emotion** or passion
- Provocation, anger, love, honor
- Otherwise **normal, law-abiding** individuals
- Act under extraordinary circumstances
- Unlikely to repeat offense

---

**LOMBROSO'S RESEARCH METHODOLOGY**

Lombroso's conclusions were based on:
- Examination of **cadavers** of executed criminals
- Measurement of **skulls and body parts** (anthropometry)
- Comparison with non-criminals (though limited)
- Case studies of living criminals
- Post-mortem examinations

He claimed to have studied thousands of criminals and identified consistent physical patterns.

---

**CRITICISM OF LOMBROSO'S THEORY**

Despite its historical significance, Lombroso's theory has been extensively criticized and is now largely discredited:

**1. Unscientific Methodology**
- **Small and biased sample size**: Mostly studied Italian criminals
- **No proper control group**: Inadequate comparison with non-criminals
- **Selection bias**: Examined only convicted criminals, not general population
- **Faulty measurements**: Inconsistent measuring techniques
- **Confirmation bias**: Looked for evidence supporting pre-existing beliefs

**2. Physical Stigmata Discredited**
- Charles Goring's study (1913): Found no significant physical differences between criminals and non-criminals
- Many criminals have **completely normal appearance**
- Many **law-abiding citizens** possess these so-called stigmata
- Physical features do not reliably predict criminality

**3. Ignores Social and Environmental Factors**
- Completely overlooks **poverty**, which was rampant among Italian criminals Lombroso studied
- No consideration of **education, family, social conditions**
- Over-emphasis on biology
- Most criminals come from disadvantaged backgrounds, not biological abnormality

**4. Biological Determinism**
- Removes individual **responsibility** and **free will**
- Fatalistic approach - if born criminal, cannot be reformed
- No room for rehabilitation
- Contradicts principles of justice

**5. Ethical and Social Issues**
- **Stigmatization** based on physical appearance
- Discrimination against individuals with certain physical features
- Used to justify harsh treatment and permanent incarceration
- Racial and ethnic biases (certain groups stereotyped)

**6. Later Modifications Undermined Theory**
- Lombroso himself reduced percentage of born criminals from 100% to 40%
- Acknowledged role of environment (criminaloids)
- Recognized occasional criminals
- These modifications weakened the core theory

---

**HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE**

Despite its flaws, Lombroso's work was important because:
- Introduced **scientific method** to study of crime
- Shifted focus to studying the **criminal** (not just crime)
- Encouraged **empirical research** in criminology
- Pioneered use of **case studies** and **data collection**
- Influenced development of **positivist criminology**
- Led to individualized treatment approaches

---

**CONCLUSION**

While Lombroso's theory of the born criminal based on physical stigmata has been thoroughly discredited by modern research, his contribution to criminology as a scientific discipline remains significant. Lombroso was the first to systematically study criminals using scientific methods, paving the way for the positivist school. However, contemporary criminology recognizes that crime is caused by a complex interaction of biological, psychological, and social factors, and that physical appearance cannot reliably identify criminals. The theory serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of biological determinism and the importance of rigorous scientific methodology.

#### **Q3. Explain Enrico Ferri's contribution to criminology.**

**MODEL ANSWER:**

**INTRODUCTION**

Enrico Ferri (1856-1929) was an Italian criminologist and a student of Cesare Lombroso. He is often called the **"Father of the Positive School"** of criminology. His major work, **"Criminal Sociology" (1884)**, expanded criminological thought beyond Lombroso's purely biological approach. Ferri introduced a more comprehensive, **multi-factorial approach** to understanding crime, incorporating sociological and environmental factors alongside biological ones.

---

**FERRI'S MULTIPLE FACTOR APPROACH**

Unlike Lombroso, who focused primarily on biological factors, Ferri argued that crime is caused by the **interaction of three types of factors**. This can be remembered using the mnemonic **"PAS"**:

**1. PHYSICAL (Natural/Environmental) FACTORS**

These are natural environmental conditions that influence crime:
- **Climate and Weather**: Temperature, humidity
- **Geographical Location**: Urban vs rural, mountainous vs plains
- **Seasons**: Crime patterns vary by season
- **Agricultural Conditions**: Harvest failures, droughts

**Ferri's Observation**: 
- Crimes against person (assault, murder) increase in **summer** (heat causes irritability)
- Property crimes (theft, burglary) increase in **winter** (need for food, warmth)

**2. ANTHROPOLOGICAL (Individual) FACTORS**

These relate to the individual characteristics of the offender:

*Biological*:
- Age (youth more impulsive)
- Sex (males more violent)
- Race (controversial and now rejected)
- Heredity (genetic predispositions)
- Physical constitution (health, strength)

*Psychological*:
- Intelligence level
- Temperament (calm vs aggressive)
- Mental state (sane vs insane)
- Emotional stability

**3. SOCIAL (Environmental) FACTORS**

These are social and cultural conditions affecting crime:
- **Population Density**: Crowded areas have more crime
- **Urbanization**: Cities have higher crime rates than rural areas
- **Economic Conditions**: Poverty, unemployment, economic inequality
- **Education Level**: Lack of education increases crime (but educated commit sophisticated crimes)
- **Religion**: Moral guidance and social control
- **Family Structure**: Strong families reduce crime
- **Public Opinion**: Community attitudes toward crime
- **Political System**: Type of government, law enforcement effectiveness
- **Customs and Traditions**: Cultural norms

---

**FERRI'S LAW OF CRIMINAL SATURATION**

Ferri introduced the concept of **"criminal saturation"**, which can be explained through an analogy:

> Just as a chemical solution can only dissolve a certain amount of salt (determined by temperature and composition), every society has a certain level of crime determined by its physical, anthropological, and social conditions.

**Implications**:
- Crime level in a society is **determined** by the combination of these three factors
- To reduce crime, must **change these underlying conditions**
- **Punishment alone** cannot eliminate crime
- Social reform is essential

---

**FERRI'S CLASSIFICATION OF CRIMINALS**

Ferri classified criminals into **five types** based on the predominant causes of their criminal behavior:

| Type | Cause | Description | Reformability |
|------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **1. Born/Instinctive Criminals** | Biological/Genetic | Born with criminal tendencies, similar to Lombroso's born criminal | Difficult to reform |
| **2. Insane Criminals** | Mental Illness | Criminality due to mental disorder, need medical treatment | Depends on treatment |
| **3. Habitual Criminals** | Environment/Society | Become criminal due to social environment and repeated exposure | Can be reformed with environmental change |
| **4. Occasional Criminals** | Opportunity/Circumstances | Commit crime by chance or under specific circumstances, not career criminals | Easy to reform |
| **5. Passionate/Emotional Criminals** | Strong Emotion | Act under passion, provocation, love, honor | Usually don't repeat |

---

**FERRI'S PENAL SUBSTITUTES**

Ferri's most innovative contribution was the concept of **"penal substitutes"** - **social measures** to prevent crime rather than relying solely on punishment.

**Examples of Penal Substitutes**:

**Economic Measures**:
- **Free trade** to reduce unemployment
- **Fair wages** for workers
- **Economic opportunities** for disadvantaged

**Social Measures**:
- **Cheap housing** for the poor
- **Better street lighting** in urban areas (reduces crime opportunity)
- **Public recreation facilities** (keep youth engaged)
- **Reform of marriage and divorce laws** (strengthen families)

**Educational Measures**:
- **Accessible education** for all classes
- **Vocational training** programs
- **Moral education** in schools

**Other Measures**:
- **Regulation of alcohol** (reduce alcohol-related crimes)
- **Tax reforms** (reduce economic inequality)
- **Child welfare programs** (prevent juvenile delinquency)

**Philosophy Behind Penal Substitutes**:
- **Prevention** is better than punishment
- Address **root causes** of crime
- **Social reform** can reduce crime saturation level
- Punishment treats symptoms, penal substitutes treat disease

---

**CRITICISM OF FERRI'S THEORY**

**1. Difficult to Measure**
- How to quantify interaction of three factors?
- Which factor is most important?
- Individual cases vary significantly

**2. Oversimplification**
- Crime causation more complex than three categories
- Psychological factors not fully developed
- Individual agency and choice minimized

**3. Deterministic**
- Like Lombroso, reduces individual responsibility
- If crime is determined by factors, where is free will?
- Undermines accountability

**4. Impractical Penal Substitutes**
- Some suggestions too broad (economic reform)
- Require massive social change
- Politically difficult to implement
- May not directly reduce crime

---

**CONCLUSION**

Enrico Ferri made significant contributions to criminology by broadening the understanding of crime causation beyond purely biological factors. His **multiple factor approach** (PAS), **classification of criminals**, **law of criminal saturation**, and innovative concept of **penal substitutes** shifted criminology towards a more **sociological** and **preventive** orientation. While his deterministic approach has limitations, Ferri's emphasis on **social reform** and **crime prevention** through addressing root causes continues to influence modern criminal justice policies. His work represents an important bridge between Lombroso's biological positivism and modern sociological theories of crime.

#### **Q4. Write a short note on Gabriel Tarde's Laws of Imitation.**

**MODEL ANSWER:**

**INTRODUCTION**

Gabriel Tarde (1843-1904) was a French sociologist and criminologist who opposed the biological positivism of Lombroso. In his work **"The Laws of Imitation" (1890)**, Tarde argued that criminal behavior is **learned through imitation**, not inherited biologically. This made him a precursor to modern social learning theories.

---

**TARDE'S THREE LAWS OF IMITATION**

**1. Law of Close Contact**

> "Imitation occurs between individuals who are in close physical and social contact."

- People imitate those **near** to them - family, friends, neighbors
- Children imitate parents
- Juveniles imitate gang members
- Urban residents imitate urban patterns
- Close association with criminals leads to learning criminal behavior

**2. Law of Imitation of Superiors by Inferiors**

> "The inferior imitates the superior."

- Lower class imitates upper class
- Subordinates imitate leaders
- Young imitate old
- Less educated imitate educated
- Fashion, lifestyle, and even crime methods spread from upper to lower classes

**3. Law of Insertion**

> "New patterns of behavior supersede old patterns."

- When two patterns conflict, the new replaces the old
- Modern methods replace traditional methods
- Innovation in crime techniques
- Technology changes crime patterns (e.g., cyber crimes replace traditional crimes)

---

**SIGNIFICANCE**

Tarde's theory was significant because:
- Emphasized **social** rather than **biological** factors
- Criminal behavior is **learned**, not inherited
- **Environment** and **associations** matter
- Provided foundation for later **social learning theories** (Sutherland's Differential Association)

Tarde directly challenged Lombroso's biological determinism, arguing that if crime is learned through imitation, it can also be unlearned through proper socialization and environment.

#### **Q5. Distinguish between Classical and Neo-Classical Schools of Criminology.**

**MODEL ANSWER:**

The Classical and Neo-Classical Schools are closely related, with the Neo-Classical School emerging as a **modification** of the Classical School to address its rigidity.

---

**COMPARISON TABLE**

| Aspect | Classical School | Neo-Classical School |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Time Period** | Mid-18th century (1764+) | Late 18th to early 19th century |
| **Free Will** | **Absolute** free will assumed | **Modified** free will (constrained by circumstances) |
| **Focus** | Crime-centered (what was done) | Partial shift to criminal (who did it) |
| **Punishment** | **Fixed** for each type of crime | **Flexible** based on individual circumstances |
| **Age** | Not considered (all treated same) | **Children treated differently** - diminished responsibility |
| **Mental State** | Ignored (all assumed sane) | **Mental illness considered** - insanity as defense |
| **Circumstances** | Not considered | **Mitigating and aggravating** circumstances recognized |
| **Judicial Role** | Mechanical application of law | **Discretion** in sentencing |

---

**KEY MODIFICATIONS BY NEO-CLASSICAL SCHOOL**

1. **Recognition of Diminished Responsibility**:
   - Mental illness (insanity)
   - Young age (infancy)
   - Other circumstances that limit free will

2. **Judicial Discretion**:
   - Judges can consider individual circumstances
   - Flexibility in sentencing
   - Not rigid application

3. **Individualization**:
   - Partial move toward considering the criminal, not just crime
   - First-time offenders may be treated more leniently

---

**CONCLUSION**

The Neo-Classical School **retained** the core principles of the Classical School (free will, deterrence, proportionality) but **added flexibility** to account for human limitations and individual circumstances. This modification made the criminal justice system more humane and realistic, recognizing that not all individuals have equal capacity for rational choice. Most modern legal systems reflect **neo-classical** principles.

## 📚 **MODULE 02: PSYCHOLOGY AND CRIME**

### **SECTION A: 10-MARK QUESTIONS**

---

#### **Q6. Explain Sigmund Freud's Psychoanalytic Theory of Crime.**

**MODEL ANSWER:**

**INTRODUCTION**

Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) was an Austrian neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis. His psychoanalytic theory represented a revolutionary approach to understanding human behavior, including criminal behavior. The **psychoanalytic approach** to crime argues that criminal behavior originates primarily in the **personalities of offenders** rather than their biology or external situation, and that early childhood experiences play a crucial role in shaping personality.

---

**FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE**

**Personality Definition**: Reasonably stable patterns of behavior, including thoughts, feelings, and emotions, that distinguish people from one another and control how a person adapts to life experiences.

**Core Argument**:
> Criminal behavior is rooted in **personality disturbances** and **unresolved childhood conflicts**. The psychoanalytic model depicts the criminal offender as an **aggressive, frustrated person dominated by events that occurred early in childhood**.

---

**FREUD'S THREE-PART PERSONALITY STRUCTURE**

Freud postulated that human personality consists of **three interacting systems**: Id, Ego, and Superego. This structure can be remembered using the mnemonic **"IES"**.

**1. THE ID (Pleasure Principle)**

**Nature**:
- **Primitive** part of personality
- Present **from birth**
- Entirely **unconscious**
- Biological and instinctual

**Represents**:
- Unconscious biological drives and impulses
- Basic needs: Food, water, air, sleep
- Sexual drive (libido)
- Aggressive impulses
- Immediate gratification

**Operating Principle**: **"I want it NOW!"**
- Seeks immediate satisfaction of desires
- No regard for reality or morality
- Operates on pleasure principle
- Irrational and impulsive

**2. THE EGO (Reality Principle)**

**Nature**:
- Develops from Id during childhood
- Partly **conscious**, partly unconscious
- Executive of personality
- **Mediator** between Id and external world

**Function**:
- Compensates for demands of Id
- Helps guide actions within social boundaries
- Considers what is **practical** and **conventional**
- Evaluates reality and consequences
- Delays gratification when necessary

**Operating Principle**: **"Let's be practical and realistic"**
- Seeks to satisfy Id's desires in socially acceptable ways
- Balances pleasure with reality
- Problem-solving and planning

**3. THE SUPEREGO (Morality Principle)**

**Nature**:
- Develops later (around age 5-6)
- **Moral component** of personality
- Partly conscious (values), partly unconscious (guilt)
- Conscience and ego-ideal

**Development**:
- Develops when child **internalizes** moral standards
- Incorporates values of **parents** and **community**
- Social norms, ethics, and ideals
- "Voice of conscience"

**Function**:
- Controls Id's unacceptable impulses
- Guides Ego toward moral behavior
- Creates **guilt** when rules violated
- Strives for perfection and moral goodness

**Operating Principle**: **"That's wrong! Don't do it!"**
- Represents societal rules internalized
- Creates anxiety (guilt) for moral violations

---

**PSYCHOANALYTIC EXPLANATION OF CRIME**

According to Freud, criminal behavior results from an **imbalance** among the three personality components:

**Scenario 1: Overdeveloped Id + Weak Ego/Superego**
- Strong primitive urges (Id)
- Weak Ego cannot control impulses
- Weak or absent Superego provides no moral restraint
- **Result**: **Impulsive, violent crimes** - Acting on immediate desires without consideration of consequences or morality
- Example: Crimes of passion, spontaneous violence

**Scenario 2: Underdeveloped Superego**
- Id's demands not adequately controlled
- No internalized moral values
- Absence of guilt or remorse
- **Result**: **Psychopathic behavior** - Chronic criminality without conscience
- Example: Serial offenders, psychopaths who feel no guilt

**Scenario 3: Overdeveloped Superego**
- Excessive, harsh conscience
- Unbearable guilt feelings
- **Result**: **Crime as self-punishment** - Individual commits crime unconsciously to be punished and relieve guilt
- Example: Leaving obvious clues, confessing readily

**Scenario 4: Conflict Between Id and Superego**
- Id wants gratification, Superego forbids it
- Ego unable to mediate effectively
- **Result**: Internal tension leading to criminal acting out

---

**ROLE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES**

Freud emphasized that **early childhood experiences** (especially first 5 years) are crucial in personality development:

**Critical Stages**:
- **Oral Stage** (0-1 year): Fixation leads to dependency, substance abuse
- **Anal Stage** (1-3 years): Fixation leads to obsessive or destructive behavior
- **Phallic Stage** (3-5 years): Oedipus/Electra complex, identification with same-sex parent
- **Latency** (5-12 years): Social skills development
- **Genital Stage** (12+ years): Mature sexuality

**Criminal Implications**:
- **Trauma** during these stages affects personality
- **Unresolved conflicts** manifest as criminal behavior in adulthood
- **Faulty parenting** creates personality disturbances
- **Lack of proper identification** with parents leads to weak Superego

---

**EMOTIONAL IMBALANCE AS MAIN FACTOR**

Freud considered **emotional imbalance** as the main factor in crime causation:

> "Mentally and emotionally defective people are more prone to crime than persons who are emotionally stable."

**Types of Emotional Disturbances Leading to Crime**:
- Unresolved childhood traumas
- Fixations at early developmental stages
- Unconscious guilt seeking punishment
- Aggression and destructive impulses
- Inadequate ego development

---

**CRITICISM**

**1. Unscientific and Untestable**
- Based on case studies, not experiments
- Unconscious mind cannot be directly observed or measured
- Difficult to prove or disprove
- Lacks empirical support

**2. Overemphasis on Childhood**
- Not all criminals had traumatic childhoods
- Many people with difficult childhoods don't become criminals
- Adult experiences and choices matter

**3. Deterministic**
- Removes individual responsibility
- If personality is shaped by childhood, where is free will?
- Undermines accountability

**4. Limited Applicability**
- Cannot explain all types of crime
- Particularly weak for organized, rational crimes
- Better for understanding impulsive, violent crimes

**5. Treatment Difficulties**
- Psychoanalysis is lengthy and expensive
- Not practical for all criminals
- Results unclear

---

**CONCLUSION**

Despite its limitations, Freud's psychoanalytic theory made valuable contributions to criminology by highlighting the importance of **personality structure**, **emotional factors**, and **early childhood experiences** in shaping criminal behavior. While the theory is not scientifically robust by modern standards, it influenced the development of **psychiatric and psychological** approaches to understanding and treating criminals. The emphasis on the **individual's internal psychological processes** complemented the sociological approaches and enriched criminological thought. Modern psychology has moved beyond Freudian theory, but his insight that early experiences and personality matter remains relevant.

#### **Q7. Discuss the various causes of criminal behaviour.**

**MODEL ANSWER:**

**INTRODUCTION**

Criminal behavior is a complex phenomenon influenced by multiple factors. Understanding the causes of criminal behavior is essential for developing effective prevention and intervention strategies. According to Andrews and Bonta, criminal behavior can be defined from legal, moral, social, and psychological perspectives. Comprehensively, it can be understood as **anti-social behavior punishable by law or community norms**. Various factors contribute to the development of criminal behavior, which can be remembered using the mnemonic **"FAMILY"**.

---

**SIX MAJOR CAUSES OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOUR**

**1. FINANCIAL PROBLEMS OR STARVATION**

**Nature of Cause**:
- Extreme poverty and economic deprivation
- Struggle for daily survival
- Inability to meet basic needs (food, shelter)

**Mechanism**:
- Economic desperation pushes individuals toward crime
- Survival instinct overrides moral considerations
- Property crimes become means of survival

**Examples**:
- Theft of food by hungry person
- Burglary to pay rent and avoid homelessness
- Robbery for immediate financial need

**Research Support**: Strong correlation between poverty and property crime, though most poor people do NOT commit crime.

---

**2. LOW SOCIAL STATUS**

**Nature of Cause**:
- Inferior position in social hierarchy
- Lack of respect and recognition
- Social marginalization and exclusion

**Mechanism**:
- Feelings of **resentment** and **injustice**
- Person may become **aggressive**
- **Fight back** against society that rejects them
- Crime as means to gain status or express frustration

**Psychological Impact**:
- Sense of relative deprivation (comparing self to others)
- Frustration from blocked opportunities
- Desire to achieve success through any means

**Examples**:
- Youth join gangs to gain respect
- Violent retaliation against perceived discrimination
- Property crime to acquire status symbols

---

**3. MENTAL ILLNESS**

**Nature of Cause**:
- Various mental disorders and psychological conditions
- Impaired judgment and decision-making
- Inability to control impulses

**Types and Criminal Relevance**:

*Psychosis* (Schizophrenia, Paranoia):
- Loss of contact with reality
- Hallucinations and delusions
- May commit crimes based on false beliefs
- **Legal**: Covered under Section 84 IPC (insanity defense)

*Personality Disorders*:
- **Antisocial Personality Disorder** (Psychopathy/Sociopathy) - **Most criminal type**
- No conscience or empathy
- Manipulative and impulsive
- Persistent criminal behavior

*Depression and Anxiety*:
- May lead to self-medication (substance abuse)
- Impaired judgment
- Suicidal or violent behavior

*Mental Retardation*:
- Low IQ (below 70)
- Poor judgment and reasoning
- Easily influenced by others
- May not understand consequences

**Caveat**: Not all mentally ill persons are criminals. Only certain conditions and only in specific circumstances increase crime risk.

---

**4. ANTI-SOCIAL VALUES**

**Nature of Cause**:
- Belief system that justifies or normalizes criminal behavior
- Rejection of conventional moral standards
- Adoption of deviant value system

**Characteristics**:
- Individuals believe **criminal behavior is justified** in certain situations
- Rationalize lawbreaking
- Lack internalized moral prohibitions
- Peer group reinforces anti-social values

**Development**:

- Peer influence (delinquent friends)
- Subcultural values (gang norms)
- Media influence (glamorization of crime)

**Examples**:
- "It's okay to steal from rich people"
- "Snitches get stitches" (anti-informant culture)

---

**5. LACK OF FAMILY SUPPORT**

**Nature of Cause**:
- Absence of emotional, financial, or moral support from family
- Dysfunctional family environment
- Poor family relationships

**Specific Family Factors**:

*Structural*:

- Single-parent households
- Absent parents (both working long hours)

*Functional*:
- **Lack of emotional support** and affection
- **Poor communication** between family members
- **Inability to solve problems** together
- **Conflict and violence** within family
- **Neglect or abuse** of children

*Criminal Family*:
- Parents or siblings involved in crime
- Criminal behavior modeled

**Mechanism**:
- Weak family bonds reduce informal social control
- Child lacks guidance and supervision
- Poor problem-solving skills developed
- Seek belonging in deviant peer groups

**Impact**:
- Juveniles without family support more likely to join gangs
- Lack emotional regulation skills
- Unable to cope with stress legitimately

---

**6. LOW SELF-CONTROL**

**Nature of Cause**:
- Inability to control impulses and delay gratification
- Poor emotional and behavioral regulation
- Failure to consider consequences

**Characteristics of Low Self-Control**:
- **Impulsivity**: Act without thinking
- **Short-sighted**: Focus on immediate, not long-term
- **Risk-seeking**: Attracted to dangerous activities
- **Physical**: Prefer physical over mental activities
- **Self-centered**: Insensitive to others
- **Low frustration tolerance**: Quick to anger

**Development**:
- Established in early childhood (before age 10)
- Result of poor parenting:
  - Lack of monitoring
  - Inconsistent discipline
  - Failure to recognize and correct deviant behavior
  - Neglect

**Mechanism**:
- Fail to think before acting
- Commit crime **without planning**
- Don't consider consequences
- Act on immediate desires and emotions
- Cannot resist temptation

**Criminal Pattern**:
- Impulsive crimes (assault, spontaneous theft)
- Poor planning (often caught)
- Repeat offending (don't learn from punishment)
- Versatile offending (various crime types)

**Research**: Low self-control predicts not only crime but also accidents, substance abuse, poor health, and unstable relationships (Gottfredson & Hirschi).

**INTERACTION OF CAUSES**

> 📌 **Important**: These causes often **interact** and **reinforce** each other:

Example:
- Poverty (Cause 1) → Low social status (Cause 2) → Family stress (Cause 5) → Poor parenting → Low self-control (Cause 6) → Criminal behavior

It is rarely a single cause but a **combination** that leads to criminal behavior.

---

**CONCLUSION**

Criminal behavior is **multi-causal**, stemming from economic (financial problems), social (low status, family), psychological (mental illness, low self-control), and cognitive (anti-social values) factors. Understanding these causes is essential for developing comprehensive **prevention** and **intervention** strategies. While presence of these factors increases risk, they are not deterministic - many individuals facing these challenges do not turn to crime, highlighting the role of **protective factors** (resilience, positive relationships, opportunities) and **individual agency**. Effective crime reduction requires addressing multiple causes simultaneously through social policy, family support, mental health services, and community programs.

**LEGAL FRAMEWORK IN INDIA**

**Section 84, Indian Penal Code:**

> "Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law."

**Requirements for Insanity Defense**:
1. Unsoundness of mind at time of act
2. Cannot know nature of act, OR
3. Cannot know act is wrong/illegal

**Modern Approach**: Emphasizes **treatment** rather than punishment for mentally ill offenders, with specialized forensic mental health facilities.

---

**CONCLUSION**

While some mental illnesses increase risk of criminal behavior, the relationship is not simple or direct. Most mentally ill people are NOT criminals, and most criminals are NOT mentally ill. The association is strongest for antisocial personality disorder. Modern criminal justice recognizes the need for appropriate assessment, treatment, and humane handling of mentally ill offenders, balancing public safety with therapeutic intervention.

**3. Social Learning Theory (Bandura)**: Aggression is learned through observation and reinforcement; Bobo doll experiment proved children imitate aggressive models

---

**FACTORS IN AGGRESSION**

**Biological**: Brain structures (amygdala, prefrontal cortex), neurotransmitters (serotonin, testosterone), genetics

**Environmental**: Family violence, peer influence, media violence, alcohol/drugs

---

**CONCLUSION**

Understanding types of aggression helps in criminal investigation, profiling, and treatment. Hostile aggression may indicate emotional dysregulation requiring anger management, while instrumental aggression suggests calculated criminality requiring different intervention. Modern approaches combine biological, psychological, and social perspectives for comprehensive understanding and prevention.

## 📝 **SHORT NOTES (2-MARK FORMAT)**

### **Q10. Alfred Adler's Theory**

Alfred Adler, founder of Individual Psychology, argued that **inferiority complex** is the main cause of crime. According to Adler, persons with physical defects, ugly appearance, or low social status develop feelings of inadequacy and inferiority. These individuals may compensate for their inferiority through criminal behavior, attempting to prove their superiority or gain status through deviant means. The theory emphasizes psychological compensation as a criminogenic factor.

### **Q11. August Aichorn's Contribution**

August Aichorn identified **faulty methods of child training** as the most important cause of crime. He argued that parents are responsible for making children criminal in **both cases**: when parents give **no love** (neglect) or when parents give **too much love** (over-indulgence). Both extremes are harmful. Neglected children feel unloved and develop antisocial tendencies, while over-indulgenced children cannot accept limits and turn to crime when denied. Proper balance in child-rearing is essential for crime prevention.
