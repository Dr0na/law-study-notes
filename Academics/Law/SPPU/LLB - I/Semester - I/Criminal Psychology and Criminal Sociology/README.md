## 🎓 **EXAM PATTERN & STRATEGY**

### **Typical Exam Pattern**

**Total**: 80 marks, 3 hours (180 minutes)

**Distribution (Likely)**:
- 4 questions of 10 marks each = 40 marks

- Choose questions you know BEST (not first ones you see)
- Plan which to attempt in which order

**Writing Order**:
- Start with **strongest answer** (builds confidence, ensures good start)
- Do high-mark questions first (10-mark, then 5-mark, then 2-mark)
- If time short at end, easier to write short 2-mark answers quickly

**Presentation**:
- Diagrams worth 1-2 marks each
- Tables make concepts clearer
- Underlining helps examiner spot key terms
- Headings make scanning easy
- All improve scoring
