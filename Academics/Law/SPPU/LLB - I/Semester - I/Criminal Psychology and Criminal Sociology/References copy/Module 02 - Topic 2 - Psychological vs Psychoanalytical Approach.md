## 🧠 **PSYCHOANALYTICAL APPROACH TO CRIME**

### Foundation

The psychoanalytical approach to crime is based upon the **psychoanalytic theory of Sigmund Freud**.

---

---

## 📋 **Core Principles of Psychoanalytic Theory**

### Primary Argument

The psychoanalytic theories argue that **criminal behaviour originates primarily in the personalities of offenders** rather than in their biology or in situation.

---

### Personality Definition

**Personality** refers to the reasonably stable patterns of behaviour, including:
- Thoughts
- Feelings
- Emotions

That distinguish people from one another.

**Function:** Personality controls a person's way of adapting to life experiences and therefore separates people on the basis of their behaviour.

---

### Link to Criminality

**Psycho-criminologists** link criminality with disturbances of the personality and maintain that:

> Persons with an **abnormal personality**, whatever the cause, will be more likely to engage in **anti-social behaviour** because they view the world differently.

---

### Summary of Theory

In short, the psychoanalytic theory depicts the criminal offender as:

> **An aggressive, frustrated person dominated by events that occurred early in childhood.**

---

## 🔑 **TWO CATEGORIES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS**

According to this theory, psychos are of 2 categories:

### 1. Physical Defects and Incapacities

**Psychological depravity** in a person due to physical defects and incapacities is an important reason for criminality.

**Examples:**
- Persons who are deaf, dumb
- Those who suffer from physical deformities
- Suffer loss of social status
- Tend to commit crime more frequently

---

### 2. Appearance-Based Complex

**Persons with:**
- Ugly look
- Dark complexion

**Are also likely to:**
- Behave criminally
- Mostly indulge in offences because of **inferiority complex**
- Think they are being neglected because of physical deformities
- Generate feeling that they are outcast
- Irritation instigates them to commit criminal acts

---

## 🧠 **SIGMUND FREUD'S THEORY**

### Emotional Imbalance as Main Factor

Sigmund Freud considers **emotional imbalance** as the main factor in the causation of crime.

> **Mentally and emotionally defective people are more prone to crime than persons who are emotionally stable.**

---

### Three-Point Structure of Human Personality

Freud postulated a **3-point structure for human personality:**

#### 1. The Id

**Nature:** Primitive part of people's mental makeup, present at birth

**Represents:** Unconscious biological drives such as:
- Food
- Water
- Air
- Sleep

---

#### 2. The Ego

**Nature:** That part of personality that compensates for the demands of the Id

**Function:**
- Helps people guide their actions
- Remain within boundaries of social convention
- Considers what is practical and conventional by societal standards

---

#### 3. The Super Ego

**Nature:** The force of self-criticism and conscience

**Development:** Super ego develops when an individual internalizes the moral standards and values of parents and community

---

## 📊 **Contribution of Psychoanalytical Theory**

### Personality-Crime Connection

Psychiatrists maintain that **criminal behaviour is very much connected to personality of the criminal**.

**Key Insight:**
> There is something **uncompromising in the personality** of criminals which compels that particular person to revolt against values and norms of society.

---

## 🎯 **Key Contributors and Their Theories**

### Alfred Adler (Founder of Individual Psychology)

**Main Contribution:**
> **Inferiority complex** is the main cause of crime.

---

### August Aichorn

**Most important causes of crime according to Aichorn:**

#### 1. Faulty Methods of Child Training

**Argument:**
> Parents are responsible to make the child criminal in **both cases**:
> - When parents have **no time to give love**, OR
> - When parents **give love too much** to the child

#### 2. Criminal Parents Influence

**A child having criminal parents:**
- Generally upset
- Therefore gets involved in crime commission itself

**Solution:** A child should be given proper treatment to make their life happy and provide them a pleasurable environment.

---

### Carl Jung

**Background:** Closest student of Sigmund Freud who developed **analytical psychology**

**Main Contribution:**
> An important aspect of human psychic structure is the **collective unconsciousness**.

---

## ✅ **Summary**

The psychoanalytical approach emphasizes:
- Personality disturbances as root cause of crime
- Early childhood experiences as critical
- Emotional and psychological factors over biological
- Id-Ego-Superego conflict in criminal behaviour
- Inferiority complex and faulty upbringing as criminogenic factors
