> **Focus**: Foundations, Schools, Criminal Psychology

---

---

## 🎯 **MODULE 01: ESSENTIALS**

### **Crime vs Criminal**

**Crime** = Act + Intent + Harm + Illegal + Punishable

**Criminal** = Person who commits crime / convicted

> 📌 **Exam Tip**: Always define both terms separately

---

### **Criminology**

**Definition**: Scientific study of crime, criminals, criminal behavior, and criminal justice system

**Scope**: Nature, causes, patterns, prevention, criminal justice

---

## 🏛️ **SCHOOLS - QUICK COMPARISON**

| School | Time | Key Idea | Punishment | Example |
|--------|------|----------|------------|---------|
| **Pre-Classical** | Pre-1700s | Supernatural | Cruel, arbitrary | Trial by ordeal |
| **Classical** | 1764+ | Free will, rationality | Proportionate, deterrent | Beccaria's reforms |
| **Neo-Classical** | Late 1700s | Modified free will | Flexible (age, insanity) | Judicial discretion |
| **Positivist** | 1870s+ | Scientific determinism | Treatment, rehabilitation | Lombroso's stigmata |

---

### **Classical School - MUST KNOW**

**Founders**: Beccaria (1764) & Bentham

**Core Principles**:
1. Free will - humans choose rationally
2. Hedonistic calculus - pleasure vs pain
3. Punishment as deterrent
4. Proportionate, certain, swift, public

**Reforms**: Abolish torture, end capital punishment, proportionality

> 🧠 **Mnemonic "FREE"**: Free will, Rational choice, Equal punishment, Everyone equal before law

---

### **Neo-Classical Additions**

**Key Modifications**:
- Mental state matters
- Age considerations (children different)
- Mitigating circumstances
- Judicial discretion

> ⚠️ **Don't confuse**: Classical = Fixed punishment, Neo-Classical = Flexible

---

## 🔬 **POSITIVIST APPROACH**

### **Radical vs Liberal**

**Radical (Italian School)**:
- Biological determinism
- Born criminals
- Lombroso, Ferri, Garofalo

**Liberal (French School)**:
- Social factors dominant
- Environment matters
- Gabriel Tarde

---

### **THE BIG FOUR POSITIVISTS**

#### **1. LOMBROSO - "Born Criminal"**

**Theory**: Atavism - evolutionary throwbacks

**Physical Stigmata** (list 5-6 for exam):
- Sloping forehead
- Large jaw
- Long arms
- Small eyes
- Large ears
- Asymmetrical face

**Types**: Born criminals, Insane, Criminaloids, Passionate

**Criticism**: Unscientific, ignores social factors, stigmatizing

---

#### **2. FERRI - "Multiple Factors"**

**Three Causes** (PAS):
- **P**hysical (climate, geography)
- **A**nthropological (age, sex, heredity)
- **S**ocial (economy, education, family)

**Law of Criminal Saturation**: Every society has crime level based on conditions

**5 Types of Criminals**: Born, Insane, Habitual, Occasional, Passionate

**Penal Substitutes**: Social reforms instead of punishment (free trade, cheap housing, street lighting)

---

#### **3. GAROFALO - "Natural Crime"**

**Theory**: Crime violates two moral sentiments:
1. **Pity** (respect for life)
2. **Probity** (respect for property)

**4 Types**: Murderers, Violent, Deficient in probity, Lascivious

**Punishment**: HARSH - Elimination, Life imprisonment, Reparation

> ⚠️ **Remember**: Garofalo most HARSH of positivists

---

#### **4. TARDE - "Imitation"**

**Three Laws of Imitation**:

1. **Close Contact**: Imitate those near us
2. **Superior by Inferior**: Lower class imitates upper
3. **Insertion**: New patterns replace old

**Key**: Crime is SOCIAL, not BIOLOGICAL (opposed Lombroso)

> 📌 **Link**: Tarde → Sutherland (Module 07) - both emphasize social learning

---

### **Comparison Table - Memorize This**

| Theorist | Key Theory | Focus | Famous For |
|----------|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Lombroso** | Atavism | Biology | Physical stigmata, born criminal |
| **Ferri** | Multiple factors | Sociology | 3 causes (PAS), 5 types, criminal saturation |
| **Garofalo** | Natural crime | Law/Morality | Pity + Probity, harsh punishment |
| **Tarde** | Imitation | Social learning | 3 laws of imitation, opposed Lombroso |

---

## 📅 **DAY 2: MODULE 02**

### ⏰ **Study Schedule**

- **Morning (3 hours)**: Criminal psychology basics, approaches
- **Afternoon (2 hours)**: Criminal behavior, causes
- **Evening (2 hours)**: Mental illness, aggression

---

## 🧠 **CRIMINAL PSYCHOLOGY - CORE**

### **Definition**

Study of mind, mental processes, motivational patterns, and behavior of criminals

**Purpose**: Find cause, understand reactions, assist legal system

**Roles**: Research, treatment, assessment, expert testimony, profiling

**Scope**: "Where there is behavior, there is psychology" - very wide

---

## 🎭 **THREE APPROACHES - COMPARISON**

| Approach | Focus | Key Figures | Main Ideas |
|----------|-------|-------------|------------|
| **Psychoanalytical** | Unconscious mind | Freud, Adler, Jung, Aichorn | Id-Ego-Superego, childhood, personality |
| **Psychological** | Observable behavior | Watson, Skinner | Learning, conditioning, testing |
| **Behaviourist** | Group patterns | Social learning theorists | Common behavior, cooperation, environment |

---

## 🧠 **FREUD'S THEORY - EXAM ESSENTIAL**

### **Three Personality Structures (IES)**

**ID** → Pleasure Principle
- Present at birth
- Unconscious biological drives
- Food, water, sex, sleep
- **"I want it NOW!"**

**EGO** → Reality Principle
- Develops later
- Mediates Id and reality
- Practical, conventional
- **"Let's be realistic"**

**SUPEREGO** → Morality Principle
- Develops through socialization
- Conscience, moral standards
- Parents' and society's values
- **"That's wrong!"**

---

### **Crime = Imbalance**

- **Overdeveloped Id** + Weak Ego/Superego = Impulsive crimes
- **Underdeveloped Superego** = No guilt = Psychopathy
- **Overdeveloped Superego** = Excessive guilt = Crime for punishment

> **Freud's Conclusion**: Criminal = Aggressive, frustrated, dominated by childhood events

---

## 👥 **OTHER PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORISTS**

### **Quick Reference**

**Alfred Adler**: 
- **Inferiority complex** causes crime
- Physical defects, appearance, low status → Crime

**August Aichorn**:
- **Faulty child training** causes crime
- BOTH neglect AND over-indulgence harmful

**Carl Jung**:
- **Collective unconscious**
- Shared human psychological patterns

---

### **Two Categories of Psychosis**

1. **Organic**: Loss of memory, degeneration, physical cause
2. **Functional**: Mental conflict, psychological cause

---

## 🔑 **CRIMINAL BEHAVIOUR - 4 DEFINITIONS**

Must mention ALL FOUR in exam:

1. **Legal**: Prohibited by law, punished by state
2. **Moral**: Violates moral/religious code
3. **Social**: Violates social norms, community punishment
4. **Psychological**: Causes psychological stress to victim

> **Comprehensive**: Anti-social behavior punishable by law or community norms

---

## 📋 **6 CAUSES OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOUR**

> 🧠 **Mnemonic "FAMILY"**:
> - **F**inancial problems
> - **A**nti-social values
> - **M**ental illness
> - **I**nferiority (low social status)
> - **L**ow self-control
> - **Y**oung age (family background)

**Explain each briefly with example for 10 marks**
