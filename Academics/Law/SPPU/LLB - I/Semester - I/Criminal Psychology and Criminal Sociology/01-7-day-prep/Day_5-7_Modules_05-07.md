# 📖 7-DAY PREP: Days 5-7

## Modules 05-07: Sociological Theories (Structure, Subculture, Process)

> **Focus**: Social Structure, Subcultural, Social Process Theories

---

## 📅 **DAY 5: MODULE 05**

### ⏰ **Study Schedule**

- **Morning (3 hours)**: Social structure, Social disorganization
- **Afternoon (3 hours)**: Merton's strain theory
- **Evening (1 hour)**: Agnew's general strain, revision

---

## 🏗️ **SOCIAL STRUCTURE THEORY - FOUNDATION**

### **Core Premise**

> Crime caused by **disadvantaged economic class position**

**Shift**: From individual factors → Social factors

**Focus**: Lower class, poverty, blocked opportunities

---

## 🏚️ **SOCIAL DISORGANIZATION THEORY**

### **Chicago School (1920s-30s)**

**Key Figures**: Park, Burgess, Shaw, McKay

---

### **Concentric Zone Model**

```
Zone I: Central Business District
Zone II: TRANSITION ZONE ← HIGHEST CRIME ⚠️
Zone III: Working Men's Homes
Zone IV: Residential (middle class)
Zone V: Commuter (suburbs)
```

> 📌 **CRITICAL FINDING**: Crime rates highest in **Zone II** and **remained high** even as ethnic groups changed

**Implication**: Area characteristics (not ethnicity) cause crime

---

### **Characteristics of Zone II**

**PREP mnemonic**:
- **P**overty (high)
- **R**esidential instability (high turnover)
- **E**thnic heterogeneity (many groups)
- **P**opulation (transient)

**Result**: **Social Disorganization** → Weak social control → High crime

---

### **Social Disorganization Defined**

> Inability of community to regulate itself according to common values and realize common goals

**Weakens**:
- Informal social control
- Community bonds
- Collective efficacy

---

### **Collective Efficacy (Modern)**

**Sampson & Raudenbush**:

> Collective Efficacy = Social cohesion + Willingness to intervene

**Finding**: High collective efficacy → Low crime (even if poverty exists)

---

### **Policy Implications**

1. Increase stability (home ownership)
2. Strengthen community (organizations, programs)
3. Improve environment (lighting, repairs)
4. Empower residents (community policing)

---

## 🎯 **MERTON'S STRAIN THEORY - EXAM CRITICAL**

### **Background**

**Robert Merton (1938)**: Adapted Durkheim's anomie

**Durkheim's Anomie**: Normlessness, breakdown of social norms

**Merton's Strain**: Gap between cultural goals and institutionalized means

---

### **Core Components**

**Cultural Goals**: Society says "Be successful! Get rich!" (American Dream)

**Institutionalized Means**: Education, hard work, career (legitimate paths)

**Problem**: Society emphasizes goals for ALL, but doesn't provide means for ALL

**Result**: **STRAIN** (pressure, frustration)

---

### **FIVE MODES OF ADAPTATION - ABSOLUTELY MUST KNOW**

> 🧠 **Mnemonic "C-I-R-R-R"** or **"CIRRR"**

| Mode | Goals | Means | Symbol | Explanation | Example |
|------|-------|-------|--------|-------------|---------|
| **1. Conformity** | ✅ Accept | ✅ Accept | ++ | Accept goals, use legitimate means | Hard work, education |
| **2. Innovation** | ✅ Accept | ❌ Reject | +- | Accept goals, use illegitimate means | **CRIME** - theft, fraud |
| **3. Ritualism** | ❌ Reject | ✅ Accept | -+ | Lower goals, follow rules | Low-ambition worker |
| **4. Retreatism** | ❌ Reject | ❌ Reject | -- | Reject both, withdraw | Drug addicts, homeless |
| **5. Rebellion** | 🔄 Replace | 🔄 Replace | ±± | Replace with new goals/means | Revolutionaries |

---

### **Innovation = CRIME (Most Important)**

**Why Innovation?**:
- Want success (cultural goal)
- Blocked from legitimate means (poverty, no education)
- Use crime to achieve goals (innovation)

**Types**:
- **Lower class**: Street crime (theft, drugs)
- **Middle/Upper class**: White-collar crime (fraud, embezzlement)

> 📌 **Exam Essential**: Innovation explains BOTH street crime AND white-collar crime

---

### **Why Not All Poor Commit Crime?**

1. Most choose **Conformity** (even if difficult)
2. **Individual differences** (self-control, values)
3. **Relative deprivation** matters (not absolute poverty)
4. Other adaptations available (ritualism, retreatism)

---

### **Agnew's General Strain (1992) - Brief**

**Expanded Strain Beyond Economic**:

**Three Types of Strain**:
1. **Failure** to achieve goals (Merton's strain)
2. **Loss** of positive stimuli (death, breakup, job loss)
3. **Negative stimuli** (abuse, bullying, victimization)

**All create anger/frustration → May lead to crime**

**Not all strain = crime**: Depends on coping strategies

---

## 📅 **DAY 6: MODULE 06**

### ⏰ **Study Schedule**

- **Morning (2 hours)**: Cohen's theory
- **Afternoon (2 hours)**: Miller's theory
- **Evening (2 hours)**: Comparison, revision

---

## 👥 **SUBCULTURAL THEORIES - OVERVIEW**

### **Core Premise**

> Youth commit crime because they are **CONFORMING to subcultural values** (which differ from mainstream)

**Key**: Crime is collective, group behavior

---

## 📘 **COHEN'S DELINQUENT SUBCULTURE (1955)**

### **Research Question**

Why do lower-class boys form gangs that commit **non-utilitarian crime** (vandalism, fighting)?

---

### **Process**

```
Lower-Class Boys + Middle-Class School
        ↓
Middle-Class Measuring Rod (judged by MC standards)
        ↓
Cannot Meet Standards (lack skills, values)
        ↓
FAILURE + HUMILIATION
        ↓
STATUS FRUSTRATION
        ↓
Form Gangs with Similar Boys
        ↓
REACTION FORMATION (Invert MC values)
        ↓
Delinquent Subculture (MC values → opposite)
        ↓
Non-Utilitarian, Malicious Crime
```

---

### **Middle-Class Measuring Rod**

**MC Values in School**:
- Ambition, achievement
- Self-reliance
- Respect for property
- Academic skills
- Verbal skills
- Manners, non-violence

**Lower-Class Reality**:
- Live in present
- Collective orientation
- Lack possessions
- Poor preparation
- Limited vocabulary
- Toughness valued

**Result**: Lower-class boys FAIL in school

---

### **Reaction Formation**

> Overreaction in opposite direction to what frustrates you

**MC values frustrate → Invert those values**:
- Respect property → Destroy property
- Study → Reject education
- Be polite → Be disrespectful

---

### **Characteristics (6)**

1. **Non-Utilitarian** - Not for money
2. **Malicious** - Spiteful, aimed at MC
3. **Negativistic** - Opposite of MC values
4. **Versatile** - Variety of acts
5. **Short-Run Hedonism** - Immediate pleasure
6. **Group Autonomy** - Loyalty to gang, anti-authority

---

## 🎭 **MILLER'S LOWER-CLASS CULTURE (1958)**

### **Core Argument**

**Differs from Cohen**:

**Cohen**: Lower class WANTS MC success (can't achieve) → REACTIVE

**Miller**: Lower class HAS OWN distinct culture → PROACTIVE

**Miller**: Delinquency = Normal expression of lower-class values, NOT reaction to MC

---

### **SIX FOCAL CONCERNS - CRITICAL**

> 🧠 **"T-S-S-E-F-A"** or **"TT-SEAM"** or **"2T-SEAF"**

#### **1. TROUBLE**
- Getting into and out of trouble
- Ambivalent (bad but brings status)

#### **2. TOUGHNESS**
- Physical prowess, masculinity, bravery
- Prove manhood (female-headed households)

#### **3. SMARTNESS**
- Street smarts, not academic
- Con, hustle, outwit

#### **4. EXCITEMENT**
- Seek thrills, avoid boredom
- Gambling, drinking, risk

#### **5. FATE**
- Life controlled by luck
- External locus of control
- "What will be, will be"

#### **6. AUTONOMY**
- Freedom from authority
- Resent control
- (But unconsciously need structure)

---

### **Delinquency as Normal Expression**

**Miller's View**:
- Boys express focal concerns
- Fighting = Toughness
- Hustling = Smartness
- Joyriding = Excitement
- Defying police = Autonomy

**NOT reactive** - Just following their culture

---

## 📊 **COHEN VS MILLER - EXAM COMPARISON**

| Aspect | Cohen | Miller |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **LC Culture** | Same goals as MC | Different, autonomous |
| **Cause** | Status frustration | LC cultural values |
| **Delinquency** | REACTIVE (against MC) | PROACTIVE (following LC) |
| **Crime Type** | Non-utilitarian, malicious | Express focal concerns |
| **Tone** | LC wants MC success | LC has own values |

> 📌 **Key Distinction**: Cohen = REACTION, Miller = EXPRESSION

---

## 📅 **DAY 7: MODULE 07**

### ⏰ **Study Schedule**

- **Morning (2 hours)**: Differential Association, Reinforcement
- **Afternoon (2 hours)**: Neutralization, Social Bond
- **Evening (2 hours)**: Labelling, Self-Control, final revision

---

## 👥 **DIFFERENTIAL ASSOCIATION - SUTHERLAND**

### **Core Idea**

> **Criminal behavior is LEARNED** in intimate groups through communication

---

### **9 Propositions - LIST FORMAT (Exam)**

1. Crime is **learned** (not inherited)
2. Learned through **communication**
3. In **intimate personal groups** (family, friends)
4. Learn **techniques** + **attitudes**
5. Learn **definitions** (favorable/unfavorable to law)
6. **EXCESS of favorable definitions** → Crime (KEY PROPOSITION)
7. Associations vary in **FDPI** (Frequency, Duration, Priority, Intensity)
8. All **learning mechanisms** involved
9. Same **needs** as non-criminal (need doesn't explain crime)

> 📌 **Most Important**: Proposition 6 - Excess of favorable definitions

---

### **FDPI Dimensions**

- **F**requency: How often
- **D**uration: How long
- **P**riority: How early (childhood most important)
- **I**ntensity: How important the source (family > strangers)

---

## 🎁 **DIFFERENTIAL REINFORCEMENT - AKERS**

**Addition to Sutherland**:

> Adds **operant conditioning** (B.F. Skinner)

**Key**: Behavior shaped by **consequences**

**If crime is rewarded** → Repeat
**If crime is punished** → Stop

**Balance**: Rewards > Costs → Continue crime

---

## 🌊 **NEUTRALIZATION - SYKES & MATZA**

### **5 Techniques - ABSOLUTELY MEMORIZE**

> 🧠 **"3D-CA"** or **"D-D-D-C-A"**

1. **Denial of RESPONSIBILITY**: "Not my fault, I was drunk, friends made me"
2. **Denial of INJURY**: "Nobody really hurt, they have insurance"
3. **Denial of VICTIM**: "They deserved it, had it coming"
4. **CONDEMNATION of condemners**: "Everyone corrupt, who are they to judge?"
5. **APPEAL to higher loyalties**: "Had to do it for my gang/family"

> 📌 **Used BEFORE crime** to overcome guilt, not just excuses after

---

### **Drift Theory**

**Key Concept**: Youth **drift** between conventional and criminal worlds

- NOT fully committed to either
- Neutralizations allow temporary drift into crime
- Eventually drift OUT (age out)

---

## 🔗 **SOCIAL BOND THEORY - HIRSCHI**

### **The Question**

**Others ask**: Why do people commit crime?

**Hirschi asks**: **Why DON'T people commit crime?**

**Answer**: Strong **social bonds** prevent crime

---

### **4 Elements of Social Bond**

> 🧠 **"A-CAB"** or **"A-C-I-B"**

#### **1. ATTACHMENT**
- Emotional bond to others
- Care about their opinions
- Don't want to disappoint
- **Most important**: Parental attachment

#### **2. COMMITMENT**
- Investment in conventional life
- Education, career, reputation
- Too much to lose
- Rational stake in conformity

#### **3. INVOLVEMENT**
- Time in conventional activities
- Busy schedule
- No time for crime
- "Idle hands are devil's workshop"

#### **4. BELIEF**
- Acceptance of moral code
- Belief in legitimacy of law
- Respect for authority
- Crime is wrong

---

### **How Bonds Prevent Crime**

**ALL FOUR STRONG** → Conformity

**ANY WEAK** → Free to commit crime

```
Attachment → Don't hurt loved ones
Commitment → Too much to lose
Involvement → No time
Belief → Crime is wrong
     ↓
CONFORMITY
```

> 📌 **Exam**: Always explain ALL FOUR elements

---

## 🏷️ **LABELLING THEORY - BECKER**

### **Fundamental Shift**

**Old Question**: Why do people commit crime?

**New Question**: How are acts and people **labeled** as criminal?

---

### **Core Propositions**

1. **Deviance not inherent** - Socially constructed
2. **Labeling creates deviance** - Self-fulfilling prophecy
3. **Power matters** - Who has power to label

---

### **Primary vs Secondary Deviance**

| Aspect | Primary Deviance | Secondary Deviance |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Definition** | Initial rule-breaking | Deviance as lifestyle/identity |
| **Identity** | Not central to self | Master status |
| **Frequency** | Occasional | Repeated |
| **Cause** | Various reasons | Result of labeling |
| **Outcome** | May stop if not labeled | Criminal career |

---

### **Process**

```
Minor rule-breaking (Primary)
        ↓
    CAUGHT & LABELED
        ↓
    Master Status ("criminal")
        ↓
    Treated as deviant
        ↓
    Internalize label
        ↓
    Secondary Deviance
        ↓
    Criminal Career
```

**Self-Fulfilling Prophecy**: Label creates reality

**Example**: Labeled "criminal" → Can't get job → Poverty → More crime

---

### **Policy**

**Radical Non-Intervention**: "Leave kids alone wherever possible"
- Diversion programs
- Avoid labeling
- Decriminalization
- Reintegrative shaming (shame act, not person)
- Restorative justice

---

## 💪 **SELF-CONTROL THEORY - GOTTFREDSON & HIRSCHI**

### **Core Argument**

> **Low self-control** = Single best predictor of crime

---

### **Low Self-Control Characteristics**

> 🧠 **"CRISTA"** or list 6 traits:

1. **I**mpulsivity (act without thinking)
2. **S**imple tasks preference (avoid complex)
3. **R**isk-seeking (thrill-seeking)
4. **P**hysical (rather than mental activities)
5. **S**elf-centered (lack empathy)
6. **T**emper (low frustration tolerance)

---

### **Origin**

**Established by age 10** (childhood):

**Good parenting** → High self-control → Conformity
**Poor parenting** → Low self-control → Crime

**Stable throughout life** (doesn't change much)

---

### **Why Crime?**

Crime = Immediate gratification + Low effort + Excitement

**Perfect fit for person with low self-control!**

---

### **Policy**

**Early intervention** (before age 10):
- Parent training
- Head Start programs
- Self-control education

**Later interventions less effective** (already established)

---

## 💭 **SELF-ESTEEM & CRIME - BRIEF**

**Complex relationship**:
- Low self-esteem may → Crime (compensate)
- High self-esteem (threatened) may → Violence (defend ego)

**Mixed research results**

---

## 📊 **COMPARISON OF ALL MODULE 07 THEORIES**

| Theory | Key Figure | Core Idea | Policy |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Differential Association** | Sutherland | Crime is learned | Change associations |
| **Differential Reinforcement** | Akers | Crime is reinforced | Change consequences |
| **Neutralization** | Sykes & Matza | Youth drift, use excuses | Challenge rationalizations |
| **Social Bond** | Hirschi | Weak bonds → Crime | Strengthen bonds (A-CAB) |
| **Labelling** | Becker | Labels create deviance | Avoid labeling, diversion |
| **Self-Control** | Gottfredson & Hirschi | Low SC → Crime | Early intervention |
