## 👥 **SOCIALIZATION AND CRIME - DIFFERENTIAL ASSOCIATION THEORY**

### **Edwin H. Sutherland (1883-1950)**

**Background:**
- American sociologist
- "Dean of American Criminology"
- Book: **"Principles of Criminology"** (1939)

**Major Contribution:**
- Differential Association Theory
- Theory of white-collar crime

---

### **Core Proposition**

> **Criminal behavior is LEARNED** through interaction with others in a process of communication.

**Key Insight:**
- Crime is NOT inherited (biological)
- Crime is NOT instinctive
- Crime is **LEARNED** like any other behavior

---

### **The Nine Propositions**

#### **Proposition 1:**

> "Criminal behavior is learned."

- Not inherited
- Not biological
- Learned through experience

---

#### **Proposition 2:**

> "Criminal behavior is learned in interaction with other persons in a process of communication."

**Communication includes:**
- Verbal (talking)
- Non-verbal (gestures, actions)
- Direct instruction
- Observation

---

#### **Proposition 3:**

> "The principal part of learning criminal behavior occurs within **intimate personal groups**."

**Most Important Learning From:**
- Family
- Close friends
- Gang members
- Intimate associates

**Less Important:**
- Media (movies, TV)
- Impersonal agencies

> 📌 **Key Point**: Face-to-face contact in intimate groups is crucial.

---

#### **Proposition 4:**

> "When criminal behavior is learned, the learning includes:
> (a) **Techniques** of committing the crime
> (b) **Motives, drives, rationalizations, and attitudes**"

**Two Things Learned:**

**a) Techniques (HOW):**
- How to pick a lock
- How to hot-wire a car
- How to crack a safe
- How to forge documents

**b) Attitudes (WHY):**
- Justifications for crime
- Rationalizations
- "Why it's okay to steal"
- Favorable attitudes toward crime

---

#### **Proposition 5:**

> "The specific direction of motives and drives is learned from **definitions** of legal codes as **favorable** or **unfavorable**."

**Definitions:**
- Attitudes toward law
- View of legal codes

**Two Types:**

**Definitions Favorable to Violation:**
- "Rich people deserve to be stolen from"
- "Insurance companies can afford it"
- "Government is corrupt anyway"
- "Snitches get stitches"

**Definitions Unfavorable to Violation:**
- "Crime is wrong"
- "Stealing hurts people"
- "Law must be obeyed"
- "Honesty is important"

---

#### **Proposition 6: THE PRINCIPLE OF DIFFERENTIAL ASSOCIATION**

> "A person becomes delinquent because of an **excess of definitions favorable** to violation of law over definitions unfavorable to violation of law."

**This is the CORE of the theory!**

---

**Explanation:**

Think of it like a **mental balance scale**:

```
    Definitions FAVORABLE        Definitions UNFAVORABLE
      to crime                       to crime
    _______________              _______________
   |               |            |               |
   |  "Crime OK"   |            |  "Crime Bad"  |
   |               |            |               |
   |_______________|            |_______________|
          |                            |
          |_____________⚖️_____________|
                        |
                        ⬇️
            If LEFT side heavier:
                  CRIME
```

**If exposed to MORE pro-crime definitions than anti-crime:**
- Person will commit crime

**If exposed to MORE anti-crime definitions:**
- Person will NOT commit crime

---

#### **Proposition 7:**

> "Differential associations may vary in **frequency, duration, priority, and intensity**."

**Four Dimensions:**

##### **a) Frequency**
- How often exposed to definitions
- More exposure → Stronger influence

##### **b) Duration**
- How long the exposure
- Long-term relationships → Stronger influence

##### **c) Priority**
- How early in life
- **Childhood exposures most important**
- First learned = Strongest impact

##### **d) Intensity**
- Importance of source
- **Close relationships** (family, best friend) → Stronger
- Distant sources → Weaker

---

**Example:**

**High Criminal Influence:**
- **Frequent**: See criminal friends daily
- **Duration**: Friends for years
- **Priority**: Learned from father since childhood
- **Intensity**: Father and best friend (very important people)

**Result:** Likely to commit crime

---

#### **Proposition 8:**

> "The process of learning criminal behavior involves all mechanisms involved in any other learning."

- Classical conditioning
- Operant conditioning
- Observational learning
- Same as learning any skill

**Implication:** Criminal behavior is learned like:
- Learning to ride bicycle
- Learning language
- Learning profession

---

#### **Proposition 9:**

> "Criminal behavior is an expression of general needs and values, but NOT explained by those needs and values since non-criminal behavior expresses the same needs and values."

**Explanation:**

Everyone has needs:
- Need for money
- Need for status
- Need for excitement

**But:**
- Some fulfill needs through crime
- Some fulfill needs through legitimate means
- Need itself doesn't explain crime
- **Learning determines the METHOD**

---

### **Visual Summary of Differential Association**

```
PERSON
   ↓
Exposed to DEFINITIONS
   ↓
   ├─→ Favorable to crime (from criminals)
   |
   └─→ Unfavorable to crime (from law-abiding)
   ↓
RATIO determines behavior
   ↓
If Favorable > Unfavorable
   ↓
CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR
```

---

### **Policy Implications**

**Based on DA Theory:**

1. **Prevent Association with Criminals**
   - Break up gangs
   - Separate delinquents
   - Avoid sending juveniles to adult prisons (criminal university)

2. **Increase Association with Pro-Social Persons**
   - Mentorship programs
   - Positive role models
   - Community involvement

3. **Change Definitions**
   - Education programs
   - Moral education
   - Challenge pro-crime rationalizations

4. **Family Programs**
   - Strengthen families (primary socialization)
   - Parenting education
   - Early intervention

---

### **Criticism of Differential Association**

> ⚠️ **Limitations**

1. **Difficult to Test**
   - How to measure "excess of definitions"?
   - Subjective and vague
   - Hard to quantify

2. **Doesn't Explain First Criminal**
   - If crime is learned, who was the first criminal?
   - Who taught the first person?

3. **Ignores Personality**
   - Two people, same associations
   - One commits crime, other doesn't
   - Individual differences matter

4. **Assumes Passive Learning**
   - People actively choose associations
   - Not just passive recipients

5. **Doesn't Explain All Crime**
   - Crimes of passion
   - Spontaneous crimes
   - Individual crimes (embezzlement)

6. **Tautological?**
   - Circular reasoning
   - "Why did he commit crime?" "Because he learned it"
   - "How do you know he learned it?" "Because he committed crime"

<a name="differential-reinforcement"></a>
## 🎁 **DIFFERENTIAL REINFORCEMENT THEORY**

### **Robert Burgess and Ronald Akers (1966)**

**Background:**
- Modernized Sutherland's theory
- Added **behavioral psychology** (B.F. Skinner)
- Combined sociology + psychology

---

### **Core Concept**

> Criminal behavior is learned through **operant conditioning** - behavior is shaped by its consequences.

---

### **Key Principles**

#### **1. Differential Association (Same as Sutherland)**

- Association with criminal vs non-criminal
- Learn definitions
- In intimate groups

---

#### **2. Definitions**

- Favorable or unfavorable to crime
- Learned from associates
- Rationalize or condemn crime

---

#### **3. Differential Reinforcement**

> **NEW ELEMENT**: Behavior is strengthened or weakened by its **consequences**.

**Two Types:**

##### **Positive Reinforcement**
- Behavior followed by reward
- Increases likelihood of repetition

**Examples:**
- Theft → Get money → Repeat theft
- Crime → Peer approval → Repeat crime
- Violence → Feel powerful → Repeat violence

##### **Negative Reinforcement**
- Behavior removes something unpleasant
- Increases likelihood of repetition

**Examples:**
- Crime → Escape poverty → Repeat crime
- Violence → Remove threat → Repeat violence

##### **Punishment**
- Behavior followed by negative consequence
- Decreases likelihood of repetition

**Examples:**
- Crime → Arrested → Less likely to repeat
- Theft → Lose friends → Less likely to repeat

##### **Extinction**
- Behavior not followed by expected reward
- Decreases over time

**Examples:**
- Crime → No money gained → Stop committing
- Shoplifting → Always caught → Give up

---

#### **4. Imitation**

- Observational learning (Bandura)
- Model behavior of others
- Especially if model is rewarded

**Process:**
1. Observe someone commit crime
2. See them rewarded (money, respect)
3. Imitate the behavior

---

### **The Learning Process**

```
PERSON
   ↓
Associates with others (differential association)
   ↓
Learns definitions (favorable/unfavorable)
   ↓
Tries behavior
   ↓
If REINFORCED (rewarded) → REPEAT
If PUNISHED → STOP
   ↓
Continued reinforcement
   ↓
CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR PATTERN
```

---

### **Balance of Reinforcements**

**Person continues crime when:**

$$\text{Rewards of Crime} > \text{Costs of Crime}$$

**Rewards:**
- Money
- Status
- Excitement
- Peer approval
- Material goods

**Costs:**
- Risk of arrest
- Punishment
- Guilt
- Loss of respect
- Family disappointment

---

### **Why Some Stop Crime**

**Reinforcement changes:**
- Get caught (punishment)
- Don't get expected reward (extinction)
- Find legitimate rewards better
- Associate with non-criminals
- Definitions change

---

### **Policy Implications**

**Based on Differential Reinforcement:**

1. **Increase Costs of Crime**
   - Certain and swift punishment
   - Make crime less rewarding

2. **Decrease Rewards**
   - Seize proceeds of crime
   - Remove peer approval
   - Challenge "cool" image of crime

3. **Increase Rewards of Legitimate Behavior**
   - Jobs, education
   - Recognition for achievement
   - Make legitimate success attractive

4. **Change Associations**
   - Same as Differential Association
   - Positive peer groups

5. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy**
   - Change definitions
   - Challenge rationalizations
   - Develop coping skills

---

### **Advantages Over Sutherland**

1. **More Specific**
   - Clear mechanisms (reinforcement)
   - Easier to measure

2. **Testable**
   - Can test reinforcement effects
   - Empirical support strong

3. **Explains Continuation**
   - Why people continue crime
   - Why some desist

4. **Treatment Applications**
   - Behavior modification programs
   - Change reinforcement patterns

<a name="neutralization-drift"></a>
## 🌊 **NEUTRALIZATION AND DRIFT THEORY**

### **Gresham Sykes and David Matza (1957)**

**Background:**
- American criminologists
- Article: **"Techniques of Neutralization"** (1957)
- Book (Matza): **"Delinquency and Drift"** (1964)

---

### **Challenge to Subcultural Theories**

**Sykes and Matza observed:**

1. **Most delinquents feel guilty**
   - Not completely rejecting conventional values
   - Show remorse after crimes
   - Respect law-abiding persons

2. **Delinquents admire law-abiding persons**
   - Don't want family members to be victims
   - Distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate targets

3. **Delinquency is episodic**
   - Not always criminal
   - Drift in and out of delinquency
   - Most age out of crime

**Conclusion:** Delinquents are NOT fully committed to deviant values.

---

### **Concept of Drift**

> **Drift** = Movement between conventional and criminal behavior; youth are neither fully committed to crime nor to convention.

**Metaphor:**
- Like drifting on a raft
- Move between criminal and non-criminal worlds
- Not firmly anchored in either

**Implication:**
- Youth can drift INTO crime
- But also drift OUT of crime
- Not hardened criminals

---

### **Subterranean Values**

**Matza's Concept:**

> **Subterranean Values** = Values existing beneath surface of conventional society that are similar to delinquent values.

**Examples in Mainstream Culture:**
- Seek excitement (adventure sports)
- Toughness (boxing, MMA)
- Disdain for work (leisure activities)
- Aggression (competitive sports)

**Point:**
- Delinquent values not totally different
- Exaggerations of values present in society
- Difference is degree and context, not kind

---

### **Techniques of Neutralization**

**Key Question:** If delinquents feel guilty, how do they commit crimes?

**Answer:** They **neutralize** guilt by using **rationalizations** or **excuses**.

---

> **Techniques of Neutralization** = Rationalizations used BEFORE committing crime to overcome guilt and justify behavior.

---

### **Five Techniques**

> 🧠 **Memory Hook - "D-D-D-C-A" or "3D-CA"**

---

#### **1. Denial of Responsibility**

> "It wasn't my fault. I had no choice."

**Claim:**
- External forces caused behavior
- No control over actions
- Not responsible

**Excuses:**
- "I was drunk"
- "My friends made me do it"
- "I came from bad family"
- "Society pushed me to it"
- "I had no choice"

**Effect:** Removes personal blame

---

#### **2. Denial of Injury**

> "Nobody really got hurt."

**Claim:**
- No real harm was done
- Victim can afford it
- Minor damage

**Excuses:**
- "The store has insurance"
- "He's rich, won't miss it"
- "It's just a car, not a person"
- "Nobody was physically hurt"
- "Vandalism is just property damage"

**Effect:** Minimizes seriousness of crime

---

#### **3. Denial of Victim**

> "They had it coming. They deserved it."

**Claim:**
- Victim deserved what happened
- Not really a victim
- Victim is wrongdoer

**Excuses:**
- "He insulted me, deserved beating"
- "Store owner is a cheat"
- "Rich people exploit poor"
- "Police harass us, so we can harass them"
- "She was dressed provocatively" (rape myth)

**Effect:** Victim becomes wrongdoer, offender becomes avenger

---

#### **4. Condemnation of the Condemners**

> "Everyone is corrupt. Who are they to judge me?"

**Claim:**
- Those who condemn are hypocrites
- Police, judges, society are corrupt
- Shift focus to condemners' faults

**Excuses:**
- "Police take bribes"
- "Politicians are criminals"
- "Rich people cheat on taxes"
- "Everyone does it"
- "Teachers are unfair"

**Effect:** Attack credibility of accusers, deflect blame

---

#### **5. Appeal to Higher Loyalties**

> "I had to do it for my family/gang/friends."

**Claim:**
- Violated law to satisfy higher obligation
- Loyalty to smaller group over society
- Sacrifice for loved ones

**Excuses:**
- "My gang needed me"
- "Had to help my family"
- "Protect my friend"
- "Loyalty to brother"
- "Family comes first"

**Effect:** Crime becomes noble sacrifice

---

### **How Neutralization Works**

**Before Crime:**

```
Person wants to commit crime
        ⬇️
But feels guilt (conventional values present)
        ⬇️
Uses Technique of Neutralization
        ⬇️
Guilt overcome temporarily
        ⬇️
Commits crime
        ⬇️
After crime, may feel guilt again
```

---

### **Key Insight**

> **Techniques used BEFORE crime**, not after as excuses (though may be used after too).

- Neutralizations enable crime
- Temporary release from moral constraints
- Allow person to maintain self-image as good person
- "I'm not a bad person, but circumstances required this"

---

### **Drift Theory**

**Matza's Argument:**

Most delinquents are in state of **drift**:

- **Not fully committed** to delinquency
- **Not fully committed** to convention
- Move between both worlds

**When Neutralization Successful:**
- Moral constraints temporarily lifted
- Person "drifts" into delinquency
- Commits crime

**When Neutralization Fails:**
- Moral constraints remain
- Person stays conventional

**Eventually:**
- Most youth "drift" out of crime
- As they age, mature
- Take on adult responsibilities
- Conventional values strengthen

---

### **Policy Implications**

**Based on Neutralization Theory:**

1. **Challenge Rationalizations**
   - Confront neutralization techniques
   - Show logical flaws
   - Create cognitive dissonance

2. **Strengthen Conventional Values**
   - Moral education
   - Emphasize harm to victims
   - Develop empathy

3. **Victim Awareness Programs**
   - Meet victims
   - Understand impact
   - Harder to deny injury/victim

4. **Accountability**
   - Take responsibility
   - Cannot blame others
   - Own your choices

5. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy**
   - Identify neutralizations
   - Develop alternatives
   - Challenge thinking errors

---

### **Criticism**

> ⚠️ **Limitations**

1. **Order Unclear**
   - Do neutralizations cause crime?
   - Or are they just excuses after crime?

2. **Assumes Conventional Values**
   - Theory assumes delinquents hold conventional values
   - What if they truly don't value law?

3. **Cannot Explain Committed Criminals**
   - Professional criminals
- Psychopaths
   - Those fully committed to crime

4. **Empirical Testing Difficult**
   - Hard to measure neutralizations
   - Timing hard to establish

---

<a name="hirsch-social-bond"></a>
## 🔗 **HIRSCH'S SOCIAL CONTROL/SOCIAL BOND THEORY**

### **Travis Hirschi (1935-2017)**

**Background:**
- American criminologist
- Book: **"Causes of Delinquency"** (1969)
- Most influential control theory

---

### **Fundamental Question**

**Most theories ask:** "Why do people commit crime?"

**Hirschi asks:** "**WHY DON'T people commit crime?**"

---

### **Core Argument**

> Human nature is selfish. Crime is tempting and easy. The real question is why people CONFORM, not why they deviate.

**Answer:** People conform when they have **strong social bonds** to society.

> When social bonds are weak or broken, people are FREE to commit crime.

---

### **Four Elements of Social Bond**

> 🧠 **Memory Hook - "A-C-I-B"** (or **"A-CAB"**)
> - **A**ttachment
> - **C**ommitment
> - **I**nvolvement
> - **B**elief

---

### **1. ATTACHMENT**

#### **Definition**

> Emotional bond to others; sensitivity to opinions of others.

**To Whom:**
- Parents
- Teachers
- Friends (prosocial)
- Spouse

---

#### **Importance**

**Strong Attachment:**
- Care about what they think
- Don't want to disappoint them
- Fear losing their respect
- **Result:** Conform to avoid hurting relationship

**Weak Attachment:**
- Don't care about others' opinions
- Nothing to lose
- No fear of disappointing anyone
- **Result:** Free to commit crime

---

#### **Parental Attachment Most Important**

**Indicators of Strong Attachment:**
- Close communication with parents
- Share activities
- Seek advice
- Value parents' opinions

**Research Finding:**
- Strong parental attachment → Low delinquency
- Weak attachment → High delinquency
- Stronger predictor than broken home

---

> 📌 **Key Insight**: NOT whether parents are present, but quality of attachment matters.

---

### **2. COMMITMENT**

#### **Definition**

> Investment in conventional activities; rational stake in conformity.

**What is at Stake:**
- Education
- Career
- Reputation
- Property
- Future prospects

---

#### **Rational Calculation**

**High Commitment:**
- Much to lose from crime
- Education investment
- Career prospects
- Good reputation
- **Result:** Too risky to commit crime

**Low Commitment:**
- Nothing invested
- No career prospects
- No reputation to lose
- **Result:** Nothing holding back from crime

---

**Example:**

**High Commitment:**
- Medical student in final year
- Years of education invested
- Future career at stake
- Will NOT risk crime

**Low Commitment:**
- School dropout
- No job prospects
- No plans for future
- Crime is lower risk (less to lose)

---

### **3. INVOLVEMENT**

#### **Definition**

> Time and energy spent in conventional activities.

**Principle:** 
> "Idle hands are devil's workshop"

---

#### **Time Available**

**High Involvement:**
- Busy with school, work, activities
- No time for crime
- Tired at end of day
- **Result:** No opportunity for delinquency

**Low Involvement:**
- Much free time
- Bored, idle
- Hanging out with nothing to do
- **Result:** Time and opportunity for crime

---

**Activities:**
- School
- Homework
- Part-time job
- Sports, hobbies
- Family activities
- Volunteer work

**Research:** Youth involved in activities commit less crime.

---

### **4. BELIEF**

#### **Definition**

> Acceptance of conventional moral code; belief that rules should be obeyed.

---

#### **Moral Validity of Law**

**Strong Belief:**
- Law is legitimate
- Rules should be obeyed
- Crime is morally wrong
- Respect for authority
- **Result:** Conform because it's right

**Weak Belief:**
- Law is not legitimate
- Rules are unjust
- Crime not necessarily wrong
- No respect for authority
- **Result:** Nothing stopping crime

---

**Key Point:**
- Not about fear of punishment
- About internalized morality
- Belief in rightness of law

---

### **How Social Bonds Prevent Crime**

```
STRONG BONDS
      ↓
Attachment → Don't want to hurt loved ones
      ↓
Commitment → Too much to lose
      ↓
Involvement → No time for crime
      ↓
Belief → Crime is wrong
      ↓
CONFORMITY
```

```
WEAK BONDS
      ↓
No attachment → Don't care about others
      ↓
No commitment → Nothing to lose
      ↓
No involvement → Free time
      ↓
No belief → Law not important
      ↓
FREE TO COMMIT CRIME
```

---

### **Empirical Support**

**Strong Research Support:**
- Attachment to parents → Less delinquency
- Commitment to education → Less crime
- Involvement in activities → Less delinquency
- Belief in rules → Less crime

**One of most tested and supported theories in criminology**

---

### **Policy Implications**

**Strengthen Social Bonds:**

**1. Strengthen Attachment**
- Family programs
- Parent-child bonding
- Mentorship
- Positive relationships

**2. Increase Commitment**
- Education opportunities
- Job training
- Career counseling
- Help youth invest in future

**3. Increase Involvement**
- After-school programs
- Sports leagues
- Arts programs
- Structured activities

**4. Strengthen Belief**
- Moral education
- Character development
- Legitimate authority
- Fair rules

---

### **Criticism**

> ⚠️ **Limitations**

1. **Causal Order Question**
   - Do weak bonds cause crime?
   - Or does crime weaken bonds?
   - Might be reciprocal

2. **Doesn't Explain Criminal Bonds**
   - What about attachment to criminal friends?
   - Commitment to criminal career?
   - Ignores criminal associations

3. **Tautological**
   - Weak bonds → Crime
   - How know bonds weak? → Person committed crime

4. **Ignores Motivation**
   - Why do people WANT to commit crime?
   - Assumes crime is naturally attractive
   - Doesn't explain individual differences in temptation

---

<a name="becker-labelling"></a>
## 🏷️ **BECKER'S LABELLING THEORY**

### **Howard Becker (1928-2023)**

**Background:**
- American sociologist
- Book: **"Outsiders: Studies in Sociology of Deviance"** (1963)
- Symbolic interactionist perspective

---

### **Fundamental Shift**

**Previous theories asked:** "Why do people commit crime?"

**Labelling theory asks:** "How and why are certain acts and people **labeled** as criminal?"

---

### **Core Propositions**

#### **1. Deviance is Not Inherent**

> No act is inherently deviant or criminal. Deviance is created by social groups that make rules and apply them to particular people.

**Meaning:**
- Crime is socially constructed
- What is criminal in one society may not be in another
- Definition changes over time

**Example:**
- Alcohol: Legal in most countries, criminal in Saudi Arabia
- Same-sex relations: Legal now in India (2018), was criminal before
- Marijuana: Legal in some US states, criminal in India

---

#### **2. Labelling Creates Deviance**

> **"Social groups create deviance by making rules whose infraction creates deviance, and by applying those rules to particular people and labeling them as outsiders."**

**Process:**
1. Society makes rules
2. Some people break rules
3. Society **labels** them as deviant
4. Label affects person's identity
5. Person may become more deviant

---

### **Primary vs Secondary Deviance**

#### **Primary Deviance (Edwin Lemert)**

> Initial rule-breaking behavior; minor, not part of person's identity.

**Characteristics:**
- First-time offense
- Experimental
- Not central to self-concept
- Most people commit primary deviance
- Easily rationalized
- Doesn't lead to criminal identity

**Examples:**
- Teenager shoplifts once
- Student cheats on exam
- Person lies on taxes

**Outcome:** If not caught/labeled → Stop and conform

---

#### **Secondary Deviance**

> Deviant behavior that becomes part of person's identity after being labeled; criminal role becomes master status.

**Process:**
```
Person commits primary deviance
        ⬇️
Caught and LABELED ("criminal," "delinquent")
        ⬇️
Society treats person as deviant
        ⬇️
Person internalizes label
        ⬇️
Self-identity changes ("I am a criminal")
        ⬇️
SECONDARY DEVIANCE
        ⬇️
Deviance becomes lifestyle
```

---

**Characteristics:**
- Repeated criminal behavior
- Crime becomes central to identity
- Adopt criminal lifestyle
- Join deviant groups
- Hard to stop

---

### **Master Status**

> **Master Status** = Label that overrides all other characteristics.

**Example:**
- Person is father, employee, volunteer
- Commits crime
- Gets labeled "criminal"
- "Criminal" becomes master status
- Other identities fade
- Everyone sees person as "criminal" first

**Consequence:**
- Treated according to label
- Hard to escape label
- Becomes self-fulfilling prophecy

---

### **The Labelling Process**

#### **Stage 1: Rule-Breaking**

- Many people break rules
- Not everyone caught

#### **Stage 2: Detection and Reaction**

- Some caught, some not
- Depends on:
  - Power (rich escape, poor caught)
  - Race, class
  - Visibility
  - Police practices

#### **Stage 3: Labelling**

- Formal: Arrest, conviction, imprisonment
- Informal: Reputation, gossip

#### **Stage 4: Status Degradation Ceremony**

- Public ceremony that changes identity
- Court proceedings
- Prison intake
- Strip identity, give criminal identity

#### **Stage 5: Acceptance of Label**

- Person begins to see self as criminal
- Others treat person as criminal
- Opportunities close
- Associate with other criminals

#### **Stage 6: Secondary Deviance**

- Crime becomes way of life
- Criminal career begins
- Hard to return to conventional life

---

### **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy**

> **Labeling becomes self-fulfilling**: If society treats someone as criminal, they become criminal.

**Mechanism:**

**Person labeled "criminal":**
- Employers won't hire → Cannot get job → Poverty → Crime
- School expels → No education → Limited opportunities → Crime
- Family rejects → No support → Join gang → More crime
- Police watch closely → More likely to be caught again → Repeat

**Result:** Label creates the reality it describes.

### **Who Gets Labeled?**

**Labelling theory emphasizes:**

> It's not just WHAT you do, but:
> - WHO you are
> - WHO catches you
> - WHO has power to label

---

**Factors Affecting Labelling:**

**1. Social Class**
- Poor more likely to be labeled
- Rich can afford lawyers, avoid label

**2. Race**
- Minorities more likely to be labeled
- Racial profiling

**3. Age**
- Youth more likely to be caught
- But also more likely to be forgiven

**4. Appearance**
- How person looks
- Dress, demeanor
- Stereotypes

**5. Context**
- Same act, different settings
- Fighting in bar vs fighting in boardroom

---

### **Deviance Amplification**

> **Deviance Amplification** = Process by which societal reaction increases deviant behavior.

**Spiral:**

```
Minor Deviance
      ↓
Societal Reaction (Label)
      ↓
Increased Deviance (reaction to label)
      ↓
Stronger Reaction
      ↓
More Deviance
      ↓
SPIRAL CONTINUES
```

**Example:**
- Youth caught shoplifting
- Labeled "thief", expelled from school
- Cannot get job (criminal record)
- Joins gang (only acceptance)
- Commits more serious crimes
- More labeling
- Becomes career criminal

---

### **Policy Implications**

**Based on Labelling Theory:**

#### **1. Radical Non-Intervention**

> "**Leave kids alone wherever possible**" (Schur)

- Avoid labeling
- Diversion programs
- Keep youth out of system
- Informal handling

#### **2. Decriminalization**

- Remove criminal labels for minor acts
- Victimless crimes
- Reduce scope of criminal law

#### **3. Deinstitutionalization**

- Avoid imprisonment when possible
- Community-based programs
- Reduce stigma

#### **4. Reintegrative Shaming (Braithwaite)**

- Shame the ACT, not the PERSON
- Maintain bonds
- Forgiveness and reintegration
- Don't permanently stigmatize

#### **5. Restorative Justice**

- Focus on repairing harm
- Not on labeling offender
- Victim-offender mediation
- Community involvement

#### **6. Sealing/Expunging Records**

- Remove criminal records after time
- Give second chance
- Reduce long-term stigma

---

### **Criticism**

> ⚠️ **Limitations**

1. **Ignores Primary Deviance**
   - Doesn't explain initial crime
   - Why did person break rule in first place?
   - Only explains secondary deviance

2. **Overstates Labeling Effect**
   - Not everyone labeled becomes career criminal
   - Many overcome labels
   - Resilience and agency ignored

3. **Romanticizes Deviance**
   - Criminals as victims of labeling
   - Minimizes harm they cause
   - Real victims ignored

4. **Empirical Support Mixed**
   - Some support for amplification
   - But not as universal as theory suggests

5. **Ignores Serious Crime**
   - Works better for minor deviance
   - Murder, rape not explained by labeling

## 💪 **SELF-CONTROL AND SELF-ESTEEM AS RELATED TO CRIME**

### **Self-Control Theory (Gottfredson and Hirschi, 1990)**

#### **Book**
- **"A General Theory of Crime"** (1990)

---

#### **Core Argument**

> **Low self-control** is the single best predictor of crime.

---

### **What is Self-Control?**

**Self-Control** = Ability to:
- Delay gratification
- Consider consequences
- Resist temptation
- Control impulses
- Plan for future

---

### **Characteristics of Low Self-Control**

> 🧠 **Memory Hook - "CRISTA"**

**1. I**mpulsivity
- Act without thinking
- Spontaneous
- No planning

**2. S**imple tasks preference
- Avoid complex tasks
- Want easy solutions
- No persistence

**3. R**isk-seeking
- Thrill-seeking
- Adventurous
- Reckless

**4. P**hysical (rather than mental)
- Prefer physical activities
- Not intellectual
- Action-oriented

**5. S**elf-centered
- Insensitive to others
- Lack empathy
- Self-interested

**6. T**emper
- Low frustration tolerance
- Quick to anger
- Poor emotional regulation

---

### **Origin of Self-Control**

**Developed in CHILDHOOD (before age 10):**

**Good Parenting → High Self-Control:**
- Monitor child's behavior
- Recognize deviant behavior
- Punish appropriately
- Consistent discipline
- Care about child

**Poor Parenting → Low Self-Control:**
- Don't monitor child
- Don't recognize deviance
- Don't punish or punish erratically
- Don't care about child
- Neglect or abuse

---

### **Self-Control and Crime**

**Low Self-Control → High Crime:**

**Why?**
- Crime provides immediate gratification
- Low effort required
- Exciting
- Few long-term benefits
- **Perfect fit for person with low self-control**

---

**Low self-control also leads to:**
- Poor academic performance
- Unemployment
- Unstable relationships
- Substance abuse
- Accidents
- Poor health

> 📌 **General Theory**: Low self-control explains not just crime, but all "analogous behaviors" (smoking, drinking, gambling).

---

### **Self-Control is Stable**

**Key Claim:**
- Self-control established by age 10
- Remains **stable** throughout life
- Doesn't change much after childhood

**Implication:**
- Early intervention crucial
- Later interventions less effective
- Prevention in childhood

---

### **Policy Implications**

**Based on Self-Control Theory:**

1. **Early Childhood Intervention**
   - Parent training programs
   - Home visits
   - Head Start programs
   - Before age 10

2. **Parenting Education**
   - Teach effective parenting
   - Monitoring and discipline
   - Consistency

3. **School Programs**
   - Self-control training
   - Character education
   - Delayed gratification exercises

4. **Recognize Limitations of Later Intervention**
   - Criminal justice comes too late
   - Rehabilitation limited
   - Focus on prevention

---

### **Criticism of Self-Control Theory**

> ⚠️ **Limitations**

1. **Tautological**
   - "Why did he commit crime?" "Low self-control"
   - "How do you know he has low self-control?" "He committed crime"
   - Circular reasoning

2. **Stability Overstated**
   - Self-control CAN change
   - Maturation, life events matter
   - Age-crime curve shows change

3. **Ignores Opportunity**
   - Need both low self-control AND opportunity
   - High self-control people in high-crime areas may offend

4. **Cultural Bias**
   - Western middle-class view of self-control
   - Different cultures value different traits

5. **Overly Simplistic**
   - One cause for all crime?
   - Ignores type of crime
   - White-collar criminals have high self-control

---

## 🪞 **SELF-ESTEEM AND CRIME**

### **Two Competing Hypotheses**

#### **Hypothesis 1: Low Self-Esteem → Crime**

**Argument:**
- People with low self-esteem feel inadequate
- Commit crime to:
  - Gain status
  - Feel powerful
  - Compensate for inadequacy

**Expected:** Criminals have lower self-esteem than non-criminals

---

#### **Hypothesis 2: High Self-Esteem → Crime**

**Argument:**
- People with high self-esteem feel entitled
- Inflated ego
- Narcissism
- Violence to defend ego when challenged

**Expected:** Violent criminals have higher self-esteem

---

### **Research Findings**

**Mixed Results:**

**Some Studies:**
- Delinquents have lower self-esteem
- Low self-esteem in childhood → Later crime

**Other Studies:**
- Violent offenders have high self-esteem
- Narcissism linked to aggression
- Threatened egotism → Violence

**Current Consensus:**
- Relationship is **complex**
- May depend on:
  - Type of crime
  - Type of self-esteem (stable vs unstable)
  - Other factors (narcissism)

---

### **Threatened Egotism (Baumeister)**

**Modern Theory:**

> Violence occurs when **high self-esteem** is **threatened** or **challenged**.

**Process:**
- Person has high self-image (possibly inflated)
- Someone challenges or insults
- Ego threatened
- Violence to restore ego

**Example:**
- Gang member insulted
- Must respond violently
- To maintain reputation

---

### **Self-Esteem vs Self-Control**

| Concept | Definition | Relation to Crime |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| **Self-Control** | Control impulses, delay gratification | Low SC → High crime (strong support) |
| **Self-Esteem** | Evaluation of self-worth | Complex relationship |

## 📦 **Quick Reference Cards**

### **Card 1: Sutherland's 9 Propositions**

```
1. Crime is LEARNED
2. Learned through COMMUNICATION
3. In INTIMATE GROUPS (family, friends)
4. Learn TECHNIQUES + ATTITUDES
5. Learn DEFINITIONS (favorable/unfavorable)
6. EXCESS of favorable definitions → Crime
7. Associations vary (FDPI)
8. All LEARNING mechanisms
9. Same NEEDS as non-criminal
```

---

### **Card 2: Neutralization Techniques (3D-CA)**

```
1. Denial of RESPONSIBILITY ("Not my fault")
2. Denial of INJURY ("No harm done")
3. Denial of VICTIM ("They deserved it")
4. CONDEMNATION of condemners ("They're worse")
5. APPEAL to higher loyalties ("For my gang")
```

---

### **Card 3: Social Bond (A-CAB)**

```
ATTACHMENT → Emotional bonds (Don't hurt them)
COMMITMENT → Investment (Too much to lose)
INVOLVEMENT → Busy schedule (No time)
BELIEF → Moral values (Crime is wrong)

ALL FOUR STRONG → Conformity
ANY WEAK → Risk of Crime
```

### **Card 4: Labelling Process**

```
Rule-Breaking (Primary Deviance)
         ↓
    CAUGHT & LABELED
