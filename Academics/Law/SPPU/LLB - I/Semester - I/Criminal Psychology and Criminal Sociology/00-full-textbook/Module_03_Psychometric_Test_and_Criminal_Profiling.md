## 🧪 **PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS TO MEASURE CRIMINAL BEHAVIOUR**

### **1. INTELLIGENCE TESTS**

#### **Purpose**
- Measure cognitive abilities
- IQ testing

#### **Common Tests**

**a) Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)**
- Most widely used IQ test
- Measures verbal and performance IQ
- Age-appropriate versions

**b) Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale**
- Classic IQ test
- Measures abstract thinking, problem-solving

---

#### **Relevance to Crime**

**Research Findings:**
- Lower IQ associated with certain crimes
- Poor judgment and decision-making
- Difficulty understanding consequences
- Easily influenced by others

> ⚠️ **Important**: Low IQ does NOT cause crime, but may be a risk factor when combined with other factors.

---

### **2. PERSONALITY TESTS**

#### **Purpose**
- Assess personality traits
- Identify antisocial tendencies

---

#### **a) Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)**

**Features:**
- 567 true/false questions
- Most widely used personality test
- Measures multiple dimensions

**Clinical Scales Relevant to Crime:**

| Scale | Measures | Criminal Relevance |
