<a name="psychological-vs-psychoanalytical"></a>
## 🧠 **PSYCHOLOGICAL VS PSYCHOANALYTICAL APPROACH**

### **Psychoanalytical Approach to Crime**

#### **Foundation**

Based on **psychoanalytic theory of Sigmund Freud**.

**Sigmund Freud:**
- Austrian neurologist
- Put light on crime from psychoanalytic view

---

#### **Core Argument**

> **Criminal behaviour originates primarily in the personalities of offenders** rather than in their biology or situation.

---

### **SIGMUND FREUD'S THEORY**

#### **Personality Definition**

**Personality** refers to reasonably stable patterns of behaviour, including:
- Thoughts
- Feelings
- Emotions

That distinguish people from one another and control a person's way of adapting to life experiences.

---

#### **Three-Point Structure of Human Personality**

> 🧠 **Memory Hook - "IES"**
> - **I**d - Primitive drives
> - **E**go - Reality principle
> - **S**uperego - Moral conscience

---

##### **1. The Id**

**Nature:** 
- Primitive part of personality
- Present at birth
- Unconscious

**Represents:** 
- Unconscious biological drives
- Food, water, air, sleep
- Sex drive
- Immediate gratification

**Principle:** **Pleasure Principle** - Seeks immediate satisfaction

---

##### **2. The Ego**

**Nature:**
- Develops after Id
- Conscious and unconscious
- Mediator

**Function:**
- Compensates for demands of Id
- Helps guide actions
- Remains within boundaries of social convention
- Considers what is practical and conventional

**Principle:** **Reality Principle** - Adapts Id's demands to reality

---

##### **3. The Superego**

**Nature:**
- Force of self-criticism and conscience
- Moral component of personality
- Develops through socialization

**Development:**
- Superego develops when individual internalizes moral standards
- Values of parents and community
- Social norms and ethics

**Function:**
- Controls Id's impulses
- Guides Ego toward moral behavior
- Creates guilt when violated

---

### **Psychoanalytic Explanation of Crime**

#### **Imbalance Theory**

Crime occurs due to **imbalance** between Id, Ego, and Superego:

**Scenario 1: Overdeveloped Id**
- Strong primitive urges
- Weak Ego cannot control
- Weak Superego provides no guilt
- **Result:** Impulsive, violent crimes

**Scenario 2: Underdeveloped Superego**
- No moral conscience
- No guilt feelings
- **Result:** Psychopathic behavior

**Scenario 3: Overdeveloped Superego**
- Excessive guilt
- Person commits crime to be punished
- **Result:** Crime as self-punishment

---

> **Freud's Summary**: The psychoanalytic model depicts the criminal offender as **an aggressive, frustrated person dominated by events that occurred early in childhood**.

---

### **Emotional Imbalance as Main Factor**

Sigmund Freud considers **emotional imbalance** as the main factor in causation of crime.

> **Mentally and emotionally defective people are more prone to crime than persons who are emotionally stable.**

---

## 👤 **OTHER PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORISTS**

### **1. ALFRED ADLER**

#### **Title**
- Founder of **Individual Psychology**

#### **Main Theory**

> **Inferiority Complex** is the main cause of crime.

---

#### **Explanation**

**Inferiority Complex develops due to:**
- Physical defects (deaf, dumb, deformed)
- Ugly appearance
- Dark complexion
- Social rejection
- Low social status

**Criminal Behavior Results From:**
- Feeling of being neglected
- Sense of being outcast
- Compensation for inadequacy
- Attempt to prove superiority

---

### **2. AUGUST AICHORN**

#### **Main Contribution**

Most important causes of crime according to Aichorn:

---

##### **1. Faulty Methods of Child Training**

> **Core Argument**: Parents are responsible for making the child criminal in **BOTH cases**:
> - When parents have **no time to give love** (Neglect), OR
> - When parents **give love too much** (Over-indulgence)

**Explanation:**

**Case A: Parental Neglect**
- Child feels unloved
- Develops antisocial tendencies
- Seeks attention through negative behavior
- Becomes criminal

**Case B: Over-Indulgence**
- Child becomes spoiled
- Cannot accept limits
- Expects everything immediately
- When denied, turns to crime

> 📌 **Key Point**: BOTH extremes are harmful - Balance is essential.

---

##### **2. Criminal Parents Influence**

**Effect:**
- Child with criminal parents generally upset
- Learns criminal behavior from parents
- Gets involved in crime commission

**Solution:**
> A child should be given proper treatment to make their life happy and provide them pleasurable environment.

---

### **3. CARL JUNG**

#### **Background**

#### **Main Contribution**

> An important aspect of human psychic structure is the **collective unconsciousness**.

**Collective Unconscious:**
- Shared memories of human race
- Inherited psychological patterns
- Archetypes common to all humans

- Feel neglected due to physical appearance
- Generate feeling of being outcast
- Irritation instigates criminal acts

---

## 📊 **PSYCHOANALYTIC VS PSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACH**

### **Comparison Table**

<a name="behaviourist-approach"></a>
## 🎯 **BEHAVIOURIST APPROACH TO CRIME**

### **Introduction**

Behavior System is a very important aspect in the study of crimes. The common element of **violation of law** is found in every crime.

> **Key Point**: No specific or definite reason can be regarded as the sole cause of crime, but crime spoils the whole peace and order of society.

---

### **Nature of Criminal Acts**

Criminal acts differ among themselves in the following aspects:

1. **Motives and characteristics** of offenders
2. **Characteristics of victims**
3. **Situation** in which crimes are committed
4. **Techniques** used for commission of crime
5. **Damages** resulting from crime
6. **Reaction** of victims and public
7. **Quantum of loss** suffered by victim

---

### **Behaviour System in Crime**

> **Core Principle**: All criminal activities depend upon the behaviour system in crime.

The behaviourist approach examines:
- How behaviour patterns facilitate crime
- How criminal behaviour is learned and reinforced
- How social and environmental factors shape criminal conduct
- How criminals coordinate and cooperate

---

## 📋 **CHARACTERISTICS OF BEHAVIOURIST APPROACH**

### **1. Individual or Group Participation**

A crime may be committed by:
- **Individual offender**, OR
- **Group of individuals** (directly or indirectly participating)

**Examples of group crimes:**
- Professional theft
- Drug trafficking
- Fraudulent advertising
- Organized crime

---

### **2. Common Behaviour Pattern**

The behaviour in a behaviour system is **not unique** to any particular individual:

> It operates in the same way in a large number of persons - it is **common behaviour**.

---

### **3. Joint Participation**

**Common and joint participation** in crime commission is the essential characteristic of the behaviourist approach towards crime.

---

### **4. Mutual Cooperation Among Criminals**

**Criminals get mutual cooperation from each other because of:**
- **Sentimental coordination** between them
- **Common desire** for commission of crime
- Shared goals and values
- Group solidarity

---

### **Key Differences from Psychoanalytic Approach**

| Feature | Psychoanalytic | Behaviourist |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| **Focus** | Individual unconscious | Observable group behavior |
| **Method** | Case studies | Observation of patterns |
| **Cause** | Internal conflicts | External reinforcement |
| **Social Factor** | Secondary | Primary |
| **Learning** | Not emphasized | Central concept |
