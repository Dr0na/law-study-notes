## 🏛️ **SCHOOLS OF CRIMINOLOGY**

### **1. THE PRE-CLASSICAL SCHOOL**

#### **Time Period**
- Before 18th century

#### **Key Features**

1. **Supernatural Explanation**
   - Crime was seen as result of supernatural forces
   - Belief in demonic possession
   - Divine punishment for sins

2. **Trial Methods**
   - **Trial by Ordeal**: Test by fire, water
   - **Trial by Combat**: Physical fight to determine guilt
   - **Trial by Oath**: Swearing innocence

3. **Punishment**
   - Cruel and barbaric
   - Public executions
   - Torture
   - No proportion between crime and punishment

4. **No Rational Basis**
   - No scientific investigation
   - Guilt determined by supernatural tests
   - No concept of evidence or proof

---

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake**: Don't confuse Pre-Classical with Classical School. Pre-Classical is pre-18th century with supernatural beliefs, while Classical is 18th century with rational thinking.

---

### **2. THE CLASSICAL SCHOOL**

#### **Time Period**
- Mid-18th century (1764 onwards)

#### **Founding Fathers**

**1. Cesare Beccaria (1738-1794)**
- Italian criminologist
- Author: "On Crimes and Punishments" (1764)

**2. Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832)**
- English philosopher
- Developer of "Utilitarian Philosophy"

---

#### **Core Principles**

> 🧠 **Memory Hook - "FREE WILL"**
> - **F**ree will and rationality
> - **R**eformative punishment
> - **E**quality before law
> - **E**qual punishment for equal crime
> - **W**ritten laws
> - **I**ndividual responsibility
> - **L**egality principle
> - **L**ess severe punishments

---

##### **1. Free Will**

- Human beings have **free will** to choose between right and wrong
- Criminals **rationally decide** to commit crime
- Crime is result of **rational choice**

##### **2. Hedonistic Calculus**

- Humans seek **pleasure** and avoid **pain**
- Before committing crime, person weighs:
  - **Benefits** of crime (pleasure)
  - **Costs** of crime (punishment/pain)
- If benefits > costs → Crime occurs

##### **3. Punishment as Deterrent**

**Purpose of Punishment:**
- To deter the individual from committing future crimes (**Specific Deterrence**)
- To deter others in society (**General Deterrence**)

**Principles of Punishment:**
- Should be **proportionate** to crime
- Should be **certain** (inevitable)
- Should be **swift** (quick)
- Should be **public** (to deter others)

##### **4. Legal Reforms Advocated**

**Beccaria's Reforms:**
- Abolition of **torture**
- Abolition of **capital punishment**
- Punishment should fit the **crime, not the criminal**
- **Certainty** of punishment more important than severity
- **Prevention** better than punishment

---

#### **Criticism of Classical School**

> ⚠️ **Limitations**

1. **Ignores Individual Differences**
   - Treats all criminals alike
   - No consideration of age, mental state, circumstances

2. **Assumes Perfect Rationality**
   - Not all criminals act rationally
   - Ignores passion, emotion, mental illness

3. **Ignores Social Factors**
   - No consideration of poverty, education, family
   - Environmental factors ignored

4. **Rigid Approach**
   - Same punishment for same crime
   - No flexibility for mitigating circumstances

5. **Unrealistic View of Free Will**
   - Many factors limit free will
   - Biological, psychological, social influences

---

### **3. NEO-CLASSICAL SCHOOL**

#### **Time Period**
- Late 18th to early 19th century

#### **Background**

Neo-Classical School emerged as a **reaction** to the rigidity of the Classical School.

##### **1. Recognition of Individual Circumstances**

**Modifications introduced:**
- Consideration of **mental state** of offender

| **Punishment** | Fixed for each crime | Flexible based on circumstances |
| **Mental State** | Ignored | Considered important |
| **Age** | Not considered | Children treated differently |
| **Judicial Role** | Mechanical application | Discretion in sentencing |
| **Focus** | Crime-centered | Criminal-centered (partial) |

---

> 🧠 **Memory Hook**: Neo-Classical = Classical + **Modifications** (age, insanity, circumstances)

---

## 🔬 **POSITIVIST APPROACH**

**Main Arguments:**

1. **Atavism Theory**
   - Criminals are **evolutionary throwbacks**
   - Represent earlier stage of human evolution
   - Resemble primitive humans or apes

2. **Physical Stigmata**
   - Criminals can be identified by physical characteristics

---

#### **Criticism of Lombroso**

> ⚠️ **Major Flaws**

1. **Unscientific Methodology**
   - Small sample size
   - No control group
   - Biased selection of subjects

2. **Physical Stigmata Discredited**
   - Many criminals have normal appearance
   - Many non-criminals have these features

3. **Ignores Social Factors**

---

#### **Theory: Multiple Factor Approach**

Ferri believed crime is caused by interaction of **three types of factors**:

> 🧠 **Memory Hook - "PAS"**
> - **P**hysical/Anthropological factors
> - **A**nthropological factors (individual)
> - **S**ocial factors

---

#### **Ferri's Three Causes of Crime**

##### **1. Anthropological Factors (Individual)**

**Biological:**
- Age
- Sex
- Race
- Heredity
- Physical constitution

**Psychological:**
- Intelligence
- Temperament
- Mental state

---

##### **2. Physical Factors (Natural Environment)**

| **1. Born/Instinctive Criminals** | Biological tendency to crime | Difficult to reform |
| **2. Insane Criminals** | Mental illness causes crime | Need medical treatment |
| **3. Habitual Criminals** | Become criminal due to environment | Can be reformed |
| **4. Occasional Criminals** | Commit crime by chance | Easy to reform |
| **5. Passionate Criminals** | Act under passion/emotion | Usually don't repeat |

---

#### **Ferri's Law of Criminal Saturation**

> **Theory**: Every society has a certain level of crime determined by social conditions, like a solution can only dissolve a certain amount of salt.

**Implication:**
- Crime level depends on social, physical, and anthropological conditions
- To reduce crime, must change these conditions
- Punishment alone cannot eliminate crime

---

#### **Ferri's Penal Substitutes**

Instead of punishment, Ferri proposed **social measures** to prevent crime:

**Examples:**
- Free trade to reduce unemployment
- Cheap housing for poor
- Better street lighting
- Reform of marriage laws

> Crime that violates two basic **moral sentiments** present in all civilized societies:
> 1. **Probity** (respect for property rights)
> 2. **Pity** (compassion, respect for human life)

---

#### **Natural vs Legal Crime**

| Aspect | Natural Crime | Legal Crime |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| **Definition** | Violates universal moral sentiments | Violates specific laws of a country |
| **Universality** | Same across all societies | Varies by country and time |
| **Examples** | Murder, robbery | Tax evasion, traffic violations |
| **Moral Basis** | Always immoral | May not be immoral |

---

#### **Garofalo's Classification of Criminals**

**Based on deficiency in moral sentiments:**

##### **1. Murderers**
- **Deficiency**: Complete lack of pity
- **Characteristics**: Cruel, violent
- **Treatment**: Elimination (death penalty)

##### **2. Violent Criminals**
- **Deficiency**: Deficient in pity

- **Characteristics**: Thieves, fraudsters
- **Treatment**: Transportation, forced labor

##### **4. Lascivious Criminals**

- **Treatment**: Varies based on severity

---

#### **Garofalo's Theory of Punishment**

**Principles:**

1. **Elimination**
   - Death penalty for murderers
   - Incurable criminals must be eliminated

2. **Partial Elimination**
   - Life imprisonment

---

#### **Theory: Laws of Imitation**

> **Core Idea**: Criminal behavior is **learned through imitation**.

Tarde argued that:
- Crime is **not hereditary**
- Crime is **not biological**
- Crime is **learned from others**
- Criminals **imitate** other criminals

---

#### **Three Laws of Imitation**

##### **Law 1: Law of Close Contact**

> "Imitation occurs between individuals who are in close physical and social contact."

- People imitate those **close** to them
- Family members, friends, neighbors
- Urban residents imitate urban patterns
- Rural residents imitate rural patterns

**Application to Crime:**
- Children imitate parents
- Juveniles imitate gang members
- Close association with criminals leads to crime

---

##### **Law 2: Law of Imitation of Superiors by Inferiors**

> "The inferior imitates the superior."

**Explanation:**
- Lower class imitates upper class
- Subordinates imitate leaders
- Young imitate old
- Less educated imitate educated

**Application to Crime:**
- Lower class may imitate crimes of upper class
- Fashion, lifestyle crimes
- White-collar crimes spread downward

---

##### **Law 3: Law of Insertion**

> "New patterns of behavior supersede old patterns."

**Explanation:**
- When two patterns conflict, one replaces the other
- Modern methods replace traditional methods
- Innovation in crime techniques

**Application to Crime:**
- New crime methods replace old
- Technology changes crime patterns
- Cyber crimes replace traditional crimes

---

#### **Modes of Imitation**

**1. Direct Imitation**
- Copying exact behavior
- Example: Copying crime technique seen in news

---

#### **Social Environment and Crime**

Tarde emphasized **social factors**:

1. **Economic Conditions**
   - Poverty breeds crime
   - Unemployment leads to property crimes

2. **Education**
   - Lack of education increases crime
   - But educated commit sophisticated crimes

3. **Urban vs Rural**
   - Cities have more crime
   - Anonymity in cities facilitates crime

4. **Media Influence**
   - Newspapers spread crime techniques
   - Publicity encourages imitation

---

#### **Tarde vs Lombroso**

| Aspect | Lombroso | Tarde |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Cause of Crime** | Biological heredity | Social imitation |
| **Criminal Type** | Born criminal | Made criminal |
| **Focus** | Individual biology | Social environment |
| **Solution** | Eliminate born criminals | Change social conditions |
| **Determinism** | Biological determinism | Social determinism |
| **Reform** | Difficult/impossible | Possible through education |

---

> 📌 **Exam Important**: Tarde's **Imitation Theory** is a precursor to modern **Social Learning Theories** (like Sutherland's Differential Association Theory in Module 07).
