## 📖 **INTRODUCTION TO SOCIOLOGICAL THEORIES**

### **Shift from Individual to Society**

**Previous Modules (01-04):** Focused on **individual** factors
- Biological traits (Lombroso)
- Psychological factors (Freud)
- Mental illness

**Modules 05-07:** Focus on **social** factors
- Social structure
- Culture and subculture
- Social processes

---

### **Core Premise**

> **Crime is not just an individual pathology, but a social phenomenon shaped by social structures, institutions, and processes.**

---

### **Why Sociological Theories Matter**

1. **Explain crime patterns**:
   - Why more crime in some areas?
   - Why poor commit more crime?

2. **Policy implications**:
   - Social reform can reduce crime
   - Change society, not just individual

3. **Broader perspective**:
   - Crime as social problem
   - Community-based solutions

---

## 🏗️ **SOCIAL STRUCTURE THEORY**

### **Definition**

**Social Structure** refers to:

> The organized pattern of social relationships and social institutions that together compose society.

**Includes:**
- Economic system
- Class structure
- Educational institutions
- Political system
- Family structure

---

### **Core Argument of Social Structure Theories**

> Crime is fundamentally caused by **disadvantaged economic class position**.

**Key Points:**
- People in lower class face barriers
- Limited legitimate opportunities
- Strain and frustration result
- Turn to crime as alternative

---

### **Three Branches of Social Structure Theory**

```
SOCIAL STRUCTURE THEORY
         |
   ______|______
   |     |     |
   |     |     |
Social   Strain  Cultural
Disorg.  Theory  Deviance
Theory           Theory
```

---

### **Common Themes**

All social structure theories share:

1. **Location Matters**
   - High crime in certain neighborhoods
   - Environmental factors

2. **Poverty Link**
   - Economic deprivation causes crime
   - Relative deprivation important

3. **Legitimate Opportunities**
   - Blocked opportunities → Crime
   - Access to education, jobs matters

4. **Social Change Can Reduce Crime**
   - Reform social conditions
   - Provide opportunities
   - Strengthen communities

---

<a name="social-disorganization"></a>
## 🏚️ **SOCIAL DISORGANIZATION THEORY**

### **Historical Background**

#### **Chicago School**

**Time:** 1920s-1930s

**Key Figures:**
- **Robert Park**
- **Ernest Burgess**
- **Clifford Shaw**
- **Henry McKay**

**Context:** Rapid urbanization, immigration, Chicago growth

---

### **Core Concept**

**Social Disorganization** is:

> The inability of a community to regulate itself according to common values and realize common goals.

**Result:** High crime rates in disorganized communities

---

### **The Concentric Zone Model**

#### **Burgess's Concentric Zones**

Park and Burgess studied Chicago and identified **5 concentric zones**:

```
        [Zone I]
      [Zone II]
     [Zone III]
    [Zone IV]
   [Zone V]
```

---

**Zone I: Central Business District (Loop)**
- Commercial area
- Factories, businesses
- Low residential population

**Zone II: Zone in Transition**
- **Highest crime rate**
- Deteriorating buildings
- Recent immigrants
- Poorest residents
- Social disorganization

**Zone III: Zone of Working Men's Homes**
- Working-class neighborhoods
- More stable
- Lower crime than Zone II

**Zone IV: Residential Zone**
- Middle-class homes
- Better conditions
- Lower crime

**Zone V: Commuter Zone**
- Suburbs
- Affluent residents
- Lowest crime

---

#### **Key Finding**

> 📌 **Shaw and McKay Discovery**: Crime rates highest in **Zone II** (Zone in Transition) and **remained high** even as ethnic groups changed.

**Implication:**
- Not the people (ethnicity) causing crime
- But the **area characteristics** causing crime
- Social disorganization is the problem

---

### **Characteristics of Socially Disorganized Areas**

| Feature | Disorganized Area | Organized Area |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| **Population** | High turnover | Stable residents |
| **Ethnicity** | Heterogeneous | Homogeneous |
| **Poverty** | High poverty | Economic stability |
| **Housing** | Deteriorating | Well-maintained |
| **Social Control** | Weak | Strong |
| **Common Values** | Lacking | Shared values |
| **Social Institutions** | Weak (schools, churches) | Strong institutions |
| **Crime Rate** | High | Low |

---

### **Mechanisms of Social Disorganization**

#### **1. Residential Instability**

**Characteristics:**
- High turnover of residents
- People don't stay long
- Transient population

**Effect:**
- No attachment to community
- Don't care about neighborhood
- Won't intervene in crime

---

#### **2. Ethnic Heterogeneity**

**Characteristics:**
- Many different ethnic groups
- Language barriers
- Cultural differences

**Effect:**
- Difficulty communicating
- Mistrust among groups
- Cannot unite for common goals

---

#### **3. Economic Deprivation**

**Characteristics:**
- High poverty rate
- Unemployment
- Struggling families

**Effect:**
- Stress and strain
- Focus on survival
- Less community involvement

---

### **Breakdown of Social Control**

#### **Informal Social Control Weakens**

**What is Informal Social Control?**
- Community members monitoring behavior
- Neighbors watching out for each other
- Adults supervising youth
- Social pressure to conform

**When It Breaks Down:**
- People don't know neighbors
- Fear prevents intervention
- "Not my problem" attitude
- Youth unsupervised
- Crime increases

---

### **Collective Efficacy**

**Modern Concept (Sampson & Raudenbush):**

> **Collective Efficacy** = Social cohesion + Willingness to intervene

**Components:**

**1. Social Cohesion**
- Trust among neighbors
- Shared values
- Mutual support

**2. Informal Social Control**
- Willingness to intervene
- Monitoring youth
- Confronting troublemakers

**Finding:** High collective efficacy → Low crime, regardless of poverty

---

### **Policy Implications**

**To Reduce Crime:**

1. **Increase Stability**
   - Encourage home ownership
   - Stabilize population
   - Long-term residents

2. **Strengthen Community**
   - Community organizations
   - Block watch programs
   - Recreational facilities

3. **Improve Physical Environment**
   - Repair buildings
   - Better lighting
   - Remove graffiti (Broken Windows Theory)

4. **Empower Residents**
   - Community policing
   - Resident participation
   - Local decision-making

---

### **Criticism**

> ⚠️ **Limitations**

1. **Ignores Individual Differences**
   - Not all poor commit crime
   - Most people in disorganized areas are law-abiding

2. **Class Bias**
   - Focuses on lower-class crime
   - Ignores white-collar crime

3. **Deterministic**
   - Implies people are passive victims
   - Ignores free will and choice

4. **Causal Direction Unclear**
   - Does disorganization cause crime?
   - Or does crime cause disorganization?

## 🎯 **MERTON, ANOMIE AND STRAIN**

### **Robert K. Merton (1910-2003)**

**Background:**
- American sociologist
- Student of Talcott Parsons
- Developed **Strain Theory** (1938)

---

### **Émile Durkheim's Anomie**

**Before Merton:**

**Durkheim (1897)** introduced **anomie**:

> **Anomie** = A state of normlessness; breakdown of social norms regulating behavior.

**Durkheim's Argument:**
- Rapid social change disrupts norms
- People unclear about rules
- Social regulation breaks down
- Deviance increases

**Application:**
- During economic boom or bust
- Social upheaval
- Weak social institutions

---

### **Merton's Adaptation: Strain Theory**

**Merton's Modification:**

Merton adapted Durkheim's anomie to explain crime in **American society**.

---

### **Core Components**

#### **1. Cultural Goals**

> Culturally defined goals that all members of society are encouraged to achieve.

**In America (and modern societies):**
- **Financial success**
- Material wealth
- Status and prestige
- "American Dream"

**Universal Emphasis:**
- Everyone should strive for success
- Success = Wealth
- Legitimate to pursue wealth

---

#### **2. Institutionalized Means**

> Socially acceptable ways to achieve cultural goals.

**Legitimate Means:**
- Education
- Hard work
- Career advancement
- Savings and investment
- Business

---

### **The Problem: Disjunction**

> 📌 **Merton's Key Insight**: Society emphasizes **goals** for everyone, but does NOT provide **equal means** for everyone.

**Result:**
- Everyone wants success (cultural goal)
- But not everyone has legitimate means (education, jobs)
- This creates **STRAIN**

---

### **Definition of Strain**

> **Strain** = The pressure people feel when they cannot achieve culturally valued goals through legitimate means.

**Analogy:**
```
Society says: "Be successful! Get rich!"
Reality: "But you have no education, no job, no opportunities"
Result: STRAIN → Frustration → Deviance
```

---

### **Merton's Five Modes of Adaptation**

When faced with strain, people adapt in **5 ways**:

| Mode | Cultural Goals | Institutional Means | Explanation | Example |
|------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| **1. Conformity** | ✅ Accept | ✅ Accept | Accept goals, use legitimate means | Working hard, getting education |
| **2. Innovation** | ✅ Accept | ❌ Reject | Accept goals, use illegitimate means | **CRIME** - theft, drug dealing |
| **3. Ritualism** | ❌ Reject | ✅ Accept | Lower goals, follow rules | Low-ambition worker |
| **4. Retreatism** | ❌ Reject | ❌ Reject | Reject both, withdraw | Drug addicts, homeless |
| **5. Rebellion** | 🔄 Replace | 🔄 Replace | Replace with new goals/means | Revolutionaries, terrorists |

---

### **Detailed Explanation of Modes**

#### **1. Conformity** ✅✅

**Most Common Adaptation**

**Characteristics:**
- Accept cultural goals (want success)
- Accept institutional means (work hard, get education)
- Majority of people

**Example:**
- Student studies hard
- Gets degree
- Gets good job
- Achieves success legitimately

> **Not Criminal** - Law-abiding behavior

---

#### **2. Innovation** ✅❌

**MOST RELEVANT TO CRIME**

**Characteristics:**
- **Accept cultural goals** (want wealth, success)
- **Reject institutional means** (don't use legitimate methods)
- Use **illegitimate means** to achieve goals

**Why?**
- Blocked legitimate opportunities
- Poverty, lack of education
- Discrimination
- Faster results

**Examples of Innovation:**
- **Theft**: Want money, steal it
- **Drug dealing**: Want wealth, sell drugs
- **Fraud**: Want success, cheat
- **Robbery**: Want money, take by force
- **Embezzlement**: Want more, steal from employer

> 📌 **Merton's Key Point**: Innovation explains **property crime** and **white-collar crime**.

---

**Types of Innovators:**

**a) Lower-Class Innovators**
- Blocked from legitimate success
- Turn to street crime
- Theft, drug dealing, robbery

**b) Middle/Upper-Class Innovators**
- Have some opportunities
- Want MORE success
- Turn to white-collar crime
- Fraud, embezzlement, insider trading

---

#### **3. Ritualism** ❌✅

**Characteristics:**
- **Reject cultural goals** (give up on success)
- **Accept institutional means** (follow rules rigidly)
- Lower aspirations
- Overly conformist

**Why?**
- Frustrated by blocked opportunities
- Fear of failure
- Play it safe

**Example:**
- Bureaucrat who follows every rule
- Low ambition, no risk-taking
- "Just doing my job"
- Goes through motions

> **Not typically criminal**, but deviant in sense of giving up on cultural goals.

---

#### **4. Retreatism** ❌❌

**Characteristics:**
- **Reject cultural goals** (don't want success)
- **Reject institutional means** (don't follow conventional paths)
- Withdraw from society

**Who?**
- Drug addicts
- Alcoholics
- Homeless
- Mentally ill
- Drop-outs

**Why?**
- Failed at both legitimate and illegitimate means
- Double failure
- Internalize failure
- Escape from society

**Criminal Behavior:**
- Drug use (if illegal)
- Vagrancy
- Minor crimes for survival
- Not goal-oriented crime

> **Least Common Adaptation** - Merton called them "in society but not of it"

---

#### **5. Rebellion** 🔄🔄

**Characteristics:**
- **Reject existing cultural goals**
- **Reject existing institutional means**
- **Replace with NEW goals and means**
- Want to change society

**Who?**
- Political radicals
- Revolutionaries
- Terrorists
- Reformers

**Why?**
- Believe system is unjust
- Want structural change
- Collective solution

**Criminal Behavior:**
- Political violence
- Terrorism
- Sabotage
- Riots
- Rebellion against state

> **Unique Adaptation**: Only one that seeks to change the system, not adapt to it.

## 📊 **MERTON'S THEORY - DETAILED ANALYSIS**

### **Structural Sources of Strain**

#### **1. Class Structure**

**Lower Class:**
- Limited education
- Low-paying jobs
- Discrimination
- **Most strain** → Most innovation (crime)

**Middle Class:**
- Some opportunities
- Moderate strain
- May turn to white-collar crime

**Upper Class:**
- Best opportunities
- Least strain
- May commit corporate crime for MORE

---

#### **2. Cultural Emphasis**

**American Dream Ideology:**
- Success is for everyone
- Anyone can make it
- Wealth equals worth
- No excuse for failure

**Problem:**
- Unrealistic for many
- Ignores structural barriers
- Blames individuals
- Creates intense pressure

---

### **Why Innovation (Crime) Occurs**

**Merton's Explanation:**

**Step 1:** Society emphasizes monetary success
```
"Be rich! Be successful!"
```

**Step 2:** But doesn't provide equal means
```
"But you're poor, uneducated, discriminated against"
```

**Step 3:** Strain/Pressure builds
```
"I want success but can't achieve it legitimately"
```

**Step 4:** Innovation - Use illegitimate means
```
"I'll steal, deal drugs, commit fraud to get success"
```

---

### **Types of Crime Explained**

**Property Crime (Theft, Burglary):**
- Want money (cultural goal)
- No legitimate means (job, education)
- Steal to get money (innovation)

**Drug Dealing:**
- Want wealth and status
- Blocked from legitimate success
- Sell drugs for money (innovation)

**White-Collar Crime:**
- Want MORE success
- Legitimate means available but slow
- Use fraud, embezzlement for more (innovation)

**Organized Crime:**
- Want success
- Blocked from legitimate business
- Create illegal enterprises (innovation)

---

### **Why Not Everyone in Poverty Commits Crime?**

> ⚠️ **Important Question**: If poverty causes strain, why don't ALL poor people commit crime?

**Answers:**

1. **Conformity Still Most Common**
   - Most people choose legitimate means
   - Even if slow or uncertain

2. **Individual Differences**
   - Personality, values, self-control
   - Family socialization

3. **Relative Deprivation Matters**
   - Not absolute poverty
   - Comparison with others
   - Feeling deprived relative to reference group

4. **Other Adaptations Available**
   - Ritualism (lower expectations)
   - Retreatism (withdraw)

---

## 🔄 **INSTITUTIONAL ANOMIE THEORY**

### **Messner and Rosenfeld's Extension**

**Modern Development (1994):**

Expanded Merton's theory:

**Argument:**
- In America, **economy dominates** all other institutions
- Economic success overshadows everything
- Other institutions (family, education, religion) weakened
- Result: High crime rates

---

### **Dominance of Economic Institution**

**Four Ways Economy Dominates:**

#### **1. Devaluation**
- Non-economic roles devalued
- "Just a teacher" vs "Successful businessperson"
- Parenting, community service not respected

#### **2. Accommodation**
- Other institutions accommodate to economy
- School schedules fit work schedules
- Family time sacrificed for work

#### **3. Penetration**
- Economic norms penetrate other institutions
- Education becomes vocational
- Relationships become transactional

#### **4. Weak Social Controls**
- Family weakened (both parents work)
- Less supervision of children
- Community ties weaken
- Crime increases

---

## 📊 **GENERAL STRAIN THEORY (GST)**

### **Robert Agnew (1992)**

**Modern Extension of Merton:**

Agnew broadened concept of strain beyond economic goals.

---

### **Three Types of Strain**

#### **1. Failure to Achieve Positively Valued Goals**

**Classic Merton Strain:**
- Want something (money, status)
- Cannot achieve it
- Frustration → Crime

**Three Subtypes:**

**a) Disjunction between Aspirations and Expectations**
- What you want vs what you expect to get
- High aspirations, low expectations → Strain

**b) Disjunction between Expectations and Achievements**
- What you expect vs what you actually get
- Expected promotion, didn't get it → Strain

**c) Disjunction between Just/Fair Outcomes and Actual Outcomes**
- What you deserve vs what you get
- Sense of unfairness → Strain

---

#### **2. Removal of Positively Valued Stimuli**

**Loss of Something Good:**

**Examples:**
- Death of loved one
- Breakup of relationship
- Loss of job
- Moving away from friends
- Illness

**Result:** Anger, frustration → Crime to cope or revenge

---

#### **3. Presentation of Negatively Valued Stimuli**

**Exposure to Something Bad:**

**Examples:**
- Child abuse
- Bullying
- Negative school experiences
- Harsh parenting
- Criminal victimization
- Discrimination

**Result:** Anger, frustration → Crime as response

---

### **Coping with Strain**

**Not All Strain Leads to Crime:**

**Legitimate Coping:**
- Problem-solving
- Seeking support
- Cognitive reappraisal
- Exercise, hobbies

**Illegitimate Coping (Crime):**
- Violence (release anger)
- Theft (get money)
- Drug use (escape)

---

### **Factors Affecting Criminal Response**

**Makes Crime More Likely:**
- Low self-control
- Association with criminal peers
- Few legitimate coping resources
- Belief that crime is acceptable
- Low social support

---

## 📊 **COMPARISON OF STRAIN THEORIES**

| Aspect | Merton's Strain | General Strain (Agnew) |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Time** | 1938 | 1992 |
| **Focus** | Economic goals | Multiple goals |
| **Strain Source** | Blocked opportunities | 3 types of strain |
| **Goals** | Monetary success | Any valued goal |
| **Scope** | Macro-level (society) | Micro-level (individual) |
| **Emotions** | Implicit frustration | Explicit anger, frustration |
| **Crime Types** | Property crime | All crime types |

---

## ✅ **SUMMARY & KEY TAKEAWAYS**

### **Core Concepts**

1. **Social Structure Theories**: Crime caused by social and economic disadvantage

2. **Social Disorganization Theory** (Shaw & McKay):
   - Crime concentrates in Zone II (transition zone)
   - Social disorganization, not ethnicity, causes crime
   - Weak social control → High crime

3. **Merton's Strain Theory**:
   - Gap between cultural goals and means creates strain
   - Five adaptations: Conformity, **Innovation (Crime)**, Ritualism, Retreatism, Rebellion
   - Innovation explains property and white-collar crime

4. **General Strain Theory** (Agnew):
   - Three types of strain (failure, loss, negative stimuli)
   - Strain → Anger → Crime
   - Not all strain leads to crime (coping matters)
