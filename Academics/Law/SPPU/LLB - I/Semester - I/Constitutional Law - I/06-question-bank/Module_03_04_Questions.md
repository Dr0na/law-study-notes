3. Bachan Singh (1982)
   - Rule of law excludes arbitrariness
   - Art. 14 = guarantee against arbitrariness

APPLICATIONS
1. Administrative Discretion
   - Air India v. Nergesh Meerza (unguided discretion)
   - Re Kerala Education Bill (valid if policy deducible)

2. Administrative Action
   - Ramana Dayaram Shetty (airport tender)

### 📗 **SECTION B: SHORT NOTES (5-7 Marks)**

#### **SN1. Doctrine of Eclipse**

**Answer:**

**Bhikaji v. State of M.P.:**

Pre-Constitution law inconsistent with FRs is **eclipsed**, not dead.

**Principle:**
- Law remains dormant
- Becomes operative if Constitution amended to remove inconsistency
- Applies only to pre-Constitution laws
- Post-Constitution laws void ab initio

**Example:** Pre-Constitution law violating Art. 19(1)(g) was eclipsed.

---

#### **SN2. Doctrine of Severability**

**Answer:**

If part of law unconstitutional, only that part void if severable.

**Test:**
1. Can invalid part be separated?
2. Does remainder form complete code?
3. Was remainder intended to operate independently?

**Case: A.K. Gopalan v. Madras**

Court can sever invalid portion if remainder can stand independently.

**Purpose:** Save valid portions of law.

---

#### **SN3. Basic Structure Doctrine**

**Answer:**

**Case: Kesavananda Bharati v. Kerala, AIR 1973**

**Principle:** Parliament can amend Constitution BUT cannot alter basic structure.

**Basic Features (Illustrative):**
1. Supremacy of Constitution
2. Republican & Democratic form
3. Secular character
4. Federal character
5. Separation of powers
6. Judicial review
7. Fundamental Rights (especially 14, 19, 21)
8. Rule of Law
9. Independence of Judiciary

**Effect:** Even constitutional amendments can be struck down.

**Evolution:**
- Shankari Prasad (1951) - Amendment not law
- Golak Nath (1967) - Amendment is law (overruled)
- Kesavananda (1973) - Amendment not law BUT basic structure protected

---

#### **SN4. Creamy Layer**

**Answer:**

**Case: Indra Sawhney v. UOI, 1993**

**Principle:** Socially advanced members of backward class must be excluded from reservation benefits.

**Rationale:**
- Reservation for truly disadvantaged
- Benefits should not be monopolized by advanced members
- More appropriately serves Art. 16(4) purpose

**Application:** Applicable to OBCs, not SC/ST (as per Mandal judgment)

**Identification:** Government to frame criteria based on economic, social parameters.

---

#### **SN5. Compassionate Appointment**

**Answer:**

**V. Sivamurthy v. AP, 2008**

**Nature:**
