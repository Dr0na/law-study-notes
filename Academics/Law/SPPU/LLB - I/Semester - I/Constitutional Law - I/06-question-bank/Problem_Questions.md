## ⚖️ **ARTICLE 14 PROBLEMS**

### Problem 1: Classification Challenge

**Question:**

State of Gujarat passed a law:
1. Only persons above 30 years eligible for Civil Judge posts
2. 80% seats reserved for Gujarat domicile candidates
3. Women judges to retire at 55, men at 58
4. Direct recruits and promotees in same cadre, but promotees' seniority fixed below all direct recruits

**Advise on constitutional validity of each provision under Article 14.**

---

**Answer:**

**PROVISION 1: Age 30 for Civil Judge**

**ISSUE:** Whether age qualification violates Art. 14?

**RULE:**
- Art. 14 permits reasonable classification (I-R test)
- Qualifications can be prescribed (Shiv Ram Sharma)
- Must have rational nexus with post

**APPLICATION:**
- Civil Judge position requires maturity, judgment
- Age 30 has rational nexus with requirements
- Intelligible differentia exists (above 30 vs below 30)
- Not arbitrary

**CONCLUSION:** **Likely VALID**

---

**PROVISION 2: 80% domicile reservation**

**ISSUE:** Whether domicile-based reservation violates Arts. 14 and 16?

**RULE:**
- Art. 16(3): Parliament may prescribe residence requirement
- For **specified classes** of posts
- A.V.S. Narasimha Rao case
- Can be for whole State, not part of State

**APPLICATION:**
- 80% is excessive
- State law, not Parliamentary law (Art. 16(3) requires Parliament)
- Violates Art. 16(2) (residence as ground)
- No authority under Art. 16(3)

**CONCLUSION:** **INVALID** - Violates Arts. 14 and 16

---

**PROVISION 3: Different retirement age**

**ISSUE:** Gender-based discrimination in retirement?

**RULE:**
- Art. 16(2) prohibits discrimination on ground of "sex"
- Must have rational nexus
- Air India v. Nergesh Meerza

**APPLICATION:**
- Differentiation solely on sex
- No rational nexus with efficiency
- Women equally capable after 55
- Arbitrary discrimination

**CONCLUSION:** **INVALID** - Violates Art. 16(2)

---

**PROVISION 4: Seniority of promotees below direct recruits**

**ISSUE:** Whether fixed seniority violates Art. 14?

**RULE:**
- Seniority fixation must be objective and fair
- Not arbitrary (Paliwal case)
- If same cadre, unequal treatment needs justification

**APPLICATION:**
- Both in same cadre
- Promotees always below direct recruits
- Ignores performance, experience
- May be arbitrary

**CONCLUSION:** **Likely INVALID** if no rational basis shown

---

4. Carry forward for 5 years (can accumulate to 75%)

- Applies to OBC only (not SC/ST per Mandal judgment)

**APPLICATION:**
- Order has 30% OBC
- No creamy layer exclusion mentioned
- Violates Indra Sawhney mandate

**CONCLUSION:** **INVALID** for OBC quota (must exclude creamy layer)

---

**ISSUE 3: Promotions to Highest Posts**

**RULE:**
- Rangachari (1962): Promotion reservations valid
- But Indra Sawhney: No reservation in promotions to higher posts
- Later amendments: Arts. 16(4A), (4B) added

**APPLICATION:**
- Promotions to highest posts questioned
- Constitutional amendments now allow
- But efficiency consideration required

**CONCLUSION:** May be challenged; depends on current constitutional position post-amendments

---

**ISSUE 4: Carry Forward (75%)**

**RULE:**
- Devadasan: > 50% in single year invalid
- A.B.S.K. Sangh: For SC/ST different approach (66% upheld)
- But general rule: 50% ceiling in any year

**APPLICATION:**
- 75% clearly exceeds 50%
- Even for SC/ST, questionable
- Violates Balaji principle

**CONCLUSION:** **INVALID** (exceeds 50% in single year)
