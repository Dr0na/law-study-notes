# Module 06: Right against Exploitation (Articles 23 and 24)

## Introduction

**Articles 23 and 24**, though Fundamental Rights, lay dormant for almost thirty-two years after the Constitution came into force and there was hardly any significant judicial pronouncement concerning these constitutional provisions.

Since **1982**, however, these Articles have assumed great significance and have become **potent instruments in the hands of the Courts to ameliorate the pitiable condition of the poor** in the country.

## Article 23 - Prohibition of Traffic in Human Beings and Forced Labour

### Article 23(1)

According to **Art. 23(1)**, traffic in human beings, begar, and other similar forms of forced labour are **prohibited** and any contravention of this provision shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law.

**A significant feature of Art. 23 is that it protects the individual not only against the State but also against private citizens.**

Most of the Fundamental Rights operate as limitations on the power of the State and impose negative obligations on the State not to encroach on individual liberty and the rights are only enforceable against the State. But there are certain Fundamental Rights which are **enforceable against the whole world**, e.g., **Arts. 17, 23 and 24**.

---

## Begar Abolished

The term **begar** means **compulsory work without any payment**.

Withholding of pay of a government employee as a punishment has been held to be invalid in view of Art. 23 which prohibits begar.

**'To ask a man to work and then not to pay him any salary or wages savours of begar. It is a Fundamental Right of a citizen of India not to be compelled to work without wages.'**

---

## Traffic in Human Beings

The expression **'traffic in human beings,'** commonly known as **slavery**, implies the buying and selling of human beings as if they are chattels, and such a practice is constitutionally abolished.

**Traffic in women for immoral purposes** is also covered by this expression.

---

## Forced Labour

### What is NOT Forced Labour

The kind of 'forced labour' contemplated by the Article has to be something in the nature of either traffic in human beings or begar. **Conscription for police service or military service cannot come under either.**

### Civil Servant Under Suspension

A rule in the Punjab Civil Service Rules provided that a civil servant under suspension on a charge of misconduct would not retire on his reaching the date of retirement but would remain in service until the enquiry into the charges against him is concluded and a final order passed.

The Supreme Court held that this rule did not infringe Art. 23 as it could not be equated to begar or 'forced labour' as the servant on suspension did no work.

### Teachers' Duties

The Government demanding services of teachers for census, election, family planning duties is **not violative of Art. 23(1)**.

---

## Expansive Interpretation - Post 1982

The Supreme Court has given an **expansive significance** to the term "forced labour" used in Art. 23(1) in a series of cases beginning with the **Asiad case in 1982**.

So, the Court insisted that **every form of forced labour is within the inhibition of Art. 23** and it makes no difference whether the person who is forced to give his labour or service to another is remunerated or not.

**Even payment of wages less than the minimum wages would be regarded as forced labour.**

### Case: Sanjit Roy v. State of Rajasthan

Payment by the State of wages lower than the minimum wages to persons employed on famine relief work was held **invalid under Art. 23**.

### Equal Remuneration Act, 1976

Non-observance of the **Equal Remuneration Act, 1976**, by government contractors raises questions under Art. 14. The Act has been enacted in pursuance of Art. 39, a Directive Principle.

### Case: Labourers Working on Salal Hydro-Project v. State of Jammu & Kashmir

The Supreme Court found that the workmen employed on the project were being denied the rights and benefits ensured to the workmen under various labour laws. For example, the provisions of the Inter-State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1979, were not being implemented at all and violations of the Minimum Wages Act and the Contract Labour Act were also taking place.

The Court also directed the Central Government to identify the inter-State workers at the project site and ensure to them the benefits of the Inter-State Migrant Workmen Act.

## Hard Labour by Prisoners

The Kerala High Court has declared that the **prisoners are entitled to payment of reasonable wages** for the work taken from them. The right not to be exploited in contravention of Art. 23(1) is a right guaranteed to a citizen.

---

## Bonded Labour

### The Bonded System

Under the bonded system, one person is bonded to provide labour to another for years and years until a debt is supposed to be wiped out. The bonded system is designed to enable a few socially and economically powerful persons to exploit the weaker sections of the people.

### Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976

To give effect to Art. 23, Parliament has enacted the **Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976**.

In spite of the constitutional and legal provisions abolishing bonded labour, the implementation of the law has been very tardy at the administrative level as all kinds of vested interests make themselves felt in this area.

**Difficult problems involved in eradicating bonded labour:**
- Problem of identifying bonded labour
- Problem of rehabilitation after release from the bondage

### Case: Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India

The slow implementation of the law banning bonded labour has given rise to several judicial pronouncements by way of **public interest litigation**.

In Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India, in an action brought in the Supreme Court by an organisation dedicated to the cause of release of bonded labourers. **The Court has linked Arts. 23 and 21** in the context of the bonded labour.

### Case: Neeraja Choudhary v. State of Madhya Pradesh

The Court has insisted not only on the release of the bonded labourers, but has also laid stress on their **proper rehabilitation**.

---

## Prostitutes

The expression **"traffic in human beings"** used in Art. 23(1), commonly known as slavery, implies the buying and selling of human beings as if they are chattels.

### Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956

Parliament has enacted the **Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act, 1956 (SITA)**, with the object of inhibiting or abolishing the immoral traffic in women and girls. The Act is now known as the **Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956**.

**The Act aims at:**
- Suppressing the evils of prostitution in women and girls
- Achieving a public purpose, viz., to rescue the fallen women and girls
- To stamp out the evils of prostitution
- To provide an opportunity to these fallen victims so that they could become decent members of the society

### Case: Vishal Jeet v. Union of India

The Supreme Court has directed the State Governments to instruct their **law enforcing authorities to take action under the law to eradicate child prostitution**.

### Case: Gaurav Jain v. Union of India

The question of **rehabilitation of prostitutes and their children** was again brought before the Supreme Court through a public interest litigation under Art. 32. A two Judge Bench took cognisance of the matter. The Court issued several directions relating to:
- The rehabilitation of the children of the prostitutes
- Child prostitutes
- Establishment of juvenile homes for them

## Article 24 - Prohibition of Employment of Children

### Introduction

It is realised that a total ban on child labour may not be socially feasible in the socio-economic environment of the country. Accordingly, **Art. 24 puts only a partial restriction on employment of child labour**.

**Article 24** prohibits the employment of a child below the age of **fourteen years** to work in:
- Any factory
- Any mine, **OR**
- Any other hazardous employment

---

## Enforcement Against All

The Supreme Court has emphasized in **Asiad** that Art. 24 embodies a Fundamental Right **"which is plainly and indubitably enforceable against everyone."**

By reason of the compulsive mandate in Art. 24, **no one can employ a child below the age of 14 years in a hazardous employment like construction work**.

### Case: Labourers Working on Salal Hydro-Project v. State of Jammu and Kashmir

The Court has reiterated this ruling. Construction work being hazardous employment, children below 14 cannot be employed on any such work because of the constitutional prohibition contained in Art. 24.

**The Court has directed the Central Government to enforce this prohibition.** It has generally told the Government to:
- Persuade the workmen to send their children to school
- Provide for free education there

The Court realizes that in the prevailing socio-economic development of the country, prohibition of child labour completely would not be acceptable to large masses of the people because of their poverty.

## Public Interest Litigation on Child Labour

The question of employment of child labour has been brought to the attention of the Supreme Court in several cases by way of **public interest litigation**.

### Case: M.C. Mehta v. State of Tamil Nadu

The Court has considered the constitutional perspectives of the abolition of the child labour in the notorious **Sivakasi Match industries**.

The Court has issued **detailed directions to eradicate the practice** of employing children below the age of 14 years in this hazardous industry. The Court has insisted that the employers must comply with the provisions of the **Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act**.

---

## Link with Other Fundamental Rights

### Right to Education

In **Unnikrishnan**, and now in **Art. 21-A** education up to the age of 14 years has been declared to be a Fundamental Right.

### Other Rights

Right to health, right to potable water, meaningful right to life--all these rights have been declared to be Fundamental Rights. **The child is equally entitled to all these Fundamental Rights.**

---

## Statutory Provisions

Several statutes expressly prohibit the employment of children below the age of 14 years such as:
- The **Apprentice Act, 1961**
- The **Factories Act, 1948**
- The **Mines Act, 1952**

---

## Conclusion

Despite these statutory provisions **India continues to host the largest number of child labourers in the world today**.
