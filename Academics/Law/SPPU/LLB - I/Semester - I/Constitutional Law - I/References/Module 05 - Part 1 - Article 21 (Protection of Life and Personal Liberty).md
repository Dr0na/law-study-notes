# Module 05 - Part 1: Article 21 (Protection of Right to Life and Personal Liberty)

## Introduction

**Article 21** of the Constitution lays that: **"No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law."**

But in no country citizens enjoy absolute liberty. Liberty has got to be limited in order to be effectively possessed. If people were given complete and absolute liberty without any social control, the result would be ruin. Law is a scheme of social control. This is the principle embodied in our Constitution when it says that life and personal liberty are subject to **"the procedure established by law"**.

**The right guaranteed in Art. 21 is available to 'citizens' as well as 'non-citizens'.**

## Personal Liberty - Evolution of Interpretation

### Narrow Interpretation: A.K. Gopalan Case

The words **"personal liberty"** under Article 21 if interpreted widely are capable of including the rights mentioned in Article 19.

In **Gopalan's case** the Supreme Court took a very literal view and interpreted these words very narrowly. It was said to mean only liberty relating to, or concerning the person or body of the individual. It was further limited to freedom from punitive and preventive detention.

**Gopalan held the field for almost three decades, i.e. 1950 to 1978.**

### Two Major Principles from Gopalan

**Gopalan settled two major points in relation to Art. 21:**

1. **First Principle:** Arts. 19, 21 and 22 were mutually exclusive and independent of each other and that Art. 19 was not to apply to a law affecting personal liberty to which Art. 21 would apply
2. **Second Principle:** A 'law' affecting life or personal liberty could not be declared unconstitutional merely because it lacked natural justice or due procedure. The legislature was free to lay down any procedure for this purpose

**Important Note:** Violation of personal liberty by private individual was not within the purview of Art. 21, and in such a situation remedy was to be sought under the ordinary law and not under Art. 21.

### Illustration: Ram Singh v. Delhi

A person was detained under the Preventive Detention Act for making speeches prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. At this time, Art. 19(2) did not contain the expression 'public order' and so the freedom of speech could not be controlled for that purpose, but a preventive detention order, a much more drastic restriction on the person concerned, could be passed on that basis.

---

## Softening of the Rigid View

In course of time, this rigid judicial view came to be softened somewhat.

### Bank Nationalization Case (1970)

The beginning of the new trend is to be found in the **Bank Nationalization case** decided in 1970.

In the Bank Nationalization case, Art. 19(1)(f) was applied to a law enacted under Art. 31(2). This was the period when the Supreme Court was more solicitous to protect the right to property than the right to personal freedom.

### Bennett Coleman Case

In another major development, in the **Bennett Coleman case**, The Court declared that if a law affected freedom of speech, its reasonableness became assessable with reference to Art. 19(2) even though it was not enacted directly to control the freedom of speech.

### John Martin v. State of West Bengal

Another challenge was mounted to MISA on the ground that conferment of drastic discretionary power of preventive detention, which infringed personal liberty, on the district magistrate, who was not a very high official, violated Art. 19.

**Rejecting the contention**, the Court stated that the district magistrate was the head of the district administration, and was in charge of maintaining law and order and essential supplies and services within the district. Further, the exercise of power to order preventive detention was subject to the supervisory control of the State Government.

### P.L. Lakhanpal v. Union of India

The Supreme Court again departed from the strict Gopalan view. This was a case of preventive detention under the Defence of India Rules during the emergency when the normal safeguards provided by Art. 22 were not available. There was however a provision for review of detention cases every six months.

The Court ruled that although the making of the initial detention order was an exercise of administrative power, **the review was a quasi-judicial function** and, therefore, the detenu should have been given a right of representation at that stage.

Such a judicial view meant that while lack of natural justice in the law would not make it invalid, nevertheless, **the Court could still impose natural justice by its interpretative process**.

---

## Maneka Gandhi: The New Approach

### Case: Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India

**Maneka Gandhi is a landmark case of the post-emergency period.** Since Maneka the Supreme Court has shown great sensitivity to the protection of personal liberty.

The Court has re-interpreted Art. 21 and **practically overruled Gopalan** in Maneka Gandhi which can be regarded as a highly creative judicial pronouncement on the part of the Supreme Court.

Not only that, since Maneka, the Supreme Court has given to Art. 21, broader and broader interpretation so as to imply many more Fundamental Rights. In course of time, **Art. 21 has proved to be a very fruitful source of rights of the people**.

### Key Principles from Maneka Gandhi

1. **Interconnection of Articles:** The Court reiterated the proposition that **Arts. 14, 19 and 21 are not mutually exclusive**. A nexus has been established between these three Articles
2. **Higher Standard:** A law prescribing a procedure for depriving a person of 'personal liberty' has to meet the requirements of Art. 19
3. **Dual Compliance:** The procedure established by law in Art. 21 must answer the requirement of Art. 14 as well
4. **Judicial Review:** The Court may declare the law itself unconstitutional by reading Art. 21 along with Arts. 14 and 19
5. **Anti-Arbitrariness:** The Supreme Court has ruled specifically that **Art. 14 outlaws unreasonableness and arbitrariness**

**And finally SC in Maneka Gandhi's case overruled Gopalan's decision and upheld Kharak Singh's Judgement. Widen the scope of the word "personal liberty", give additional protection under Art. 19.**

**The attempt of the court should be to expand the reach and ambit of the fundamental rights than to attenuate their meaning.**

---

## Expanded Scope of Personal Liberty - Post Maneka

### Right to Write and Publish

A person detained in preventive detention wrote a scientific book, but the government refused permission to him to send it to his wife for publication.

In **Prabhakar**, the Supreme Court held it to be an infringement of detenu's personal liberty as under Art. 21 prohibiting a person from writing a book without there being any legal provision to that effect would be unconstitutional.

### Right to Travel Abroad

#### Case: Satwant Singh v. A.P.O.

The right to travel abroad was held to be an aspect of **'personal liberty'** of an individual and, therefore, no person can be deprived of his right to travel except according to the procedure established by law.

### Freedom of Trade Not Covered

#### Case: Sodhan Singh

The Supreme Court has ruled that Art. 21 does not cover freedom of trade or commerce. **"The right to carry on any trade or business and the concept of life and personal liberty within Art. 21 are too remote to be connected together"**.

---

## Due Process of Law

### U.S. Constitutional Concept

The **V Amendment of the U.S. Constitution** lays down inter alia that "no person shall be deprived of his life, liberty or property, without due process of law"

Under the concept of **'due process'**, the Courts become the arbiter of reasonableness of both substantive as well as procedural provisions in a law.

### Indian Position - Gopalan's View

It was contended in Gopalan that the expression 'procedure established by law' in Art. 21 was synonymous with the American concept of 'procedural due process' and, therefore, the reasonableness of the Preventive Detention Act, or for that matter, of any law affecting a person's life or personal liberty, should be justiciable.

**The Supreme Court rejected the contention giving several reasons:**

1. **Word 'Due' Absent:** First, the word 'due' was absent in Art. 21. This was a very significant omission for the entire efficacy of the procedural due process concept emanates from the word 'due'
2. **Drafting History:** Secondly, the draft constitution had contained the words 'due process of law' but these words were later dropped and the present phraseology adopted instead. This was strong evidence to show that the Constituent Assembly did not desire to introduce into India the concept of procedural due process
3. **Complexity Concerns:** If the doctrine of due process were imported into India then the doctrine of police power might also have to be imported which would make things very complicated

## What is 'Law' under Article 21?

The term 'law' in Art. 21 includes:
- A law made by a Legislature
- An ordinance is as much law
- The rules made by the Supreme Court are comprised within the term 'law' in Art. 21
- Rules made by the High Court under Art. 225 fall within the scope of Art. 21

---

## 'Procedure' under Article 21

It is now established **after Maneka Gandhi** that **'procedure' for purposes of Art. 21 has to be reasonable, fair and just**.

### Example

The procedure of putting a poor person in prison for failure to pay his debts is violative of Art. 21 "unless there is proof of the minimal fairness of his wilful failure to pay in spite of his sufficient means."

---

## Onus of Proof

**Presumption of innocence is a human right.** Article 21 in view of its expansive meaning not only protects life and liberty but also envisages a fair procedure.

From the point of view of the burden of proof, the Courts draw a distinction between:
- **Art. 14**, on the one hand
- **Arts. 19 and 21**, on the other

### For Articles 19 and 21

In a challenge under these provisions, once the petitioner shows that his right has been taken away, **it is for the State to justify the impugned law** by showing that:
- The restriction is reasonable (Art. 19), **OR**
- The procedure is not arbitrary but is just, fair and reasonable (Art. 21)

---

## Criminal Justice After Maneka Gandhi

Administration of criminal justice is a State matter. Fortunately, by reinterpreting Art. 21 in Maneka Gandhi, and by giving up the sterile approach of Gopalan, the Supreme Court has found a potent tool to seek to improve matters, and to fill in the vacuum arising from governmental inaction and apathy to undertake reform, in the area of criminal justice.

The Supreme Court has observed in **Sunil Batra II** that thanks to Art. 21, "human rights jurisprudence in India has a constitutional status and sweep... so that this magna carta may well toll the knell of human bondage beyond civilized limits".

---

## Investigation, Arrest and Trial

### Investigation

Article 21 envisages a fair trial, a fair procedure and a **fair investigation**. By reason of such a right alone the appellant was entitled not only to be informed about his fundamental right and statutory rights but it was obligatory on the part of the Special Public Prosecutor to place on record the requisite materials before the Designated Judge.

**Free and fair trial is sine qua non of Article 21.**

### Arrest

#### Case: Joginder Kumar v. State of Uttar Pradesh

The Apex Court has issued directions regarding arrest. The Court has emphasized that a police officer may have the power to arrest but **justification for exercising the power is quite another matter**.

**The arrested man has certain rights:**
- He has a right that a relative/friend of his be informed about his arrest and the place of his detention
- He has a right to consult a lawyer privately

### Fair Trial

Conducting a fair trial for those who are accused of criminal offences is the cornerstone of democracy. Conducting a fair trial is beneficial both to the accused as well as to the society. **A conviction resulting from an unfair trial is contrary to our concept of justice.**

Right to have a fair trial strictly in terms of the Juvenile Justice Act which would include procedural safeguard is a **Fundamental Right of the juvenile**.

---

## Speedy Trial

Where currency notes were recovered from the appellant in the year 1981 who was caught red-handed but charge-sheet was filed in 2007 during the pendency of petition filed in 1998 under S. 482 CrPC alleging undue harassment for eighteen years, the Court held that it was a **clear case of violation of fundamental rights of the accused** conferred by Art. 21 and the criminal case was liable to be quashed.

### Case: Abdul Rehman Antulay v. R.S. Naik

The Supreme Court has reiterated that there is a **right to speedy trial** of the case pending against him. But there can be no time limit within which a trial must be completed.

**"It is, thus, the obligation of the state or the complainant, as the case may be, to proceed with the case with reasonable promptitude."**

**Right to speedy trial flowing from Art. 21 encompasses all the stages**, namely, the stage of investigation, inquiry, trial, appeal, revision and re-trial.

---

## Long Pre-Trial Confinement

A very grievous aspect of the present-day administration of criminal justice is the **long pre-trial incarceration** of the accused persons. The poor persons have to languish in prisons awaiting trial because there is no one to post bail for them. This perpetrates great injustice on the accused person and jeopardizes his personal liberty.

**Imposing unjust or harsh conditions, while granting bail, is violative of Art. 21.**

Ordinarily, in cases under TADA, release of undertrials on bail is extremely restricted. But the Supreme Court has ruled that even in TADA cases, where there is no prospect of a trial being concluded within a reasonable time, release on bail may be necessary as this can be taken to be embedded in the right to speedy trial under Art. 21.

---

## Maximum Imprisonment

The Supreme Court has directed **release of all undertrials who have been in jail for periods longer than the maximum term of imprisonment**.

Continued detention clearly violates not only human dignity but also their Fundamental Right under Art. 21 of the Constitution.

---

## Right of Appeal

As a part of the concept of **'fair procedure'** in Article 21, the Supreme Court has emphasized that **one right of appeal from the Sessions Court to the High Court is essential** where criminal conviction is brought about with long loss of liberty.

---

## Legal Aid

The state should provide **free legal aid** to a prisoner who is indigent or otherwise disabled from securing legal assistance where the ends of justice call for such service.

### Case: Khatri v. State of Bihar (II)

The Supreme Court again emphasized that the State Governments cannot avoid their constitutional obligation to provide free legal service to the poor accused by pleading financial or administrative inability.

---

## Protection Against Police Action

### Handcuffing of Under-Trials

#### Case: Citizens for Democracy Through its President v. State of Assam

The Court has directed that **"handcuffs or other fetters shall not be forced on a prisoner-convicted or under-trial** while lodged in a jail anywhere in the country or while transporting or in transit from one jail to another or from jail to Court and back".

The police and jail authorities, on their own, shall have no authority to direct handcuffing of any one without the order of a magistrate for the purpose.

### Police Torture

#### Case: Sheela Barse

The Court has given directions to ensure **protection against torture and maltreatment of women in police lock-up**. For example:
- There should be separate lock-ups for female suspects guarded by female constables
- Interrogation of females should be carried out only in the presence of female constables

---

## Prison Administration

The Supreme Court has emphasized that **Arts. 14, 19 and 21 "are available to prisoners as well as freemen. Prison walls do not keep out Fundamental Rights"**.

### Case: Sunil Batra

The petitioner, sentenced to death on charges of murder and robbery, was being kept in solitary confinement pending his appeal before the High Court. He filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court under Art. 32.

The Court emphasised that **Article 21 means that "the law must be right, just and fair, and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive."**

### Prisoner's Grievances

#### Case: Charles Sobraj

The Court has ruled that it can intervene with prison administration when **constitutional rights or statutory prescriptions are transgressed** to the injury of the prisoner.

---

## Damages for Illegal Detention

### Case: Rudul Shah v. State of Bihar

In a precedent-setting judgment, the Supreme Court in a writ petition under Art. 32 awarded **Rs. 35,000 as compensation** against the State of Bihar to the petitioner because he was kept in jail for 14 years after he had been acquitted by a criminal Court.

---

## Custodial Violence

### Case: D.K. Basu v. State of West Bengal

Many a time, the police arrests a person without warrant in connection with the investigation of an offence, without recording his arrest. He is then subjected to torture to extract information from him for the purpose of carrying on further investigation. The torture and violence caused to the arrestee sometimes results in his death.

After making reference to several reports published on the matter, national and international, the Supreme Court has observed that **custodial violence strikes a blow at the rule of law**. Therefore, it becomes the sacred duty of the Court.

---

## Extended View of Article 21

### Quality of Life

Another broad formulation of the theme of life with dignity is to be found in **Bandhua Mukti Morcha**.

**Life with human dignity includes:**
- Protection of health and strength of workers, men and women
- Protection of the tender age of the children against abuse
- Opportunities and facilities for children to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity
- Educational facilities
- Just and human conditions of work
- Maternity relief

---

## Implied Rights from Article 21

### 1. Right to Livelihood

The Supreme Court has now implied the **'right to livelihood'** out of the 'right to life' in Art. 21.

#### Case: Olga Tellis

The Court has argued in Olga Tellis, a case which was brought by pavement dwellers to resist eviction from their habitat by the Bombay Municipal Corporation, that **the right to livelihood is born out of the right to life**, as no person can live without the means of living, that is, the means of livelihood.

### 2. Sexual Harassment

#### Case: Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan

The Supreme Court has declared **sexual harassment of a working woman at her place of work** as amounting to violation of rights of gender equality and right to life and liberty which is a clear violation of Arts. 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution.

### 3. Protection Against Rape

**Rape has been held to be a violation of a person's Fundamental Right** guaranteed under Art. 21.

**"Right to Life"** means **"the Right to live with human dignity"**. "Right to 'life' would, therefore, include all those aspects of life which go to make a life meaningful, complete and worth living."

### 4. Right to Privacy

The Supreme Court has asserted that in recent times the **right to privacy has acquired constitutional status**; it is **"implicit in the right to life and liberty guaranteed to the citizens"** by Art. 21.

### 5. Tapping of Telephone

The power of telephone tapping has now become a **regulated power** both procedurally and substantively.

### 6. Right to Environment

The Court also referred to many of its earlier judgments and in particular to **M. C. Mehta**, and the **public trust doctrine** based on the principle that certain resources like air, sea, water and forests are of such importance to the people as a whole that it would be wholly unjustified to make them a subject of private ownership.

---

## Right to Die

### Case: Gian Kaur

The Supreme Court has distinguished between **euthanasia** and **attempt to commit suicide**.

**Euthanasia** is termination of life of a person who is terminally ill, or in a persistent vegetative state. In such a case, death due to termination of natural life is certain and imminent.

---

## Conclusion

**The march of Art. 21 still continues.** The frontiers of Art. 21 are still expanding and its new dimensions are still being explored by the Courts.

It is quite possible that, in course of time, the Courts may possibly be able to imply some more rights for the people out of Art. 21 because **the concept of a 'dignified life' guaranteed by Art. 21 seems to be inexhaustible in range and scope**.

It is left to the ingenuity of the Courts to explore this concept to the extent they can in the Indian social context.
