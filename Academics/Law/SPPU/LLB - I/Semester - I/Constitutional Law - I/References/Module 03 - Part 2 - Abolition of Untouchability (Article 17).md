# Module 03 - Part 2: Abolition of Untouchability (Article 17)

## Introduction

**Article 17** abolishes untouchability and forbids its practice in any form.

The enforcement of any disability arising out of "untouchability" is to be an offence punishable in accordance with law.

**Abolition of untouchability in itself is complete and its effect is all pervading applicable to state action as well as acts or omissions by individuals, institutions or juristic body of persons.**

---

## Main Object of Article 17

The main object of Art. 17 is to **ban the practice of untouchability in any form**.

---

## Background and Legislative Framework

To give effect to Art. 17, Parliament enacted the **Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955**, prescribing punishments for practising untouchability in various forms.

In **1976**, the Act was renamed as the **"Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955"**.

### Definition

The word **"untouchability"** has not been defined either in the Constitution or in the Act, because it is not capable of any precise definition.

## Judicial Interpretation

### Case: Pavadai v. State of Madras, AIR 1973

The State Legislature passed a law to improve the conditions of living of untouchables. Accordingly, the Act provided for acquisition of land for constructing a colony for them. It was argued against the validity of the law that the construction of a colony would not be in conformity with Art. 17.

**The Madras High Court rejected the argument.**

The Court also referred to **Art. 15(4)** in this connection.

## Article 15(4) - Constitutional Amendment of 1951

To tide over the difficulties created by such decisions in the way of helping backward classes by making discriminatory provisions in their favour, **Art. 15(4) was added to the Constitution in 1951**.

**Art. 15(4)** says that the state is not prevented from making any special provisions for:
- "The advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens, **OR**
- For the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes"

## Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989

This Act was enacted with the following objectives:

1. **To prevent the commission of atrocities** against the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes
2. **To provide for setting up of special Courts** for the trial of offences under the Act
3. **To provide for the relief and rehabilitation** of victims of such offences

### Case: Jai Singh v. Union of India, AIR 1993

The Supreme Court observed:

> "Despite various measures to improve the socio-economic conditions of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, they remain vulnerable. They are denied number of civil rights. They are subjected to various offences, indignities, humiliations and harassment. They have, in several brutal incidents, been deprived of their life and property. Serious crimes are committed against them for various historical, social and economic reasons…."

## Article 15(2) and Eradication of Untouchability

**Art. 15(2)** also helps in the eradication of untouchability, as no person shall, on the grounds only of **"religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them"**, be denied access to shops, etc., as mentioned therein.

---

## Horizontal Application

While the Fundamental Rights, generally speaking, are restrictions mainly on government activities, **Arts. 17 and 15(2) protect an individual from discriminatory conduct not only on the part of the state but even on the part of private persons in certain situations.**

The Supreme Court has stated that whenever any Fundamental Right like Art. 17 is violated by a private individual, it is the constitutional obligation of the state to take the necessary steps for the purpose of interdicting such violation and ensuring observance of the Fundamental Right by the private individual who is transgressing the same.

**The state is under a constitutional obligation to see that there is no violation of the Fundamental Right of such person.**

---

## Directive Principles

The Directive Principles, especially **Arts. 38 and 46**, obligate the state to render socio-economic and political justice to Dalits and improve the quality of their life.
