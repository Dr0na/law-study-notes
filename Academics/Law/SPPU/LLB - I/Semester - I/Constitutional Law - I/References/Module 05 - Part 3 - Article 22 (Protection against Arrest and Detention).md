# Module 05 - Part 3: Article 22 (Protection against Arrest and Detention)

## Introduction

The protection of the individual from oppression and abuse by the police and other enforcement officers is a major interest in a free society. Arrest and detention in police lock-up may be very traumatic for a person. It can cause him incalculable harm by way of loss of his reputation.

**Denying a person of his liberty is a serious matter.**

### Case: Joginder Kumar v. State of Uttar Pradesh

The Supreme Court has clarified that **no arrest can be made because it is lawful for the police officer to do so**. The existence of the power of arrest is one thing, the justification for its exercise is quite another.

**Art. 22 guarantees the minimum rights which any person who is arrested will enjoy.**

## Four Safeguards for Arrested Persons

Clauses **(1) and (2) of Art. 22** ensure the following four safeguards for a person who is arrested:

### Rule 1: Information About Grounds
He is not to be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds of his arrest.

### Rule 2: Right to Legal Consultation
He shall not be denied the right to consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice.

### Rule 3: Production Before Magistrate
A person arrested and detained in custody is to be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of **twenty-four hours** of his arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the magistrate's court.

### Rule 4: No Detention Beyond 24 Hours
No such person is to be detained in custody beyond this period without the authority of a magistrate.

**Important Note:** It may also be noted that when a person is arrested, Art. 21 also is activated. On such matters on which Art. 22 is silent, recourse may be had to Art. 21. Art. 22 advances in a way the purpose of Art. 21 insofar as it specifies some guaranteed rights available to persons arrested or detained.

---

## Rule 1: Information About Grounds of Arrest

Information about the grounds of arrest is **mandatory** under Art. 22(1).

### Case: Shobharam

The Supreme Court has said: **"In other words, a person's personal liberty cannot be curtailed by arrest without informing him, as soon as is possible, why he is arrested"**.

**Requirements:**
- The grounds given to the arrested person should be **intelligible**
- The reason behind the rule requiring communication of grounds to the person arrested is to enable him to prepare his defence, and to move the court for bail, or for a writ of habeas corpus

---

## Rule 2: Right to Consult a Lawyer

The Supreme Court has observed that the arrested person has a right, upon request, to:
- Have someone informed
- Consult privately with a lawyer

**These rights are inherent in Arts. 21 and 22(2) of the Constitution.**

The right to consult a legal practitioner **starts right from the day of arrest**.

The right against self-incrimination is best promoted by conceding to the accused the right to consult a legal practitioner of his choice. **Reading Arts. 20(3) and 22(1) together.**

---

## Rule 3: Production Before a Magistrate

Requires an arrested person to be produced before a magistrate within **24 hours** of his arrest.

### Example

A station officer arrested a person without a warrant on his own authority. Within a few minutes, the city magistrate came there in his executive capacity. The arrested person was produced before him and he remanded him to jail custody.

**Art. 22(2) was held to have been fulfilled** as the arrest had not been made under the orders or supervision of the magistrate before whom the arrested person was produced. It is immaterial whether the magistrate sits in a Court or not at the time the arrested person is produced before him.

---

## Rule 4: No Detention Beyond 24 Hours Without Magistrate's Authority

### Case: Gunpati v. Nafisul Hasan

A person was arrested in Bombay on a warrant issued by the Speaker of the U.P. Legislative Assembly and was taken to Lucknow in custody to be produced before the Speaker to answer a charge of breach of privilege of the House. He was not produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of his arrest.

The Supreme Court held that this was a **clear breach of the peremptory provisions of Art. 22(2)** and hence the petitioner was released.

---

## Non-Application of Articles 22(1) & 22(2)

These protections do **NOT apply** to:
- (a) Enemy aliens, **AND**
- (b) Persons arrested or detained under a law providing for preventive detention

### Child Detention

When a 13 year old boy was taken into custody against his will and kept imprisoned for several days although there was no case, cognizable or non-cognizable against him, the Delhi High Court held he had been **arrested and detained in custody within the meaning of Art. 22**.

---

## Preventive Detention

### Definition

**Preventive detention** means detention of a person without trial and conviction by a court, but merely on suspicion in the mind of an executive authority.

Preventive detention is fundamentally and qualitatively different from imprisonment after trial and conviction in a criminal court.

### Distinction Between Conviction and Preventive Detention

| Conviction | Preventive Detention |
|------------|---------------------|
| An accused is sought to be punished for a **past act** | A person is detained without trial to prevent him from committing an **undesirable act in future** |
| The offence has to be proved in the court beyond reasonable doubt | Based on subjective satisfaction of the executive |
| Purpose: **Punishment** | Purpose: **Prevention** |

**"In preventive detention, the past act is merely the material for inference about the future course of probable conduct on the part of the detenu."**

---

## Constitutional Provisions for Preventive Detention

### Parliamentary Power - Entry 9, List I

A law for preventive detention can be enacted by Parliament **exclusively** under entry 9, List I, for reasons connected with:
- Defence
- Foreign affairs, **OR**
- Security of India

### Concurrent Power - Entry 3, List III

Under entry 3, List III, **Parliament as well as the State Legislatures** can concurrently make a law for preventive detention for reasons connected with:
- Security of a State
- Maintenance of public order, **OR**
- Maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community

---

## Rights of Detenu - Article 22(5)

### Communication of Grounds to the Detenu

These are the rights granted to the detenu by Art. 22(5). **If any of these rights is violated, the detention order would become bad.**

Under Art. 22(5), communication of grounds means **communication to the detenu of all the basic facts, documents and materials** which went into the subjective satisfaction of the authority to detain him.

### Right to Make Representation

The detenu should be placed in a position so that he can make an **effective representation** against his detention and he cannot do so unless the grounds of detention are communicated to him in clear and unambiguous terms giving as much particulars as possible.

#### Language Issue

Grounds were served on a detenu in the English language which he did not know. He asked for a Hindi version of the grounds which was not supplied to him. **The Supreme Court quashed his detention.**

### Consideration of the Representation

Art. 22(5) does not say as to whom the representation is to be made, or, what is to be done with it. However, in order to make Art. 22(5) meaningful and convert it into a safeguard to the detenu, the Supreme Court has interpreted Art. 22(5) to mean that **the government must consider the detenu's representation before sending it to the advisory board**.

This consideration of representation by the detaining authority is independent of the reference to the Advisory Board.

#### Example

The order of preventive detention was made by the Home Minister, but the detenu's representation was rejected by the Secretary. The Supreme Court held that the Secretary had no jurisdiction to do so and that the detenu's further detention became invalid.

---

## Advisory Board - Article 22(4)

Another safeguard is provided by Art. 22(4) to a detenu under preventive detention.

Under **Art. 22(4)(a)**, preventive detention for over **three months** is possible only when an advisory board holds that, in its opinion, there is sufficient cause for such detention.

**The board must report before the expiry of three months.** If the report is not made within three months of the date of detention, the detention would become illegal.

### Confirmation of the Detention Order

While confirming the order of detention, the government has not only to peruse the report of the advisory board, but **apply its mind to the material on record**.

### Parliament's Power to Dispense with Advisory Boards

Under **Art. 22(7)(a)**, Parliament may by law prescribe "the circumstances under which, and the class or classes of cases in which, a person may be detained for a period longer than three months" without referring his case to an advisory board under Art. 22(4)(a).

---

## Maximum Period of Detention

This provision has been held to be merely **permissive**, and it does not oblige Parliament to prescribe any maximum period of detention.

It has also been held that it is not necessary for Parliament to fix the maximum period for detention in terms of years, months or days. It is valid to fix such period in terms of a **specific event**, as for example, until the expiry of the emergency proclaimed under Art. 352.

---

## Laws Authorising Preventive Detention

### Central Laws

#### (a) National Security Act (NSA), 1980

Immediately after the inauguration of the Constitution, Parliament enacted the **Preventive Detention Act, 1950**. It was deemed to be a temporary measure but it remained in operation till December 31, 1969, when it was allowed to expire. It was this Act which gave rise to the famous (or, now infamous) Gopalan case.

Then was enacted the **Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971, (MISA)**. This Act lasted until 1977.

Thereafter, Parliament enacted the **National Security Act, 1980, (NSA)**. This is the prevailing law on preventive detention.

**Note:** The provisions of the Act of 1950 were rather severe, but, with the passage of time, the law of preventive detention has been somewhat liberalised, especially, in its procedural aspects, with a view to give better safeguards to the detenu.

##### Grounds for Detention under NSA

To prevent him from acting in any manner prejudicial to:
- The defence of India
- The relations of India with foreign powers
- Security of India
- Security of a State
- Maintenance of public order, **OR**
- The maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community

#### (b) COFEPOSA Act, 1974

Besides NSA, Parliament has also enacted the **Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974, (COFEPOSA)**.

This Act provides for preventive detention with a view to:
- Prevent smuggling, **AND**
- Prevent any one from acting in a manner prejudicial to conserving and augmenting foreign exchange

Most of its provisions are similar to NSA.

#### (c) PBMSECA, 1980

In addition to the above mentioned two statutes, Parliament has also enacted the **Prevention of Black marketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 1980 (PBMSECA)**.

The Act authorises the Central or State Government to make an order detaining a person with a view to:
- Prevent him from committing black marketing, **AND**
- From acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies of commodities essential to the community

---

### State Laws

Besides the Central Acts mentioned above, there are several **State statutes** authorising preventive detention for various purposes:

- The Tamil Nadu Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers, Drug Offenders, Forest Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders and Slum Grabbers Act, 1982
- The Gujarat Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act, 1985
- The Bihar Control of Crimes Act, 1981
- The Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Slumlords, Bootleggers, Drug Offenders And Dangerous Persons Act, 1981
- The Andhra Pradesh Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers, Dacoits, Drug Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders and Land Grabbers Act, 1986

---

## Judicial Review of Orders of Preventive Detention

The law of preventive detention has been so designed as to leave a very broad discretion with administrative authorities to order preventive detention of a person, and leave only a **narrow margin for judicial review**.

### Grounds for Judicial Intervention

1. The Courts quash an order of detention if **mala fides** of the detaining authority are established
2. A detention order is bad if it is based on a **non-existent ground**
3. Under Art. 21, a person may not be deprived of his personal liberty except only in accordance with the procedure established by law
4. Therefore, in a matter of preventive detention, the Administration must follow **scrupulously and strictly the procedural norms** laid down in clauses 4 to 7 of Art. 22

---

## Concluding Remarks

Preventive detention has been operative in India since 1950, barring brief respites. There does not appear to be any prospect of the law being withdrawn in the near future.

**The rigours of preventive detention as it operates in India thus need to be softened by providing some more safeguards to the detenu.**
