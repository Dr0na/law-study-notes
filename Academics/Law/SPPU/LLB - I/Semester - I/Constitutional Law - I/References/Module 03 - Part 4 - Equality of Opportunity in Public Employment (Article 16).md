# Module 03 - Part 4: Equality of Opportunity in Matters of Public Employment (Article 16)

## Introduction

**Article 16(1)** is a facet of Art. 14. Arts. 14 and 16(1) are closely interconnected.

### Distinction Between Articles 14 and 16

- **Art. 14** applies to all persons, citizens as well as non-citizens
- **Art. 16** applies only to citizens and not to non-citizens

---

## Article 16(1) - Equality of Opportunity

Article 16(1) guarantees **equality of opportunity** to all citizens "in matters relating to employment" or "appointment to any office" under the state.

## Article 16(2) - Non-Discrimination

According to Art. 16(2), no citizen can be discriminated against, or be ineligible for any employment or office under the state, on the grounds only of:
- Religion
- Race
- Caste
- Sex
- Descent
- Place of birth
- Residence
- Any of them

---

## Comparison: Article 15 vs Article 16

| # | Article 15(1) | Article 16(2) |
|---|---------------|---------------|
| 1 | Narrower - covers the entire range of state activities | Somewhat wider - public employment only |
| 2 | Does not mention 'descent' and 'residence' | Prohibits discrimination on the additional grounds of descent and residence |

**Articles 16(1) and 16(2) give effect to Arts. 14 and 15. All these Articles form part of the same constitutional code of guarantees and supplement each other.**

---

## Scope and Application

The protection of Arts. 14 and 16 is available even to a **temporary government servant** if he has been arbitrarily discriminated against and singled out for harsh treatment in preference to his juniors, similarly circumstanced.

As under Art. 14, so under Art. 16, equality cannot be a mathematical equality. **Reasonable classification is permissible** for various purposes relating to employment.

**The onus to establish discrimination is on him who asserts it.**

---

## Matters of Employment

### Service Conditions

Under **Art. 309**, rules regulating service conditions of government servants can be made by the government, but such rules have to stand the tests of Arts. 14 and 16 and, thus, have to be reasonable and fair and not grossly unjust.

---

## Specific Employment Issues

### 1. Seniority

Difficult questions arise from time to time regarding fixation of inter se seniority in a cadre.

**Important Principles:**
- Seniority is governed by service rules
- No one has a vested right to seniority but an employee has an interest in seniority acquired by working out the rules
- It can be taken away only by operation of a valid law
- **Seniority is not a Fundamental Right. It is merely a civil right**
- Article 16 is applicable in the case of an appointment. It does not speak of fixation of seniority
- Unilateral change of status of its employee by an instrumentality of the State is arbitrary violating Arts. 14 and 16

#### Case: Reserve Bank of India v. N.C. Paliwal, AIR 1976

The rule-making authority can determine with objectivity and fairness what rules should govern the inter se seniority. The rules ought not to be arbitrary and irrational resulting in inequality of opportunity amongst employees belonging to the same class.

---

### 2. Appointment

#### Case: Nagpur Improvement Trust v. Yadaorao Jagannath Kumbhare, (1999)

Appointments can be made under executive power if no statutory service rules have been made.

#### Case: State of Orissa v. S. Mohapatra, (1993)

Appointments made in violation of the rules infringe Arts. 14 and 16 and, as such, the government cannot later regularise them.

#### Case: State of Maharashtra v. Raj Kumar

There should be reasonable relation between the prescribed test for suitability of the candidate and the post as such.

#### Case: State of Jammu & Kashmir v. Shiv Ram Sharma, AIR 1999

It is permissible for the government to prescribe appropriate qualifications for appointment or promotion to various posts. Qualifications for a particular post can be a **"rational differentia"** within the meaning of Art. 16.

Prescription of stenographic ability of 100 words per minute is a relevant qualification.

#### Case: Javed Niaz Beg v. Union of India, AIR 1981

For the combined competitive examination—civil services examination, 1979, the candidates hailing from the Eastern States (Mizoram, Meghalaya, Nagaland etc.) were given an option to take or not to take the paper on Indian languages.

This was held to be **non-discriminatory** as these States have handicaps in the matter of language.

---

### 3. Compassionate Appointment

Appointment on compassionate grounds of a son, daughter or widow to assist the family to relieve economic distress because of the sudden demise in harness of a government servant has been held to be valid vis-a-vis Arts. 16(1) and 16(2).

**Key Principles:**
- Appointment in public services on compassionate ground has been carved out, as an exception, in the interests of justice
- Such an appointment is to be made according to the rules and guidelines that may have been framed by the concerned authority
- **No such appointment can be made if no post is available**

#### Case: Indian Bank v. K. Usha, AIR 1998

If a vacancy is available, such an appointment should be made as soon as possible. **"It is improper to keep such case pending for years."**

---

### 4. Promotion

**No employee has a vested right to promotion** but he certainly has the right to be considered for promotion according to the rules.

**Important Principles:**
- Chances of promotion are not conditions of service and are defeasible by law
- The government can formulate or change the policy regarding promotions but the policy must conform to the principle of equality

#### Case: All India Station-Masters' Ass. v. Gen. Manager, C. Rly., AIR 1960

The railways provide the guards with a better channel of promotion to higher grade station-masters than to the roadside station-masters.

This is **not discriminatory** as the guards and the station-masters belong to separate categories with separate avenues of promotion. 'Equality' under Art. 16 means equality as between members of the same class of employees and not equality between members of separate, independent classes.

#### Case: T.R. Kothandaraman v. Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board, (1994)

The Supreme Court has reiterated that **higher educational qualification is a permissible basis of classification** but the acceptability thereof will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.

---

### 5. Compulsory Retirement

Provision for compulsory retirement of government servants in public interest does not infringe Arts. 14 and 16. These Articles do not prohibit the prescription of reasonable rules for compulsory retirement which neither involves any civil consequences, nor any stigma.

---

### 6. Retirement

The expression **"conditions of service"** would take within its fold, fixation of the age of superannuation. Therefore, service rules made under Art. 309 may revise and reduce the age of retirement.

#### Case: K. Nagaraj v. State of Andhra Pradesh, AIR 1985

The age of superannuation was reduced from 58 to 55 years by amending the service rules. The Supreme Court ruled that service rules can be amended under Art. 309.

---

### 7. Termination

There should be no discrimination in the matter of termination of service. Dismissal of a person on the sole ground that he is a **'non-Andhra'** was held void as amounting to discrimination only on the ground of place of birth which is prohibited by Art. 16(2).

---

### 8. Transfer

An order of transfer of an employee is a part of the service conditions. The Court does not interfere with such an order unless:
- It is mala fide, **OR**
- The service rules prohibit such an order, **OR**
- The authority issuing the order was not competent to do so

A government employee, or a servant of a public undertaking, has **no legal right to insist for being posted at any particular place** unless specifically provided in his service conditions.

#### Case: Arvind Dattatraya Dhande v. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1997

When an honest officer was transferred by the Government because of the pressure of vested interests, the Supreme Court quashed the same characterising it as **mala fide**, a case of "victimisation of an honest officer" and not in public interest.

---

## Exceptions to Articles 16(1) & 16(2)

The right of equality guaranteed by Arts. 16(1) and (2) are subject to a few exceptions.

### Exception 1: Article 16(3) - Residential Qualification

Under **Art. 16(3)**, Parliament may make a law to prescribe a requirement as to residence within a State or Union Territory for eligibility to be appointed with respect to specified classes of appointments or posts.

Thus, Art. 16(2) which bans discrimination of citizens on the ground of 'residence' only in respect of any office or employment under the state, can be qualified as regards residence, and a **'residential qualification'** imposed on the right of appointment in the State for specified appointments.

**Power has been given to Parliament and not to the State Legislatures** to relax the principle of non-discrimination.

Under Art. 16(3), Parliament has enacted the **Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957**.

#### Case: A.V.S. Narasimha Rao v. State of Andhra Pradesh

The Supreme Court declared that part of the Act unconstitutional which prescribed a residence qualification for government services in Telangana—a part of the State of Andhra Pradesh.

The Court took the view that under Art. 16(3), Parliament can impose a residential qualification for services in the whole State, but not in a part of the State.

---

### Exception 2: Article 16(4) - Reservations in Services

**Art. 16(4)** constitutes a very significant exception to the principle of equality embodied in Art. 16(1).

## Reservations in Services: Article 16(4)

Under **Art. 16(4)**, the state may make reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any **'backward class'** of citizens which, in the opinion of the state, is not adequately represented in the public services under the state.

The term **'state'** denotes both the Central and the State Governments and their instrumentalities.

---

## Nature of Article 16(4)

### Case: Mohan Kumar Singhania v. Union of India AIR 1992

The Supreme Court has stated that it is **"an enabling provision"** conferring a discretionary power on the state for making any provision or reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the state, is not adequately represented in the service of the state.

**Art. 16(4) neither imposes any constitutional duty nor confers any Fundamental Right on any one for claiming reservation.**

**Key Points:**
- The equality of opportunity guaranteed by Art. 16(1) is to each individual citizen of the country
- Art. 16(4) contemplates special provision being made in favour of the socially disadvantaged classes

---

## Definition of 'Backward Class'

The term **'Backward Class'**, as used in Art. 16(4), takes within its fold Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

**Art. 15(4)** speaks about **"socially and educationally backward classes of citizens"**.

**Art. 16(4)** speaks only of **"any backward class of citizens."**

However, it has been settled by a series of judicial pronouncements that the expression **"backward class of citizens"** in Art. 16(4) means the same thing as the expression **"any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens"** in Art. 15(4).

**Thus, to qualify for being called a 'backward class citizen' under Art. 16(4), one must be a member of a 'socially and educationally backward class'.**

---

## Discretionary Nature

Article 16(4):
- Neither confers a right on anyone to claim
- Nor imposes a constitutional duty on the government to make
- Any reservation for any one in public services

It is merely an **enabling provision** and confers a discretionary power on the state to reserve posts in favour of backward classes of citizens, which, in its opinion, are not adequately represented in the state services.

---

## Reservation in Promotions

### Case: General Manager, Southern Rly. v. Rangachari, AIR 1962

The validity of the circulars issued by the Railway Administration providing for reservation in favour of the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes in promotions (by selection) was questioned.

**The Supreme Court ruled** that under Art. 16(4), reservation in government services can be made **not only at the initial stage of recruitment, but even in the matter of promotion** from a lower to a higher post or cadre.

**Thus, selection posts can also be reserved for backward classes.**

---

## Quantum of Reservation

### Case: Balaji v. State of Mysore, AIR 1963

While striking down as unconstitutional a government order by which **68% of the seats** in educational institutions were reserved for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other Backward Classes on the ground of excessive reservation and as a fraud on the Constitution.

**The Court stated:** "Speaking generally and in a broad way, a special provision should be less than 50 per cent; how much less than 50 per cent would depend upon the relevant prevailing circumstances in each case."

---

## Carry Forward Rule

### Case: T. Devadasan v. Union of India, AIR 1964

The 'carry forward' rule envisaged that:
- In a year, 17½ per cent posts were to be reserved for Scheduled Castes/Tribes
- If all the reserved posts were not filled in a year for want of suitable candidates from those classes, then the shortfall was to be carried forward to the next year and added to the reserved quota for that year
- This could be done for the next two years

**The result** of the rule was that in a year out of 45 vacancies in the cadre of section officers, 29 went to the reserved quota and only 16 posts were left for others. This meant reservation upto **65% in the third year**, and while candidates with low marks from the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were appointed, candidates with higher marks from other classes were not taken.

**Basing itself on the Balaji principle, the Supreme Court declared that more than 50 per cent reservation of posts in a single year would be unconstitutional.**

The Supreme Court has observed that Art. 16(4) is an enabling provision and the reservation thereunder should not exceed legitimate limits. In making reservations for the backward classes, the State cannot ignore the Fundamental Rights of the rest of the citizens.

---

## State of Kerala v. N.M. Thomas AIR 1976

### Facts

The Kerala Government made rules to say that promotion from the cadre of lower division clerks to the higher cadre of upper division clerks depended on passing a test within two years. For S/Cs and S/Ts, exemption could be granted for a longer period. These classes were given two extra years to pass the test.

This exemption was challenged as discriminatory under Art. 16(1).

### Decision

The Supreme Court held that it was permissible to give **preferential treatment to Scheduled Castes/Tribes under Art. 16(1) outside Art. 16(4)**.

**Thomas marks the beginning of a new judicial thinking on Art. 16 and leads to greater concessions to S/C, S/T and other backward persons.**

---

## After Thomas - Expanded Approach

### Case: A.B.S.K. Sangh (Rly.) v. Union of India, AIR 1981

Reservation in selection posts in railways for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was held valid.

**Key Holdings:**
- The quantum of reservation **(17½%)** in railway services for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was held not excessive
- The field of eligibility was not too unreasonable
- **The 'carry forward' rule for three years was held not bad**

### Distinction from Devadasan Case

In the Devadasan case, the 'carry forward' rule for backward classes was struck down as it far exceeded 50%.

In the instant case, under the carry forward rule, the quota for Scheduled Castes/Tribes could go up to a maximum of **66% of posts**. **This was upheld.**

### Rationale

**Article 16(2) expressly forbids discrimination on the basis of 'caste'.** Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are not castes within the ordinary meaning of caste. These are backward human groups. There is a great divide between these persons and the rest of the community. As Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes suffer from socio-economic backward status.

---

## What Are Backward Classes?

### Case: K.C. Vasanth Kumar v. State of Karnataka AIR 1985

The Karnataka Government wanted to appoint a commission to go into this question and the Government requested the Court to lay down guidelines.

**Five Judges participating in the decision wrote five separate opinions:**

#### Opinion 1: CHANDRACHUD, C.J.
They should satisfy the test of economic backwardness, laid down by the State Govt.

#### Opinion 2: DESAI, J.
The only criterion which can be realistically devised is the one of economic backwardness.

#### Opinion 3: CHINNAPPA REDDY, J.
"Poverty, caste, occupation and habitation are the principal factors contributing to social backwardness".

#### Opinion 4: SEN, J.
"The predominant and the only factor for making special provisions under Art. 15(4) or for reservation of posts and appointments under Art. 16(4) should be poverty, and caste or a sub-caste or a group should be used only for purposes of identification of persons comparable to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes".

#### Opinion 5: VENKATARAMIAH, J.
Stressed upon the relevance of caste factor as an index of backwardness.

---

## The Mandal Commission Case

### Case: Indra Sawhney v. Union of India AIR 1993

This is a very significant pronouncement of the Supreme Court on the question of reservation of posts for backward classes.

### Background

- The **Mandal Commission** was appointed by the Government of India in terms of Art. 340 of the Constitution in 1979 to investigate the conditions of socially and educationally backward classes
- One of the major recommendations made by the Commission was that, besides the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs), for **Other Backward Classes (OBCs)** which constitute nearly 52% component of the population, **27% government jobs be reserved** so that the total reservation for all, SCs, STs and OBCs, amounts to 50%
- No action was taken on the basis of the Mandal Report for long after it was submitted, except that it was discussed in the Houses of Parliament twice, once in 1982 and again in 1983
- On **Aug. 13, 1990**, the V.P. Singh Government at the centre issued an office memorandum accepting the Mandal Commission recommendation and announcing 27% reservation for the socially and educationally backward classes in vacancies in civil posts and services under the Government of India
- This memorandum led to widespread disturbances in the country
- In **1991**, the Narasimha Rao Government modified the above memorandum in two respects:
  1. The total reservation cannot exceed 50% in any one year
  2. Within the OBC quota, preference to be given to poorer sections

---

## After Indra Sawhney - Caste Factor

The Court has not been able to completely eliminate the caste factor in identifying the backward classes. However, the Court has sought to keep the caste factor within limits.

**Caste can be one of the factors, but not the sole factor, to assess backwardness.**

---

## Creamy Layer

In the Mandal case, the Supreme Court has clearly and authoritatively laid down that the **"socially" advanced members of a backward class, the "creamy layer", has to be excluded** from the backward class and the benefit of reservation under Art. 16(4) can only be given to the "class" which remains after the exclusion of the 'creamy layer'.

This would more appropriately serve the purpose and object of Art. 16(4).

---

## Article 16(3) - Residential Qualification (Revisited)

Power has been given to Parliament and not to the State Legislatures to relax the principle of non-discrimination. Under Art. 16(3), Parliament has enacted the **Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957**.
