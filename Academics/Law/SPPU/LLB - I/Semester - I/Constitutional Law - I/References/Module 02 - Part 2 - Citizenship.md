# Module 02 - Part 2: Citizenship of India

## Constitutional Provisions (Articles 5 to 11)

Though India is a Federation having two levels of government—Centre and the States—there is only **single citizenship**, viz., the Indian citizenship, and no separate State citizenship.

Articles 5 to 11 in the Constitution lay down as to who are the citizens of India at the commencement of the Constitution, i.e., on **January 26, 1950**. These citizens have been classified into:

- Citizens by domicile
- Citizens by migration
- Citizens by registration

---

## 1. Citizens by Domicile

Under **Art. 5**, every person having domicile in India at the commencement of the Constitution, and fulfilling any of the following conditions, is a citizen of India, viz,:

- (a) he was born in India
- (b) either of whose parents was born in India
- (c) who has been ordinarily resident in India for not less than five years immediately preceding the commencement of the Constitution

**Note:** Conditions (a), (b) and (c) are not cumulative but alternative and, therefore, any one of them needs to be fulfilled by a person having domicile in India to be an Indian citizen.

### Concept of Domicile

The term **'domicile'** is not defined in the Constitution.

The basic idea of 'domicile' is **permanent home**. A person's domicile is the country which is considered by law to be his permanent home. Residence in the country, and the intention to make it his home are necessary to constitute a domicile.

As the Supreme Court has observed in **Central Bank of India v. Ram Narain**, an intention to reside for ever in a country where one has taken up his residence is an essential constituent element for the existence of domicile in that country.

**Important Rules:**
- A minor takes the domicile of his father
- A married woman takes the domicile of her husband
- India has one citizenship only and no separate State citizenship

---

## 2. Citizens by Migration

The Independence of India was accompanied by a large scale migration of people from Pakistan. As these people belonged to the territory which ceased to be a part of India after the Independence, they could not be regarded as Indian citizens under Art. 5 and, therefore, special provisions had to be made for them in the Constitution.

Under **Art. 6**, an immigrant from Pakistan became a citizen of India if he, or either of his parents, or any of his grandparents, was born in India (as it was prior to the Independence), and, in addition, fulfilled either of the following two conditions:

1. In case he migrated to India **before July 19, 1948**, he had been ordinarily resident in India since the date of his migration; **OR**
2. In case he migrated **on or after July 19, 1948**, he had been registered as a citizen of India

**Note:** A person could be so registered only if he had been resident in India for at least six months preceding the date of his application for registration.

The migration envisaged in Art. 6 only means coming to India from outside and it must have taken place before, and not after, the commencement of the Constitution.

---

## 3. Citizens by Registration

According to **Art. 8**, a person who, or either of whose parents, or any of whose grandparents, was born in India (before independence) but who is ordinarily residing in any country outside India and Pakistan, may register himself as a citizen of India with the diplomatic or consular representative of India in the country of residence.

This provision confers Indian citizenship on a person who prima facie has no domicile in India and it seeks to cover the **overseas Indians** who may want to acquire Indian citizenship.

---

## 4. Termination of Citizenship

Under **Art. 7**, a citizen of India by domicile (Art. 5), or by migration (Art. 6), ceases to be citizen if he has migrated to Pakistan after **March 1, 1947**.

If, however, after migration to Pakistan, he has returned to India under a permit of resettlement, or permanent return, he can register himself as a citizen of India in the same manner as a person migrating from Pakistan after July 19, 1948.

**Important Points:**
- Article 7 thus overrides Arts. 5 and 6
- Art. 7 envisages only those persons who migrated to Pakistan between March 1, 1947, and January 26, 1950
- These persons lost their Indian citizenship
- The question of citizenship of persons migrating to Pakistan after January 26, 1950, has to be decided under the provisions of the Indian Citizenship Act

**Note:** A woman born and domiciled in India, going to Pakistan after March 1, 1947, would lose her Indian citizenship under Art. 7, even though her husband remained in India.

---

## 5. Dual Citizenship

Under **Art. 9**, no person can be a citizen of India under Arts. 5, 6 and 8, if he has voluntarily acquired the citizenship of a foreign country.

This provision thus recognises the principle that **no Indian citizen can claim a dual or plural citizenship**. However, this is subject to Parliament's power under Art. 11 to provide for inter alia, the acquisition of citizenship.

Article 9 thus applies only to those cases where foreign citizenship had been acquired before, and not after, the commencement of the Constitution. The latter type of situation has been dealt with under the provisions of the Indian Citizenship Act, 1955.

---

## The Citizenship Act, 1955

The above-mentioned provisions of the Constitution regarding citizenship are not exhaustive but fragmentary and skeletal. These provisions are confined mainly to defining who are citizens of India at the commencement of the Constitution but do not deal with the problem of acquisition of citizenship subsequent to that date. Nor is there any provision in the Constitution to deal with such matters as termination of citizenship (other than Arts. 7 and 9), or other matters concerning citizenship.

**Art. 11** expressly empowers Parliament to make a law to provide for such matters and, accordingly, Parliament has enacted the **Citizenship Act, 1955**, to provide for the acquisition and determination of Indian citizenship.

**Art. 10** says that a person who is a citizen of India under Arts. 5 to 8 shall, subject to any law made by Parliament, continue to be such citizen. This means that the law enacted by Parliament can make changes even in Arts. 5 to 8.

Parliament has exclusive power to legislate with respect to **"citizenship"**.

**Note:** The Act does not apply to a company, association or body of individuals whether incorporated or not.

### Five Ways of Acquiring Indian Citizenship

The Act provides for five ways for acquiring Indian citizenship:

1. Birth
2. Descent
3. Registration
4. Naturalisation
5. Incorporation of some territory into India

---

### (a) Citizenship by Birth

According to **Section 3**, a person born in India on or after the 26th January, 1950, but before the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 1986, and those born in India on or after such commencement and either of whose parents is a citizen of India at the time of his birth is a citizen of India by birth except when:

1. His father possesses diplomatic immunity and is not an Indian citizen; **OR**
2. His father is an enemy alien and his birth occurs at a place under enemy occupation

---

### (b) Citizenship by Descent

**S. 4** provides for citizenship by descent. A person born outside India on or after January 26, 1950, but before the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 1992, is a citizen of India by descent if at the time of his birth his father is an Indian citizen, or a person born outside India on or after such commencement shall be a citizen of India by descent if either of his parents is a citizen of India at the time of his birth.

**Proviso:** If either of the parents of such a person was a citizen of India by descent only, that person shall not be an Indian citizen by virtue of this provision unless:
- His birth is registered at an Indian consulate, **OR**
- Either of his parents is, at the time of his birth, in service under Government in India

---

### (c) Citizenship by Registration

**S. 5** deals with citizenship by registration. The following categories of persons, if not already citizens of India, can be registered as Indian citizens, after taking an oath of allegiance:

- (a) Persons of Indian origin ordinarily resident in India and residing there for six months immediately preceding the application for registration
- Persons of Indian origin who are ordinarily resident outside undivided India
- Women married to the Indian citizens
- Minor children of Indian citizens
- Persons of full age and capacity who are citizens of a Commonwealth country

**Note:** Category (a), mentioned above, covers migrants from Pakistan who could not become Indian citizens under the provisions of the Constitution.

**Since 2003**, citizenship can be granted to an overseas citizen of India right in accordance with the provisions of Sections 7A and 7B.

The registration granted to an overseas citizen under Section 7A can be withdrawn/cancelled in terms of Section 7D by the Central Government.

---

### (d) Citizenship by Naturalisation

**S. 6** deals with citizenship by naturalisation. A person of full age and capacity who is a citizen of a non-Commonwealth country may become a citizen by naturalisation, if the Central Government is satisfied that he fulfils the conditions laid down in the Act. These conditions are:

- He is not a subject or citizen of a country where Indian citizens are prevented from becoming citizens by naturalisation
- He renounces his citizenship of the other country
- He has resided and/or been in government service for 12 months immediately preceding the date of application
- During 7 years prior to these 12 months, he has resided and/or been in government service for not less than four years
- He is of good character
- He has an adequate knowledge of a language recognised by the Constitution
- After naturalisation he intends to reside in India, or enter into service with government international organisation, or a society or company in India

---

### (e) Citizenship by Incorporation of Territory

**S. 7** provides for citizenship by incorporation of territory. On any territory becoming a part of India, the Central Government may notify the persons who shall be citizens of India by reason of their connection with that territory.

---

### (f) Commonwealth Citizen

A citizen of a Commonwealth country has the status of a **Commonwealth citizen** in India.

---

## Dual Citizenship under the Citizenship Act

The Citizenship Act was twice amended to provide for dual citizenship:

- By the **amending Act of 2003** provision was made for acquisition of overseas citizenship of India by persons of Indian origin of 16 specified countries other than Pakistan and Bangladesh
- The 2003 amendment provides for the manner and methods by which a person could acquire a citizenship of India and its revocation
- In **2005**, the Act was further amended to:
  - (i) Expand the scope of grant of overseas citizenship of India to persons of Indian origin of all countries except Pakistan and Bangladesh
  - (ii) Reduce the period of residence in India from two years to one year for persons registered as overseas citizens of India to acquire Indian citizenship

**Note:** However, this concept is distinct from Indian Citizenship, not only with regard to the procedure for grant of citizenship and the privileges consequent upon registration but also with regard to the cancellation of the citizenship.

---

## Renunciation of Citizenship

**Section 8** provides that an Indian citizen of full age and capacity, who is also a citizen or national of another country, can renounce his Indian citizenship by making a declaration to that effect and having it registered.

**Important Points:**
- Registration of such a declaration is withheld when made during a war in which India may be engaged
- When a male person renounces his citizenship, every minor child of his also ceases to be an Indian citizen though such a child, within a year of his attaining full age, may resume Indian citizenship by making a declaration to that effect

---

## Cessation of Citizenship

**Section 9** provides for termination of Indian citizenship upon acquisition of citizenship of another country.

According to S. 9, a citizen of India ceases to be so on his voluntarily acquiring citizenship of another country by naturalization, registration or otherwise. This provision does not apply during a war in which India may be engaged.

Under Rule 30 of the Citizenship Rules, this authority is the Central Government which acts in a quasi-judicial capacity while discharging this function. Voluntarily obtaining the passport of a foreign country is, according to the Citizenship Rules, conclusive proof of an Indian citizen having voluntarily acquired citizenship of that country.

**There is no automatic loss of Indian citizenship by acquisition of a foreign passport.** Whether a person has lost his Indian citizenship or not is to be decided by the Central Government.

### Case Law: S. Nalini Srikaran v. Union of India, AIR 2007

The child of Sri Lankan parents who were found guilty of assassinating the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, was held to be an Indian citizen since she was born while her mother was in an Indian prison. She did not cease to be an Indian citizen and was entitled to enter and live in this country till the status of her citizenship was determined by the Central Government under section 9(2), although soon after her parents were awarded the death penalty, her grandmother took her to Sri Lanka on a Sri Lankan passport and she had resided there ever since.

---

## Deprivation of Citizenship

Under **S. 10**, citizens of India by naturalisation, marriage, registration, domicile and residence may be deprived of citizenship by an order of the Central Government, if it is satisfied that:

- The registration or naturalisation was obtained by means of fraud, false representation or concealment of any material fact, **OR**
- He has shown himself by act or speech, to be disloyal or disaffected towards the Indian Constitution; **OR**
- During a war in which India may be engaged he has unlawfully traded or communicated with the enemy; **OR**
- Within five years of his registration or naturalisation, he has been sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two years; **OR**
- He has been ordinarily resident out of India for seven years continuously

**Exception:** This provision does not apply if he is a student abroad, or is in the service of a government in India, or an international organisation of which India is a member, or has registered annually at an Indian consulate his intention to retain his Indian citizenship.

### Procedure for Deprivation

Before making an order depriving a person of his citizenship, the Central Government is to give to the person concerned, a written notice containing the ground on which the order is proposed to be made.

The person concerned may have his case referred to a **committee of inquiry** if the ground is not (e). The Central Government is bound to refer the case to a committee consisting of:
- A chairman (a person who has held a judicial office for at least ten years)
- Two other members appointed by the Government

The committee holds the inquiry and the Central Government is to be ordinarily guided by its report in making the order.

## Expulsion of a Foreigner

The Supreme Court has asserted that the **power of the Government to expel a foreigner is absolute and unlimited**.

**Key Principles:**
- The Government has an unrestricted power to expel a foreigner without assigning any reasons
- A foreigner has no right to claim Indian citizenship
- No foreigner can claim to stay in India as a matter of right
- The Government has an unrestricted right to expel a foreigner
- A foreigner can claim the protection to his life and liberty under Art. 21
- However, the right to reside and settle in India as conferred by Art. 19(1)(d) is available only to the citizens of India and not to non-citizens
