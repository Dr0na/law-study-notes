# Module 05 - Part 2: Article 21A (Right to Education - Evolution and Importance)

## Introduction

The right to education was initially **not included as a fundamental right** in the Constitution and was included as a directive principle under **Article 45** which required the State to endeavour to provide, within a period of 10 years from the commencement of the Constitution, for free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of 14 years.

The directive in Art. 45 was not confined merely to primary education; it extended to providing free education up to the age of 14 years, whatever the stage of education it came to. Therefore, education for children of this age group should have been free, ideally speaking, at the latest by **1960**.

## Judicial Recognition Before Constitutional Amendment

### Case: Unnikrishnan

The Supreme Court implied the **right to education from the right to life and personal liberty** guaranteed by Art. 21.

As the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles are complementary to each other, The Court had emphasized that **"a child (citizen) has a Fundamental Right to free education up to the age of 14 years."**

This obligation can be discharged by the state either through:
- Governmental schools, **OR**
- Private schools run by non-governmental bodies, aided and recognised by the state

**The Supreme Court has implied the "Right to Education" as a fundamental right from Art. 21.** The word 'life' has been held to include 'education' because education promotes good and dignified life.

### Case: T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka

The scheme framed by the Court in Unnikrishnan and thereafter followed by the Governments was held to be an unreasonable restriction under Article 19(6) of the Constitution in respect of private unaided educational institutions.

## Capitation Fee and Article 14

### Case: Mohini Jain v. State of Karnataka

The Court accepted that the Constitution does not expressly guarantee the right to education, as such, as a Fundamental Right. But reading cumulatively Art. 21 along with the Directive Principles contained in Arts. 38, 39(a), 41 and 45, the Court opined that:

> "It becomes clear that the framers of the Constitution made it obligatory for the State to provide education for its citizens."

The Bench thus declared charging of capitation fee by the State recognised educational institutions as **"wholly arbitrary and as such violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution."**

## The Right to Education as a Fundamental Right

### Constitution (Eighty-Sixth Amendment) Act, 2002

Subsequent to the decision in Unnikrishnan, the **Constitution (Eighty-Sixth Amendment) Act, 2002** introduced **Article 21A** which makes the **right to education a fundamental right**.

The Article requires the State to provide **free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years** in such manner as the State may, by law, determine.

### Fundamental Duty - Article 51A(k)

Compulsoriness is sought to be ensured in the amendment of **article 51A** in the Chapter on Fundamental Duties by adding **clause (k)** and making it incumbent on:

> A parent or guardian to provide opportunities for education to his child or, as the case may be, ward between the age of six and fourteen years.

## Constitution (Ninety-third Amendment) Act, 2005

To promote the educational advancement of the socially and educationally backward classes of citizens i.e. the OBCs or the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in matters of admission of students to unaided educational institutions other than the minority educational institutions Parliament introduced **Article 15(5)** by the Constitution (Ninety-third Amendment) Act, 2005.

### Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006

Parliament then passed the **Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006 (5 of 2007)** to provide greater access to higher education including professional education to:
- Scheduled Castes
- Scheduled Tribes
- Other Backward Classes

## Scope of Article 21A

**Article 21-A read with Article 19(1)(a)** has been construed as giving all children the **right to have primary education in a medium of instruction of their choice**.

Art. 21A has also been construed as the **fundamental right of each and every child to receive education free from fear of security and safety** so that children have a right to receive education in a sound and safe building.
