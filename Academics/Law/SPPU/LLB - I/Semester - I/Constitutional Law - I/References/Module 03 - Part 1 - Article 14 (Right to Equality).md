# Module 03 - Part 1: Article 14 (Right to Equality)

## Introduction

The Constitution of India guarantees the Right to Equality through **Articles 14 to 18**. "Equality is one of the magnificent corner-stones of Indian democracy." The doctrine of equality before law is a necessary corollary of Rule of Law which pervades the Indian Constitution.

**Article 14** outlaws discrimination in a general way and guarantees equality before law to all persons.

### Related Articles

Separate provisions to cover specific discriminatory situations have been made by subsequent Articles:
- **Art. 15** prohibits discrimination against citizens on such specific grounds as religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth
- **Art. 16** guarantees to the citizens of India equality of opportunity in matters of public employment
- **Art. 17** abolishes untouchability
- **Art. 18** abolishes titles, other than a military or academic distinction

Thus, the Supreme Court has said that the Constitution lays down provisions both for **protective discrimination** as also **affirmative action**.

**Articles 21 and 14 are the heart of the chapter on Fundamental Rights.** They cover myriad features of life.

## Right to Equality as a Basic Feature

### Case: Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, AIR 1973

It may be noted that the **right to equality has been declared by the Supreme Court as a basic feature of the Constitution**. The Constitution is wedded to the concept of equality. The Preamble to the Constitution emphasizes upon the principle of equality as basic to the Constitution.

This means that **even a constitutional amendment offending the right to equality will be declared invalid**. Neither Parliament nor any State Legislature can transgress the principle of equality.

---

## Text of Article 14

**Art. 14** runs as follows: "The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India."

Article 14 bars discrimination and prohibits discriminatory laws. Art. 14 is now proving as a bulwark against any arbitrary or discriminatory state action. The horizons of equality as embodied in Art. 14 have been expanding as a result of the judicial pronouncements.

---

## Two Concepts in Article 14

### 1. Equality Before Law

The first is a **negative concept** which ensures that:
- There is no special privilege in favour of any one
- All are equally subject to the ordinary law of the land
- No person, whatever be his rank or condition, is above the law

This is equivalent to the second corollary of the **DICEAN concept of the Rule of Law** in Britain.

#### Exceptions to Equality Before Law

This, however, is not an absolute rule and there are a number of exceptions to it:
- Foreign diplomats enjoy immunity from the country's judicial process
- **Art. 361** extends immunity to the President of India and the State Governors
- Public officers and judges also enjoy some protection
- Some special groups and interests, like the trade unions, have been accorded special privileges by law

### 2. Equal Protection of Laws

The second concept, **'equal protection of laws'**, is positive in content. It does not mean that identically the same law should apply to all persons, or that every law must have a universal application within the country irrespective of differences of circumstances.

**It denotes equality of treatment in equal circumstances.** It implies that among equals the law should be equal and equally administered, that the like should be treated alike without distinction of race, religion, wealth, social status or political influence.

---

## Judicial Interpretation

### Case: Sri Srinivasa Theatre v. Govt. of Tamil Nadu

The Supreme Court has explained that the two expressions 'equality before law' and 'equal protection of law' do not mean the same thing even if there may be much in common between them.

**"Equality before law"** is a dynamic concept having many facets:
1. **One facet** is that there shall be no privileged person or class and that none shall be above law
2. **Another facet** is "the obligation upon the State to bring about, through the machinery of law, a more equal society"

**Art. 14 thus means that 'equals should be treated alike'**; A Legislature is entitled to make reasonable classification for purposes of legislation and treat all in one class on an equal footing.

---

## Reasonable Classification

### Principle

**Article 14 forbids class legislation; it does not forbid reasonable classification** of persons, objects and transactions by the Legislature for the purpose of achieving specific ends.

### Two-Fold Test for Valid Classification

Classification to be reasonable should fulfil the following two tests:

#### Test 1: Intelligible Differentia
It should not be arbitrary, artificial or evasive. It should be based on an intelligible differentia, some real and substantial distinction, which distinguishes persons or things grouped together in the class from others left out of it.

#### Test 2: Rational Nexus
The differentia adopted as the basis of classification must have a rational or reasonable nexus with the object sought to be achieved by the statute in question.

**Whether a classification adopted by a law is reasonable or not is a matter for the courts to decide.**

---

## Burden of Proof

### General Rule

When a person seeks to impeach the validity of a law on the ground that it offends Art. 14, the **onus is on him** to plead and prove the infirmity.

If a person complains of unequal treatment, the burden lies on him to place before the court sufficient material from which it can be inferred that there is unequal treatment.

### Case: G.K. Krishnan v. State of Tamil Nadu, AIR 1975

The initial presumption is in favour of the validity of the law, and if the person fails to adduce sufficient evidence in support of his challenge to the law in question, his plea of the provision in question being violative of Art. 14 cannot be entertained.

### Case: A.V. Nachane v. Union of India, AIR 1982

When the employees of the Life Insurance Corporation were exempted from the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA) by a law of Parliament, and these employees challenged the law as discriminatory, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of establishing hostile discrimination was on the petitioners (L.I.C. employees).

### Exception: Dalmia v. Tendolkar, AIR 1958

On the other hand, **if discrimination is writ large on the face of the legislation, the onus may shift to the state** to sustain the validity of the legislation in question.

---

## Judicial Review and Policy Matters

The Supreme Court has reiterated that the Courts cannot act as an Appellate Authority and examine the correctness, suitability and appropriateness of a policy nor are courts advisors to the executive on matters of policy which the executive is entitled to formulate.

**Judicial review** in this area is confined to the examination as to whether:
- Any Fundamental Rights have been violated, **OR**
- It is opposed to the provisions of the Constitution

## Valid Classifications - Case Law

### 1. Geographical Classification

#### Case: State of Bombay v. Balsara, AIR 1951

The differentiation made by the prohibition law between Indians and foreigners staying in India for a short time is valid.

#### Case: Joshi v. Madhya Bharat, AIR 1955

For admission to a medical college of a State non-residents were required to pay capitation fee but residents in the State were exempt from the same. This classification, based on residence within the State, is valid.

#### Case: Kishan Singh v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1955 (Geographical Differentiation)

The State of Rajasthan passed an Act prescribing a procedure for fixing fair and equitable rent payable by the tenants in the Marwar region. It was challenged on the ground that it did not apply to the whole State.

**Rejecting the objection**, the Supreme Court stated that Art. 14 prohibits unequal treatment of persons similarly situated. The Act would be bad if it were established that conditions prevailing in other areas of the State were similar to those in Marwar where the Act applied. This was not proved. An Act could not be held discriminatory merely because it did not apply to the whole State.

### 2. Procedural Differentiation

#### Case: State of Uttar Pradesh v. Deoman Upadhyaya, AIR 1960

According to S. 27 of the Evidence Act, a statement made to a police officer by an accused in custody when it leads to the discovery of a fact is admissible in evidence. It was argued against the provision that it drew a distinction between statements made by persons in custody and those not in custody.

The provision was however upheld because the classification between persons in custody and those not in custody in the context of admissibility of statements made by them concerning the offence charged was not arbitrary or artificial.

### 3. Single Entity Classification

#### Case: Charanjit Lal v. Union of India, AIR 1951 (Legislation Applicable to a Single Person)

A large cotton textiles mill employing a large labour force, closed down due to mismanagement. Parliament enacted an Act empowering the Central Government to appoint its own directors to take over the control and management of the company and its properties. A shareholder challenged the Act on the ground that since it singled out the company, it was discriminatory and bad under Art. 14.

**The Supreme Court by a majority declared the Act to be valid.**

### 4. Unique Entity Classification

- A special law passed for **Shri Jagannath Temple** was held valid for the temple held a unique position amongst the Hindu temples and so it could be given a special treatment
- Special provisions can be made for each university as **each university is a class by itself**. Art. 14 does not require that provisions of every University Act must always be the same
- The **Prime Minister** is allowed the use of an Indian Air Force aircraft for non-official purposes (including election) but not so the leaders of other political parties. This is not discriminatory because in view of the P.M.'s status and duties, he is a class by himself

### 5. Disaster-Specific Legislation

#### Case: Charan Lal Sahu v. Union of India

Consequent upon the **Bhopal Gas Disaster**, Parliament enacted the Bhopal Gas Disaster (Processing of Claims) Act, 1985. Under this Act, the Central Government took over the exclusive right of representing and acting on behalf of every victim for claiming compensation from the concerned multinational corporation.

The validity of the Act was challenged on two main grounds:
1. Could Parliament enact such a law?
2. Was the law not discriminatory under Art. 14?

**The Supreme Court upheld the law on both these grounds.**

---

## Invalid Classification - Special Courts

### Case: State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar

Was involved a Bengal law permitting setting up of special courts for the 'speedier trial' of such 'offences', or 'classes of offences' or 'cases', or 'classes of cases', as the State Government might direct by a general or special order.

These courts were to follow a procedure less advantageous to the accused in defending himself than the procedure followed by the ordinary criminal courts.

**The Act was held invalid as it made no reasonable classification.**

---

## Administrative Discretion & Article 14

A common tendency in modern democracies is to confer discretionary power on the government or administrative officers. In order to ensure that discretion is properly exercised, it is necessary that the statute in question lays down some norms or principles according to which the administrator has to exercise the discretion.

Many a time the statutes do not do this and leave the administrator free to exercise his power according to his judgment. This creates the danger of **official arbitrariness** which is subversive of the doctrine of equality. To mitigate this danger, the courts have invoked Art. 14.

### Landmark Ruling: Maneka Gandhi Case

"… when a statute vests unguided and unrestricted power in an authority to affect the rights of a person without laying down any policy or principle which is to guide the authority in exercise of this power, it would be affected by the vice of discrimination since it would leave it open to the Authority to discriminate between persons and things similarly situated."

### Case: Air India v. Nergesh Meerza, AIR 1981

A regulation made by Air India International, a statutory corporation, fixed the normal age of retirement of air hostesses at 35 years but authorised the managing director to extend the same to 45 years at his option subject to other conditions being satisfied.

**The regulation was held bad** as it armed the managing director with uncanalized and unguided discretion to extend the age of retirement of any air hostess. No guidelines, principles or norms were laid down subject to which the power was to be exercised. Nor was there any procedural safeguard available to an air hostess who was denied extension.

### Case: Re Kerala Education Bill, AIR 1958

The Kerala Education Bill gave a broad power of control to the government over private schools. As for example, government could recognise or not a newly established school, or could take over any school.

The Supreme Court held that the general policy of the Bill was deducible from its preamble and the title, and the same was further reinforced by more definite statements of policy in different clauses.

## Administrative Discrimination

The first proposition discussed above envisages that where a statute is discriminatory either because it does not make a reasonable classification, or confers unregulated discretion on the executive, the statute itself is void under Art. 14.

The second proposition, however, envisages the situation where **the statute itself does not suffer from any such vice, but the administrative authority may implement it in a discriminatory manner**, or may not follow the policy or principle laid down in the Act to regulate its discretion.

### Case: Vellore Educational Trust v. State of Andhra Pradesh

A Tamil Trust made an application to the Government of Andhra Pradesh seeking permission to establish an engineering college for the benefit of the Tamil minority in the State of Andhra Pradesh.

The Government **refused permission** to the Trust but at the same time it **granted permission** to two other societies to establish private engineering colleges.

The Court quashed the Government's refusal of permission to the Tamil Trust as "not at all tenable" and quashed it. The Court also directed the Government to reconsider the matter and dispose it of according to law. **This is an instance of discriminatory governmental action.**

### Case: Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib, AIR 1981

Here a large number of candidates were given admission to the regional engineering college because of high marks obtained at the interview although they had secured low marks at the written qualifying examination.

According to the Supreme Court, this did give rise to the suspicion that marks at the interview had been manipulated to favour candidates but did not prove mala fides. The Court did not quash the admissions made by the college because it agreed to take in 50 best students next year in addition to the normal in-take.

The Court laid down **guidelines** so that the interview system is conducted fairly.

---

## Arbitrary State Action

**Art. 14 out-laws arbitrary administrative action.** When there is arbitrariness in state action, Art. 14 springs into action and the courts strike down such action. Arbitrary state action infringes Art. 14.

### Case: E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu, AIR 1974

**Any action that is arbitrary must necessarily involve the negation of equality.** Abuse of power is hit by Art. 14.

### Case: Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR 1982

Rule of law which permeates the entire fabric of the Indian Constitution excludes arbitrariness. **"Wherever we find arbitrariness or unreasonableness there is denial of rule of law."** Art. 14 enacts primarily a guarantee against arbitrariness.

### Maneka Gandhi Case

Is an authority for the proposition that the **principles of natural justice are an integral part of the guarantee of equality** assured by Art. 14. An order depriving a person of his civil right passed without affording him an opportunity of being heard suffers from the vice of violation of natural justice and is thus an arbitrary order.

### Case: Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority of India, AIR 1979 SC

The International Airport Authority, a statutory body, floated a tender for running a restaurant at the Bombay Airport. Certain conditions of eligibility were laid down for the contractor. The authority awarded the contract to one who did not fulfil the norms of eligibility laid down.

The Supreme Court ruled that the authority ought to have stuck to the conditions prescribed by it. The action of the authority was discriminatory as it did not give an equal chance to other persons similarly situated to tender for the contract. That would be **"plainly arbitrary and without reason"**.

---

## Cut-Off Dates and Article 14

### Case: D.S. Nakara v. Union of India, AIR 1983

The Government issued an office memorandum announcing a liberalised pension scheme for retired government servants but made it applicable to those who had retired **after March 31, 1979**.

The Supreme Court held the fixing of the cut-off date to be **discriminatory as violating Art. 14**.

---

## Compassionate Appointment

### Case: V. Sivamurthy v. State of A.P., (2008)

**Appointment on compassionate ground is never considered a right of a person.** In fact, such appointment is violative of rule of equality enshrined and guaranteed under Article 14.

At the same time, however, in certain circumstances, appointment on compassionate ground of dependants of the deceased employee is considered inevitable so that the family of the deceased employee may not starve.

The primary object of such scheme is to save the bereaved family from sudden financial crisis occurring due to death of the sole bread earner. **It is thus an exception to the general rule of equality.**

## Special Classifications - Other Case Law

### Case: Sarbananda Sonowal v. Union of India, (2005)

The power of the Government of India to expel foreigners is absolute and unlimited and there is no provision in the Constitution fettering its discretion and the executive government has unrestricted right to expel a foreigner.

The procedure under the Foreigners Act and the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order 1964 is just, fair and reasonable and does not offend any Constitutional provision.

### Case: Mohan Kumar Singhania v. Union of India

The Supreme Court has ruled that each of the various civil services, namely, I.A.S., I.F.S., I.P.S., Group A Services and Group B Services, is a 'separate and determinate' service forming a distinct cadre and that each of the Services is founded on intelligible differentia.

### Case: Hindusthan Paper Corporation Ltd. v. Govt. of Kerala, AIR 1986

Favourable treatment shown to a public sector undertaking is not discriminatory. These undertakings stand in a different class altogether and the classification made between these enterprises and others is a valid one.
