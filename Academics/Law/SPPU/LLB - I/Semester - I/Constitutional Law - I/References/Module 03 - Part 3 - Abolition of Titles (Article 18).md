# Module 03 - Part 3: Abolition of Titles (Article 18)

## Article 18 - Constitutional Provisions

### Article 18(1)
Prohibits the state from conferring any **'title'** except a military or academic distinction.

### Article 18(2)
Prohibits citizens of India from accepting any title from a foreign government.

### Article 18(3)
A foreigner holding any office of profit or trust under the state cannot accept any title from any foreign state without the consent of the President.

### Article 18(4)
No person holding any office of profit under the state is to accept, without the consent of the President, any present, emolument, or office of any kind from or under any foreign state.

## Legal Implications

It is not clear as to what would happen if a citizen accepts a title in contravention of Art. 18(2). It is open to Parliament, under its residuary powers, to make a law prescribing what should be done with regard to an individual who accepts a title contrary to the Article.

## National Awards - Supreme Court Ruling

### Case: Balaji Raghavan v. Union of India AIR 1996 SC

The Supreme Court has ruled that the national awards like:
- **"Bharat Ratna"**
- **"Padma Vibhushan"**
- Other similar awards awarded by the Government of India

are **NOT 'titles'** within the meaning of Art. 18(1).

These awards are not violative of the principles of equality as guaranteed by Arts. 14 and 18.

## Theory Behind Article 18

### The Principle

The theory of equality does not mandate that merit should not be recognized.

### Constitutional Framework

**Art. 51A** of the Constitution speaks of the fundamental duties.

**Clause (j)** of Art. 51A exhorts every citizen:
> "to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity, so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement".

It is, therefore, necessary that there should be a system of awards and decorations to recognize excellence in the performance of these duties.

## Guidelines for National Awards

### Usage of Awards

Awards conferred by the state are **not to be used as suffixes or prefixes**.

### Selection Committee

The Court has also suggested that the Prime Minister in consultation with the President should appoint a **high-level committee** to lay down criteria for selection of persons for these awards.
