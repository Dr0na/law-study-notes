# Module 02 - Part 3: General Principles Relating to Fundamental Rights (Articles 12 and 13)

## Concept of Fundamental Rights – Their Origin and Development

Since the 17th century, if not earlier, human thinking has been veering round to the theory that man has certain essential, basic, natural and inalienable rights or freedoms and it is the function of the state, in order that human liberty may be preserved, human personality developed, and an effective social and democratic life promoted, to recognise these rights and freedoms and allow them a free play.

### Philosophical Foundations

According to **LOCKE**, man is born "with a title to perfect freedom and an uncontrolled enjoyment of all the rights and privileges of the Law of Nature" and he has by nature a power "to preserve his property--that is, his life, liberty, and estate, against the injuries and attempts of other men."

The **Declaration of the French Revolution, 1789**, which may be regarded as a concrete political statement on Human Rights and which was inspired by the LOCKEIAN philosophy declared: "The aim of all political association is the conservation of the natural and inalienable rights of man".

**The concept of human rights represents an attempt to protect the individual from oppression and injustice.**

## Dual Aspect of Fundamental Rights

The entrenched Fundamental Rights have a dual aspect:

1. **From one point of view**, they confer justiciable rights on the people which can be enforced through the courts against the government
2. **From another point of view**, the Fundamental Rights constitute restrictions and limitations on government action, whether it is taken by the Centre, or a State or a local government

The government cannot take any action, administrative or legislative, by which a Fundamental Right is infringed.

### Entrenchment

**Entrenchment** means that the guaranteed rights cannot be taken away by an ordinary law. A law curtailing or infringing an entrenched right would be declared to be unconstitutional.

The purpose of enumerating Fundamental Rights in the Constitution "is to safeguard the basic human rights from the vicissitudes of political controversy and to place them beyond the reach of the political parties who, by virtue of their majority, may come to form the government at the centre or in the State".

## Historical Development

### United States of America

The modern trend of guaranteeing Fundamental Rights to the people may be traced to the **Constitution of the U.S.A. drafted in 1787**. The U.S. Constitution was the first modern Constitution to give concrete shape to the concept of human Rights by putting them in to the Constitution and making them justiciable and enforceable through the instrumentality of the courts.

### International Developments

The concept of the people's basic rights has been given a more concrete and universal texture by:
- The **Charter of Human Rights** enacted by the United Nations Organization (U.N.O.)
- The **European Convention on Human Rights**

The Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights inter alia declares: "Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world".

### United Kingdom

There is no formal declaration of people's Fundamental Rights in Britain. There prevails in Britain the concept of **Rule of Law** which represents, in short, the thesis that the executive is answerable to the courts for any action which is contrary to the law of the land.

Rule of law constitutes no legal restraint on the legislative power of Parliament and, thus, cannot be equated to the concept of Fundamental Rights.

Ultimately, the British Parliament enacted the **Human Rights Act, 1998**. The purpose of the Act is to give effect to the rights and freedoms guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights.

### Australia

The Australian Constitution, following the traditions of Britain, does not have a Bill of Rights but guarantees only a few rights, e.g., freedom of religion.

### Canada

The Canadian Constitution had only a few guaranteed Rights. Then, the Canadian Parliament enacted a law laying down basic Rights of the people. Being only a law made by Parliament, it did not constitute any restriction on Parliament itself.

## Fundamental Rights in India

### Background and Necessity

During the British rule in India, human rights were violated by the rulers on a very wide scale. Therefore, the framers of the Constitution, many of whom had suffered long incarceration during the British regime, had a very positive attitude towards these rights.

**Reasons for Fundamental Rights in India:**
1. The Indian society is fragmented into many religious, cultural and linguistic groups, and it was necessary to declare Fundamental Rights to give to the people a sense of security and confidence
2. Though democracy was being introduced in India, yet democratic traditions were lacking
3. There was a danger that the majority in the legislature may enact laws which may be oppressive to individuals or minority groups
4. Such a danger could be minimised by having a Bill of Rights in the Constitution

### Nature of Fundamental Rights

**Part III** of the Constitution protects substantive as well as procedural rights.

The Fundamental Rights in India, apart from guaranteeing certain basic civil Rights and freedoms to all, also fulfil the important function of:
- Giving a few safeguards to minorities
- Outlawing discrimination
- Protecting religious freedom and cultural rights

During emergency, however, some curtailment of the Fundamental Rights does take place. But all these curtailments of Fundamental Rights are of a temporary nature.

**Important Note:** Fundamental Rights must not be read in isolation but along with directive principles and fundamental duties.

## Classification of Fundamental Rights

**Articles 12 to 35** of the Constitution pertain to Fundamental Rights of the people.

The Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution have been grouped under **seven heads** as follows:

### 1. Right to Equality (Articles 14 to 18)
- Article 14 is the most important

### 2. Right to Freedom (Articles 19 to 22)
- Guarantee several freedoms
- Most important: freedom of speech

### 3. Right against Exploitation (Articles 23 and 24)

### 4. Right to Freedom of Religion (Articles 25 to 28)

### 5. Cultural and Educational Rights (Articles 29 and 30)

### 6. Right to Property
- Now very much diluted
- Secured to some extent by Arts. 30-A, 31-A, 31-B and 31-C

### 7. Right to Constitutional Remedies (Articles 32 to 35)

## Implied Rights

The Supreme Court has been able to imply by its interpretative process, several Fundamental Rights, such as:
- Freedom of press
- Right to privacy

These have been derived out of the expressly stated Fundamental Rights.

---

## Role of the Supreme Court

The Supreme Court plays a very significant role in relation to the Fundamental Rights:

1. **The Court acts as the protector and the guardian of these rights**
2. **The Court acts as the interpreter of the Fundamental Rights**
