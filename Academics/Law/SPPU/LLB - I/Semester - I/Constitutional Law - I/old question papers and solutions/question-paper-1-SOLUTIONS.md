# 📘 PART A: LONG QUESTIONS (15 MARKS EACH)

## Q.1) Explain the meaning of Citizenship. Discuss the various kinds of Citizenship provided under the Citizenship Act 1955.

### INTRODUCTION (2 marks)

Citizenship is the legal bond between an individual and a state, conferring rights and imposing duties. Under the Indian Constitution, Articles 5 to 11 define citizenship at commencement, while the **Citizenship Act, 1955**, enacted under Article 11, provides comprehensive provisions for acquisition and loss of citizenship.

India follows the principle of **single citizenship**—there is only Indian citizenship with no separate state citizenship. This contrasts with federal countries like the USA which have dual citizenship (federal and state). Single citizenship promotes national unity and ensures uniform rights for all citizens throughout India.

### MEANING OF CITIZENSHIP (2 marks)

**Definition:** A citizen is a person who owes permanent allegiance to a state and is entitled to its protection and full civil and political rights.

**Key Features of Indian Citizenship:**
- **Single citizenship** only (Article 5-11)
- **No dual citizenship** permitted (Article 9)
- Parliament has exclusive power to legislate (Article 11)
- Uniform rights throughout India

### CITIZENSHIP ACT, 1955 - FIVE METHODS (10 marks)

The Act provides five ways of acquiring citizenship, remembered by mnemonic **BDRNI**:

#### 1. CITIZENSHIP BY BIRTH (Section 3) - 2 marks

**Principle:** Person born in India is citizen by birth.

**Provisions:**
- Born in India on/after Jan 26, 1950 = Citizen
- **Exceptions:** (a) Father has diplomatic immunity and not Indian citizen, OR (b) Father is enemy alien, birth during enemy occupation

**Amendment Impact:**
- Pre-1986: Jus soli (birthright) - anyone born in India was citizen
- Post-1986: At least one parent must be Indian citizen
- Prevents automatic citizenship to illegal immigrants' children

#### 2. CITIZENSHIP BY DESCENT (Section 4) - 2 marks

**Principle:** Person born outside India can be citizen if parent was Indian at time of birth.

**Provisions:**
- Pre-1992: Father must be Indian citizen
- Post-1992: Either parent can confer citizenship (gender-neutral)

**Proviso:** If parent was citizen by descent only, requires:
- Birth registration at Indian consulate, OR
- Parent in Government of India service

#### 3. CITIZENSHIP BY REGISTRATION (Section 5) - 2 marks

**Eligible Categories:**
- Persons of Indian origin resident in India (6 months)
- Persons of Indian origin resident outside undivided India
- Women married to Indian citizens
- Minor children of Indian citizens
- Commonwealth country citizens

**Overseas Citizenship (2003):**
- Sections 7A, 7B provide OCI
- For persons of Indian origin (except Pakistan, Bangladesh)
- Limited rights, can be cancelled (Section 7D)

#### 4. CITIZENSHIP BY NATURALISATION (Section 6) - 2 marks

**For:** Non-Commonwealth foreign nationals

**Conditions:**
- Not from country preventing Indian naturalization
- Renounce other citizenship
- Resident 12 months immediately preceding
- Resident 4 years out of preceding 7 years
- Good character
- Knowledge of Indian language
- Intent to reside/serve in India

#### 5. CITIZENSHIP BY INCORPORATION (Section 7) - 2 marks

**Principle:** When territory becomes part of India, Central Government notifies who becomes citizen based on connection with territory.

**Applied:** Goa, Pondicherry integration

### CONCLUSION (1 mark)

The Citizenship Act provides a comprehensive framework supplementing constitutional provisions. The five methods (BDRNI) balance birth connection, heritage, voluntary adoption, merit-based acquisition, and territorial integration. Single citizenship promotes national unity, prevents discrimination based on state of residence, and strengthens federal structure while maintaining unity in diversity.

## Q.2) Explain the Meaning, object, purpose and scope of the preamble. Discuss whether preamble is part of the constitution or not.

### INTRODUCTION (1 mark)

The Preamble to the Constitution embodies fundamental values, philosophy, and objectives of the constitutional framework. It serves as the "key to open the mind of the makers," reflecting aspirations of the people of India and providing interpretative guidance for constitutional provisions.

### TEXT (1 mark)

"WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens JUSTICE, LIBERTY, EQUALITY, FRATERNITY..."

### MEANING OF KEY WORDS (5 marks)

#### SOVEREIGN
India is free from external control, supreme within territory, not subordinate to any foreign power. Complete independence achieved.

#### SOCIALIST (Added 1976)
Democratic socialism—mixed economy, welfare state, reduce inequalities. Not communist socialism; private property allowed with social obligations.

#### SECULAR (Added 1976)
No state religion, equal respect to all religions, freedom of religion (Arts. 25-28). **S.R. Bommai v. UOI, AIR 1994:** Secularism is **basic feature**.

Indian secularism differs from Western (complete separation)—follows principled distance with positive engagement for reform.

#### DEMOCRATIC
Government by the people, representative democracy, universal adult franchise (Art. 326), periodic elections, rule of law.

#### REPUBLIC
Elected head of state (President), not hereditary monarch. Fixed 5-year term. Contrast: UK has hereditary Queen.

- **Political:** Equal political rights, universal franchise, participation in governance

#### LIBERTY - Thought, Expression, Belief, Faith, Worship
Essential for human development and democracy. Guaranteed through Part III (Arts. 19, 21, 25-28).

#### EQUALITY - Status and Opportunity
- **Status:** No discrimination, abolition of untouchability (Art. 17), abolition of titles (Art. 18)
- **Opportunity:** Equal opportunity in employment (Art. 16), education, no discrimination (Arts. 15, 16)

#### FRATERNITY - Dignity, Unity & Integrity
Spirit of brotherhood. **Dignity of individual** (Arts. 21, 23, 24). **Unity and integrity** (added 1976 after territorial threats).

### IS PREAMBLE PART OF CONSTITUTION? (3 marks)

**Berubari Union Case, AIR 1960:**
- Held: Preamble **NOT part** of Constitution
- Reasoning: Not enacted under Art. 394, merely introductory

**Kesavananda Bharati v. Kerala, AIR 1973:**
- **Overruled Berubari**
- Held: Preamble **IS part** of Constitution
- Reasoning: Integral part, adopted together Nov 26, 1949

**Current Position:**
- Preamble is part but NOT enforceable
- Not source of substantive powers
- Serves as aid to interpretation

### SCOPE & PURPOSE (1 mark)

1. **Key to makers' mind** - Shows framers' intentions
2. **Aid to interpretation** - When Constitution ambiguous

Fundamental Rights evolved from 17th century philosophy to concrete constitutional guarantees, influenced by international movements and national freedom struggle. From Gopalan's narrow view to Maneka's expansive interpretation, from excluding privacy to recognizing it (Puttaswamy), evolution continues. These rights remain bulwark of Indian democracy, protecting liberty while adapting to contemporary challenges—dynamic provisions responding to felt necessities of times.

---

## Q.5) Discuss the various freedoms under the Indian Constitution. Discuss relevant reasonable restriction on those freedoms.

### INTRODUCTION (1 mark)

Article 19 guarantees six fundamental freedoms to all **citizens** of India, essential for democracy and human development. Originally seven freedoms; property (19(1)(f)) deleted by 44th Amendment, 1978. These freedoms are not absolute but subject to reasonable restrictions for specified grounds.

### THE SIX FREEDOMS (6 marks - 1 mark each)

**Mnemonic: SAMMPR**

#### 1. Speech and Expression (19(1)(a))

**Most important freedom**

Peaceable, unarmed assemblies—meetings, demonstrations, processions.

**Restrictions (19(3) - 2 grounds):** Sovereignty, Public order

#### 3. Association (19(1)(c))

Six freedoms are essential for democracy and individual development. Reasonable restrictions balance individual liberty with social welfare and national security. Constitution wisely recognizes absolute freedom impossible in organized society while ensuring restrictions don't become oppressive tools.

**Article 22:** Specific arrest safeguards—information, lawyer, production before magistrate

**Together:** Arts. 20, 21, 22 provide comprehensive criminal justice protection

**Maneka Gandhi:** All read together; procedure reasonable, fair, just

### CONCLUSION (1 mark)

With Arts. 21 and 22, create constitutional shield protecting personal liberty and dignity in criminal justice system.

---

## Q.7) Write the critical view on relevancy of caste for reservation to the Backward Classes.

### INTRODUCTION (1 mark)

Caste-based reservations remain most debated constitutional issue. Art. 16(4) empowers State to reserve for "backward class" inadequately represented. Critical question: Should caste be criterion, or economic/other factors? Debate peaked in **Indra Sawhney v. UOI, 1993** (Mandal Commission case).

### CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK (1 mark)

**Art. 15(4):** Special provisions for "socially and educationally backward classes"
**Art. 16(4):** Reservation for "backward class" inadequately represented

**Judicial interpretation:** "Backward class" = socially AND educationally backward—not merely economic or solely caste.

### JUDICIAL EVOLUTION (3 marks)

**K.C. Vasanth Kumar, 1985:** Five judges, five opinions:
- Chandrachud: Economic backwardness
- Desai: Only economic
- Chinnappa Reddy: Poverty, **caste**, occupation, habitation
- Sen: Poverty predominant; caste for identification
- Venkataramiah: **Caste factor relevant**

**Result:** No unanimous view—discretion to government.

**Indra Sawhney, 1993 (Mandal):**

**Background:** Mandal Commission (1979) identified OBCs (52% population), recommended 27% reservation based substantially on caste.

**Court held:** **Caste ONE factor, NOT SOLE factor** to assess backwardness.

**Reasoning:** Caste may indicate social backwardness (historical discrimination), but insufficient alone. Must combine with educational/social indicators.

**Creamy Layer (Most Important):**
- Socially/economically advanced members within backward caste **must be excluded**
- Even if belong to backward caste
- Purpose: Benefit truly disadvantaged, not privileged

### ARGUMENTS FOR CASTE-BASED (2 marks)

1. **Historical:** Centuries of caste-based discrimination, lower castes denied opportunities
2. **Social Reality:** Caste still determines status, occupational segregation
3. **Identifiability:** Easily identifiable, administrative convenience
4. **Constitutional Recognition:** SC/ST identified by caste, Arts. 15(4), 16(4) recognize indirectly
5. **Substantive Equality:** Formal equality insufficient, affirmative action needed

### ARGUMENTS AGAINST SOLE RELIANCE (2 marks)

1. **Over-Inclusive:** Includes affluent backward caste members, benefits monopolized
2. **Under-Inclusive:** Excludes poor from forward castes, ignores economic backwardness
3. **Perpetuates Caste:** Reinforces caste identity, contradicts casteless society goal (Art. 16(2) prohibits caste discrimination, Art. 17 abolishes untouchability)
4. **Merit/Efficiency:** May compromise merit, affects administration efficiency
5. **Social Tension:** Creates divisions, forward-backward conflicts

### BALANCED APPROACH (1 mark)

**Optimal Position:**
1. **Caste as indicator, not sole:** Combine with economic status, education, occupation, social indicators
2. **Creamy layer mandatory:** Per Indra Sawhney, exclude advanced, periodic review
3. **Economic criteria:** 103rd Amendment, 2019: 10% for EWS beyond caste
4. **Sunset clause:** After 70+ years, reassess; graduation of beneficiaries
5. **Comprehensive policy:** Quality education, employment generation, skill development, address root causes

### CONCLUSION (1 mark)

Caste relevancy is nuanced. Cannot ignore given India's reality, but shouldn't be sole criterion. Indra Sawhney's creamy layer provides balance—recognizing caste as indicator while ensuring benefits reach truly disadvantaged. EWS reservations show move toward economic criteria. Ultimate goal: society where reservations unnecessary due to achieved equality. Till then, balanced approach considering caste with socio-economic indicators and mandatory creamy layer exclusion is most reasonable constitutional path.

**5. Indirect Enforcement:** Through legislation, judicial interpretation, education

### ELEVEN DUTIES (4 marks)

3. **Build Character:** Scientific temper, harmony, excellence

## Q.9) State and explain equality before law and equal protection of law with relevant case laws.

### INTRODUCTION (1 mark)

Article 14: "State shall not deny to any person equality before law or equal protection of laws within territory of India."

Cornerstone of equality, declared **basic feature** (**Kesavananda, 1973**). Necessary corollary of Rule of Law. Embodies two concepts—equality before law (negative) and equal protection (positive)—ensuring substantive equality.

### EQUALITY BEFORE LAW (3 marks)

**Concept:** Negative concept from British Rule of Law (Dicey).

**Meaning:** No special privilege, all equally subject to ordinary law, no one above law.

**Implications:** Same law for all, same courts, no privileged class.

**Exceptions (Reasonable):**
- President, Governors (Art. 361)—office protection
- Foreign diplomats—international law
- Judges—independence

**Sri Srinivasa Theatre:** "Equality before law" dynamic—no privileged class (one facet); State obligation to bring equal society (another facet).

### EQUAL PROTECTION (3 marks)

**Concept:** Positive concept from American Constitution (XIV Amendment).

**Meaning:** NOT identical law for all or universal application. MEANS: Equality in equal circumstances. Like treated alike without discrimination.

**Reasonable Classification Permitted:**

**Art. 14 forbids CLASS LEGISLATION but permits REASONABLE CLASSIFICATION**

**Two-Fold Test (I-R):**

**Test 1—Intelligible Differentia:** Real, substantial distinction; not arbitrary/artificial

**Test 2—Rational Nexus:** Differentia must have rational nexus with object sought

**Courts decide reasonableness.**

### CASE LAWS (3 marks)

**Bachan Singh, 1982:** "Rule of law excludes arbitrariness. Where arbitrariness/unreasonableness, denial of rule of law." **Art. 14 primarily guarantee against arbitrariness.**

**Valid Classifications:**

**Balsara, 1951:** Prohibition law differentiating Indians and short-stay foreigners—valid (reasonable basis).

**Kishan Singh, 1955:** Rajasthan Act for Marwar region only—valid. Art. 14 prohibits unequal treatment of **similarly situated**. Act bad only if similar conditions elsewhere (not proved). Not discriminatory merely because doesn't apply to whole State.

**Charanjit Lal, 1951:** Act for single company's takeover—valid. Single entity can constitute class if reasonable basis.

**Invalid Classification:**

**Anwar Ali Sarkar:** Bengal law for special courts, Government directs which offences, procedure less advantageous to accused—**invalid**. No reasonable classification, arbitrary power.

**Arbitrariness:**

**E.P. Royappa, 1974:** Chief Secretary transferred allegedly arbitrarily. **"Arbitrary action necessarily involves negation of equality."** Expanded Art. 14 from classification to anti-arbitrariness. Abuse of power hit by Art. 14.

**Maneka Gandhi, 1978:** Arts. 14, 19, 21 **not mutually exclusive**, read together. **Principles of natural justice integral** to Art. 14. Order without hearing=arbitrary=violates Art. 14.

**Ramana Shetty, 1979:** Airport Authority awarded contract to unqualified person. Should have stuck to prescribed conditions. Discriminatory, didn't give equal chance. **"Plainly arbitrary without reason."**

**Administrative Discretion:**

**Air India v. Nergesh, 1981:** Retirement age 35 for air hostesses, MD could extend to 45 at discretion—**invalid**. Uncanalized, unguided discretion, no guidelines. Violates Art. 14.

### CONCLUSION (1 mark)

Art. 14's two concepts provide comprehensive protection against discrimination. Equality before law ensures none above law; equal protection ensures affirmative action for equals. Reasonable classification allows different treatment if intelligible differentia exists with rational nexus. Modern interpretation expanded Art. 14 to strike arbitrariness, making it powerful tool against executive excess. As observed, Art. 14 is truly "heart" of FRs chapter, protecting against discriminatory laws and arbitrary state action.

## Q.10(b) Doctrine of Eclipse with recent judicial pronouncement

### INTRODUCTION (1 mark)

Doctrine of Eclipse applies to **pre-Constitution laws** inconsistent with Fundamental Rights. Under Art. 13(1), laws in force before Jan 26, 1950 inconsistent with FRs are void **to extent of inconsistency**.

### PRINCIPLE (2 marks)

**Doctrine:** Pre-Constitution law inconsistent with FR not **dead** but **eclipsed** (overshadowed). Remains dormant, can become operative if:
- Constitution amended to remove inconsistency, OR
- FR itself amended/deleted

**Rationale:** Pre-Constitution laws enacted without knowledge of FRs, shouldn't be completely struck down—remain dormant with revival possibility.

**Bhikaji v. M.P.:** Pre-Constitution law restricted trade, violated Art. 19(1)(g). Eclipsed when Constitution commenced. Not dead, only eclipsed. Inoperative against citizens but operative against non-citizens (19(1)(g) only for citizens). Can revive if 19(1)(g) amended.

### DISTINCTION (1 mark)

| Aspect | Pre-Constitution (13(1)) | Post-Constitution (13(2)) |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Status | Eclipsed (dormant) | Void ab initio (dead) |
| Revival | Can revive if FR amended | Cannot revive |
| Rationale | No FR knowledge | Made with FR knowledge |

### SIGNIFICANCE (1 mark)

Saves pre-existing laws from nullification, allows flexibility for future amendments, recognizes different treatment for before/after laws, practical constitutional transition approach. Still relevant when examining old laws. Occasionally invoked for pre-1950 law challenges (though most repealed/replaced).
