## Q. Right to Constitutional Remedies (Articles 32-35) / Discuss Five Writs with examples.

---

## I. INTRODUCTION

**Article 32** guarantees the **Right to Constitutional Remedies** and is described by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar as the **"heart and soul"** of the Constitution. Without a remedy, rights have no value. Article 32 makes the Fundamental Rights justiciable and enforceable through the Supreme Court.

**Article 32(1) provides:**
> "The right to move the Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part is guaranteed."

This right is itself a Fundamental Right. The Supreme Court is constituted as the protector and guarantor of Fundamental Rights.

**Article 32(2):** Supreme Court has power to issue directions, orders, or **writs** including:

## V. IMPORTANCE OF ARTICLE 32

### Dr. Ambedkar's Words

> "If I was asked to name any particular article in this Constitution as the most important – an article without which this Constitution would be a nullity – I could not refer to any other article except this one. It is the very soul of the Constitution and the very heart of it."

### Why "Heart and Soul"?

**1. Makes Rights Enforceable:**

- Article 32 gives teeth to Fundamental Rights

**2. Direct Access:**

- No need to go through lower courts

**3. Swift Justice:**
- Supreme Court acts promptly
- Writs provide quick remedy

- Constitutional duty to protect FR
- Cannot refuse jurisdiction

**5. Deterrent Effect:**
- Prevents State from violating rights
- Accountability ensured

## VIII. CONCLUSION

The **Right to Constitutional Remedies** under **Article 32** is the cornerstone of constitutional democracy in India. By providing **five powerful writs** – Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, Prohibition, Certiorari, and Quo Warranto – the Constitution ensures that Fundamental Rights are not merely theoretical but practically enforceable.

**Each writ serves specific purpose:**
- **Habeas Corpus** - Protects personal liberty
- **Mandamus** - Compels performance of duty
- **Prohibition** - Prevents excess of jurisdiction
- **Certiorari** - Quashes illegal orders
- **Quo Warranto** - Prevents usurpation of office

The Supreme Court, as guardian of Fundamental Rights under Article 32, and High Courts under Article 226 have used these writs creatively to:
- Protect individual liberty
- Ensure governmental accountability
- Enforce constitutional rights
- Promote social justice

As Justice Bhagwati observed:
> "Public interest litigation is a strategic arm of the legal aid movement which is intended to bring justice within the reach of the poor masses."

**Article 32 with its arsenal of five writs continues to be the most effective weapon in hands of citizens to enforce their constitutional rights and hold the State accountable to constitutional mandate.**
