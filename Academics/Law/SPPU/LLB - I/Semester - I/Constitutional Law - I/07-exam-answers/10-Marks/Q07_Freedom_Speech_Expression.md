## IV. LANDMARK JUDGMENTS

### 4.1 Romesh Thapar v. State of Madras (AIR 1950 SC 124)

**Facts:**

- Under Madras Maintenance of Public Order Act
- Ground: "Public safety and maintenance of public order"

- Original Article 19(2) had only "security of State"
- Cannot restrict on grounds not mentioned in Article 19(2)

### 4.2 Shreya Singhal v. Union of India (AIR 2015 SC 1523)

**Facts:**

- Criminalized sending "offensive," "menacing," or "causing annoyance" messages

   - Covers too much protected speech
   - Goes beyond reasonable restriction

3. **No Clear Procedure:**
   - No safeguards against misuse
   - Arbitrary arrests possible

4. **Chilling Effect:**
   - Creates fear of prosecution
   - Self-censorship
   - Stifles legitimate speech

**Principles Laid Down:**

1. **Discussion, Advocacy, and Incitement Distinguished:**
   - Discussion of ideas - Protected
   - Advocacy of causes - Protected
   - Incitement to imminent lawless action - Can be restricted

2. **Restriction Must Be Narrowly Drawn:**
   - Cannot be vague or overbroad
   - Must be specific and clear

3. **Same Standards for Online and Offline Speech:**
   - Article 19(1)(a) applies to all mediums
   - Internet not exception

**Significance:**
- Protected online free speech
- Set standards for internet regulation

## VII. CONCLUSION

**Freedom of Speech and Expression** under **Article 19(1)(a)** is the cornerstone of democracy and individual liberty. It enables citizens to express views, criticize government, access information, and participate in public discourse. The Supreme Court has recognized that this freedom includes **freedom of press**, **right to information**, **commercial speech**, and even **right to silence**.

However, recognizing that absolute freedom leads to anarchy and conflicts with other rights and public interest, the Constitution permits **reasonable restrictions** under **Article 19(2)** on **eight specified grounds**: sovereignty and integrity, security of State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, contempt of court, defamation, and incitement to offence.

The key word is **"reasonable"** - restrictions must be proportionate, necessary, and not arbitrary. Through landmark judgments like **Romesh Thapar**, **Sakal Papers**, and **Shreya Singhal**, the Supreme Court has evolved sophisticated jurisprudence ensuring:
- Freedom is protected robustly
- Restrictions are narrowly tailored
- Vague and overbroad laws are struck down
- Balance between liberty and public order

In the digital age, new challenges emerge - social media regulation, fake news, hate speech, internet shutdowns. The constitutional framework remains robust, but constant judicial vigilance is needed to ensure that **freedom remains the rule and restriction the exception**.

As Justice Holmes observed:
> "The best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market."

**Freedom of speech and expression, with reasonable restrictions, continues to be the pillar on which Indian democracy stands.**
