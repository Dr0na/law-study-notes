## Q.5) Explain rights of detenue under the preventive Detention Act / Article 22.

---

## I. INTRODUCTION

**Preventive detention** is detention of a person without trial to prevent him from committing a future act, not as punishment for past offense. It is **pre-emptive action** taken by State to maintain public order and national security.

**Article 22** of the Constitution provides safeguards against arrest and detention. While **Articles 22(1) and (2)** apply to all arrests, **Articles 22(3) to (7)** specifically deal with **preventive detention** and provide detailed safeguards to protect personal liberty of detenues.

**Constitutional Context:**
- Article 21 protects life and personal liberty
- Article 22 supplements Article 21 by providing procedural safeguards
- Balances State's power to detain with individual's liberty

## II. DISTINCTION: PUNITIVE VS PREVENTIVE DETENTION

| Basis | Punitive Detention | Preventive Detention |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Purpose** | Punishment for past offense | Prevention of future act |
| **When** | After trial and conviction | Before committing offense |
| **Duration** | Fixed by court sentence | As per detention law (max 3 months without Advisory Board) |
| **Trial** | After full trial | No trial |
| **Safeguards** | Article 22(1), (2) | Article 22(3) to (7) |
| **Nature** | Judicial | Administrative (with judicial review) |

**Right to be Informed of Grounds:**

**Two Important Rights:**

**A. Communication of Grounds (Article 22(5)):**

4. **National security** requires pre-emptive measures

**Safeguards Ensure:**
- Not arbitrary
- Subject to Advisory Board review
- Time-bound
- Subject to judicial review
- Grounds must be communicated
- Representation must be considered

---

## VIII. CONCLUSION

**Rights of detenue under preventive detention** represent a careful balance between individual liberty and State's need to maintain public order and national security. While **Article 22(1) and (2)** do not apply to preventive detenues, **Article 22(3) to (7)** provide special safeguards:

**Key Rights:**
1. **Communication of grounds** (Article 22(5))
2. **Right to make representation** (Article 22(5))
3. **Advisory Board review within 3 months** (Article 22(4))
4. **Maximum detention limit** prescribed by law (Article 22(4), (6))
5. **Judicial review** on limited grounds

**Advisory Board** (consisting of judges) acts as check on executive's power to detain, ensuring that detention is not arbitrary. Without Board's approval, detention cannot exceed **3 months**.

While preventive detention appears to contradict principles of personal liberty and rule of law, the Constitution recognizes that in extraordinary situations, State needs power to detain persons likely to act prejudicially. However, this power is **not absolute** and is subject to:
- Constitutional safeguards
- Advisory Board scrutiny
- Judicial review
- Time limits

Courts have consistently held that:
- Preventive detention is constitutional but must be used sparingly
- Procedural safeguards must be strictly followed
- Any violation renders detention invalid
- Liberty is precious and restrictions must be minimal

As the Supreme Court observed:
> "Personal liberty is too precious to be allowed to be encroached upon except to the limited extent permitted by the Constitution."

**The safeguards in Article 22 ensure that even when preventive detention is necessary, it operates within constitutional bounds, protecting individual liberty while enabling State to maintain security and public order.**
