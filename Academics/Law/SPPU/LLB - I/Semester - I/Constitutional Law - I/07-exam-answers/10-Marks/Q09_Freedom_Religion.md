## IX. CONCLUSION

**Freedom of Religion** under **Articles 25 to 28** is a comprehensive guarantee ensuring both individual and collective religious freedom in India's secular democratic framework. 

**Article 25** protects individual freedom of conscience, profession, practice, and propagation of religion, while **Article 26** protects collective rights of religious denominations to manage their affairs. **Articles 27 and 28** ensure that State does not use taxation or education for promoting particular religion.

**Indian secularism is unique** - not complete separation but equal distance from all religions with power to reform for social welfare. The State:
- Has no religion of its own
- Respects all religions equally
- Can intervene for social reform
- Cannot interfere with essential religious practices

Through the **essential religious practices test**, courts have balanced religious freedom with social reform, permitting State to regulate non-essential aspects while protecting the core of religious beliefs.

As held in **S.R. Bommai (1994)**, **secularism is a basic feature** of the Constitution, ensuring that India remains a land where all religions coexist peacefully with equal freedom and equal respect.

**Freedom of religion ensures that in India, every person is free to follow the religion of their choice, practice their faith, and propagate their beliefs - subject only to reasonable restrictions for maintaining public order, morality, health, and social reform.**
