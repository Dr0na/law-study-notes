# 10-MARK ANSWER

## Q.8) Explain the relationship between fundamental rights and Directive principles under the Indian Constitution.

---

## I. INTRODUCTION

The Indian Constitution contains **two sets of provisions** that together aim to establish a just social order:

**Part III (Articles 12-35):** Fundamental Rights (FR)  
**Part IV (Articles 36-51):** Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP)

Both are fundamental to governance but differ in nature, enforceability, and approach. The relationship between FR and DPSP has evolved through judicial interpretation from initial conflict to harmonious coexistence, and courts have declared that **harmony between FR and DPSP is a basic feature** of the Constitution.

---

## II. NATURE AND DISTINCTION

### Comparison Table

| Basis | Fundamental Rights (Part III) | Directive Principles (Part IV) |
|-------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Nature** | Civil and political rights | Socio-economic rights |
| **Enforceability** | **Justiciable** (enforceable in court) | **Non-justiciable** (not enforceable in court) |
| **Character** | **Negative** (State shall not...) | **Positive** (State shall...) |
| **Objective** | Individual liberty | Social welfare |
| **Binding** | Legally binding | Morally and politically binding |
| **Article 13** | Violative laws can be struck down | Failure to implement has no legal remedy |
| **Focus** | Individual vs State | State's duty to citizens |
| **Source** | British and American traditions | Irish Constitution |

**Dr. B.R. Ambedkar's Comparison:**
> "The Directive Principles resemble the Instrument of Instructions which were issued to the Governor-General and to the Governors by the British Government under the Government of India Act, 1935."

## III. EVOLUTION OF JUDICIAL VIEW ON RELATIONSHIP

### 3.1 Phase I: Conflict - FR Prevails (1950-1970)

#### State of Madras v. Champakam Dorairajan (AIR 1951 SC 226)

**Facts:**
- Madras Government issued order reserving seats in educational institutions based on caste and religion
- Aimed at implementing Article 46 (DPSP - promote SC/ST interests)
- Challenged as violating Article 15 (prohibition of discrimination based on religion, caste)

**Held:**
- **Fundamental Rights prevail over Directive Principles**
- FR are justiciable, DPSP are not
- In case of conflict, FR must prevail
- Government order struck down

**Ratio Decidendi:**
If there is conflict between FR and DPSP, FR prevails.

**Impact:**
- Established supremacy of FR
- Led to First Amendment (1951) inserting Article 15(4) to permit reservations
- Showed need for harmonization

---

### 3.2 Phase II: Harmonious Construction (1970-1980)

With the First Amendment enabling implementation of certain DPSPs even if they appeared to conflict with FR, the courts began adopting a harmonious approach.

#### Re Kerala Education Bill (AIR 1958 SC 956)

**Held:**
- FR and DPSP should be harmonized
- Constitution is organic whole
- Must be read together to achieve constitutional goals

---

### 3.3 Phase III: Harmony is Basic Feature (1973 onwards)

#### Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (AIR 1973 SC 1461)

**Held:**
- FR and DPSP are **supplementary and complementary**
- Both are essential for social revolution
- FR without DPSP = selfish individualism
- DPSP without FR = authoritarianism
- **Must be harmonized**

**Justice Khanna observed:**
> "The Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles represent the core of commitment to social revolution and constitutionalism."

**Significance:** Shifted from conflict to harmony approach.

---

#### Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India (AIR 1980 SC 1789) - LANDMARK

**Facts:**
- 42nd Amendment (1976) expanded Article 31C
- Original Article 31C (by 25th Amendment): Laws giving effect to Article 39(b) and (c) immune from challenge under Articles 14, 19
- 42nd Amendment: Extended immunity to laws giving effect to **ANY** Directive Principle
- Challenged as destroying balance

**Held:**

**Expanded Article 31C struck down as violating basic structure:**

**Justice Chandrachud (for majority):**
> **"The Constitution is founded on the bedrock of the balance between Parts III and IV. To destroy this balance is to destroy an essential element of the basic structure of the Constitution."**

**Key Principles:**

**1. Harmony is Basic Feature:**
- **Balance and harmony between FR and DPSP is basic feature** of Constitution
- Cannot be destroyed even by constitutional amendment
- Part III and IV are complementary organs

**2. Neither Can Override Completely:**
- FR cannot completely negate DPSP
- DPSP cannot completely override FR
- Balance must be maintained

**3. Limited Override Permitted:**
- Article 31C permits laws implementing Article 39(b) and (c) to override Articles 14, 19
- This limited override is constitutional
- But extending to ALL DPSP destroys harmony

**Ratio Decidendi:**
1. Harmony between FR (Part III) and DPSP (Part IV) is basic feature
2. Balance cannot be destroyed
3. FR and DPSP are complementary, not conflicting
4. Indian Constitution based on nice balance between individual rights and social control

**Significance:**
- Most important case on FR-DPSP relationship
- Declared harmony as basic feature
- Set constitutional limits on amendments
- Recognized need for balance

---

## IV. CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS BALANCING FR AND DPSP

### Article 31C (25th Amendment, 1971)

**Provision:**
Laws giving effect to **Article 39(b)** (preventing concentration of wealth) and **Article 39(c)** (equitable distribution of resources) immune from challenge under Articles 14 and 19.

**Effect:**
- Allows implementation of socialist DPSP
- Limited override of FR
- **Upheld as constitutional** in Minerva Mills

**But:** 42nd Amendment's expansion to ALL DPSP struck down.

---

### Article 15(4) (First Amendment, 1951)

**Inserted after Champakam Dorairajan case:**
> "Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes."

**Purpose:** Implement Article 46 (DPSP) - promotion of SC/ST interests.

**Effect:** Resolved conflict between Article 15 (equality) and Article 46 (DPSP).

---

### Article 16(4) (Original)

**Reservations in appointments:**
> "Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens."

**Purpose:** Implement DPSP principles of social justice.

---

### Article 21A (86th Amendment, 2002)

**Right to Education inserted as Fundamental Right:**
> "The State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years."

**Based on Article 45 (DPSP):** Free and compulsory education for children.

**Effect:** DPSP elevated to Fundamental Right.

---

## V. COMPLEMENTARY NATURE - HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER

### FR Provide Framework, DPSP Provide Direction

**Fundamental Rights:**
- Ensure civil and political liberties
- Protect individual from State
- Immediate enforceability
- Negative obligations (State shall not violate)

**Directive Principles:**
- Aim at social and economic transformation
- Guide State policy
- Progressive realization
- Positive obligations (State shall work towards)

**Together:**
- FR protect dignity and freedom
- DPSP ensure welfare and justice
- FR + DPSP = Complete constitutional vision

---

### Examples of Integration

**1. Right to Life (Article 21) + Health (Article 47):**
- Article 21 protects life
- Article 47 directs State to raise nutrition levels
- Courts have read right to health into Article 21 using Article 47

**2. Equality (Article 14) + Equal Justice (Article 39A):**
- Article 14 ensures equality before law
- Article 39A directs State to provide free legal aid
- Free legal aid made part of Article 21 and 14

**3. Freedom (Article 19) + Living Wage (Article 43):**
- Article 19(1)(g) protects freedom of profession
- Article 43 directs State to ensure living wage
- Minimum Wages Act implements both

---

## VI. CRITICISM AND RESPONSE

### Criticism of Differentiation

**Why different treatment?**
- Why FR justiciable but DPSP not?
- Why not make DPSP also enforceable?

**Response:**

**1. Resource Constraints:**
- DPSP implementation requires resources
- State may not have financial capacity
- Progressive realization needed

**2. Policy Matters:**
- DPSP involve policy choices
- Courts cannot decide policy
- Legislature and Executive better equipped

**3. Flexibility:**
- Non-justiciable nature allows flexibility
- State can prioritize based on needs
- No rigid enforcement

**4. Complementarity:**
- FR ensure minimum standards (immediately)
- DPSP set aspirational goals (progressively)
- Both necessary for complete constitutional vision

---

## VII. CONCLUSION

The relationship between **Fundamental Rights** and **Directive Principles** has evolved from initial conflict to mature harmony. The landmark judgment in **Minerva Mills (1980)** declared that **"harmony and balance between Part III (FR) and Part IV (DPSP) is a basic feature of the Constitution"** that cannot be destroyed even by constitutional amendment.

**This relationship is characterized by:**

**1. Complementarity:**
- FR and DPSP are not antagonistic but complementary
- Both aim at establishing just social order
- FR protect individual liberty, DPSP ensure social welfare

**2. Balance:**
- Neither can completely override the other
- Limited override permitted (Article 31C for Articles 39(b), (c))
- But complete override destroys basic structure

**3. Integration:**
- Courts have integrated DPSP into FR through creative interpretation
- Article 21 expanded using DPSP provisions
- Right to education, health, livelihood recognized

**4. Evolution:**
- From conflict (Champakam, 1951) - FR prevails
- To harmony (Kesavananda, 1973) - Both supplementary
- To basic feature (Minerva Mills, 1980) - Harmony cannot be destroyed

The framers' wisdom is evident in creating both FR and DPSP:
- **FR** ensure that while State works for social transformation, individual liberty is not sacrificed
- **DPSP** ensure that individual liberty does not perpetuate social and economic inequalities

As Justice Chandrachud beautifully stated in **Minerva Mills**:
> "The Indian Constitution is founded on a nice balance between individual rights and social control. To give absolute primacy to one over the other is to disturb the harmony of the Constitution."

**Together, Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles form the constitutional roadmap for transforming India into a just, equitable, and free society - balancing liberty with welfare, rights with duties, and individual dignity with collective good.**
