## Q. Protection of Right to Life and Personal Liberty with landmark cases.

---

## I. INTRODUCTION

**Article 21** of the Constitution of India is the most dynamic and expansive Fundamental Right. It provides:

> **"No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law."**

Originally conceived as a simple procedural safeguard, Article 21 has been transformed through judicial interpretation into a repository of numerous substantive rights. It forms part of the **"Golden Triangle"** of Articles 14, 19, and 21, which together constitute the core of Fundamental Rights in India.

**Applicability:** Article 21 protects **"any person"** - citizens and non-citizens alike - within the territory of India.

## II. EVOLUTION OF ARTICLE 21: FROM NARROW TO EXPANSIVE INTERPRETATION

### 2.1 Pre-Maneka Gandhi Era - Narrow Interpretation

#### A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras (AIR 1950 SC 27)

**Facts:**
- A.K. Gopalan detained under Preventive Detention Act
- Challenged detention as violating Articles 19, 21, and 22
- Argued "procedure established by law" must be just and fair

**Held:**
- **Narrow interpretation of Article 21 adopted**
- "Procedure established by law" means any law validly enacted by competent legislature
- Law need not be fair, just, or reasonable
- Article 21 does not incorporate "due process" doctrine
- Articles 19 and 21 are mutually exclusive

**Principle:**
If procedure prescribed by valid law is followed, person can be deprived of life or liberty even if procedure is unfair or unreasonable.

**Impact:**
- Limited protection under Article 21
- Procedural safeguard only
- Executive had wide powers

---

### 2.2 Maneka Gandhi Era - Paradigm Shift

#### Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (AIR 1978 SC 597)

**Facts:**
- Maneka Gandhi's passport impounded by Government under Section 10(3)(c) of Passports Act
- No opportunity of hearing given
- No reasons communicated
- Challenged as violating Articles 14, 19, and 21

**Issues:**
1. What is scope of "procedure established by law"?
2. Must procedure be fair and reasonable?
3. What is relationship between Articles 14, 19, and 21?

**Judgment:**

**Held:**

**1. Overruled A.K. Gopalan Partially:**
- "Procedure established by law" in Article 21 must be just, fair, and reasonable
- Not sufficient that law is validly enacted
- Procedure must also satisfy test of reasonableness under Article 14

**2. Golden Triangle Doctrine:**
> **"Articles 14, 19, and 21 form a 'Golden Triangle' - they are not mutually exclusive but overlapping and supplementary."**

- Any law depriving life or liberty must satisfy:
  - Article 14: Not arbitrary, reasonable
  - Article 19: Restrictions reasonable
  - Article 21: Procedure fair and just

**3. "Due Process" Introduced (Through Back Door):**
- Though Constitution says "procedure established by law" (not "due process")
- By requiring procedure to be fair, Court introduced essence of due process
- Brought Indian jurisprudence closer to American "due process"

**4. Principles Laid Down:**
- Right to be heard before adverse action
- Reasons must be communicated
- Opportunity to challenge decision
- Procedural fairness is constitutional requirement

**Ratio Decidendi:**
1. Procedure in Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable
2. Articles 14, 19, and 21 interconnected and complementary
3. Any law affecting personal liberty must pass test of all three articles

**Significance:**
- **Landmark judgment** transforming Article 21
- Shifted from procedure to substance
- Empowered courts to examine fairness of law
- Foundation for expansive interpretation

## VI. CONCLUSION

**Article 21** has emerged as the most dynamic and powerful Fundamental Right in the Indian Constitution. From the narrow interpretation in **A.K. Gopalan (1950)** to the expansive vision in **Maneka Gandhi (1978)** and subsequent cases, Article 21 has been transformed into a reservoir of substantive rights.

The Supreme Court's creative interpretation has read numerous rights into Article 21:
- Right to livelihood, speedy trial, legal aid
- Right to health, education, shelter
- Right to clean environment
- Right to privacy
- Right to die with dignity

**"Life" under Article 21 does not mean mere animal existence but life with human dignity, encompassing all facets that make life worth living.**

The **Golden Triangle doctrine** (Articles 14, 19, 21) ensures that any law affecting life or liberty must pass the test of reasonableness, fairness, and justice. This has shifted Indian jurisprudence from procedural protection to substantive justice.

As Justice Bhagwati observed in **Francis Coralie case**:
> "The right to life enshrined in Article 21 cannot be restricted to mere animal existence. It means something much more than just physical survival."

**Article 21 continues to evolve, responding to emerging challenges and ensuring that the constitutional promise of life and liberty remains meaningful and relevant for every person in India.**
