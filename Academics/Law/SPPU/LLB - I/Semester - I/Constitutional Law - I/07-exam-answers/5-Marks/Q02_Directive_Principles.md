## VIII. CONCLUSION

**Directive Principles of State Policy** are conscience of the Constitution. Though non-justiciable, they are fundamental in governance and impose moral duty on State to work towards socio-economic justice. They represent the vision of framers to transform India into a welfare state.

DPSP complement Fundamental Rights:
- **FR:** Negative rights (State shall not violate)
- **DPSP:** Positive duties (State shall work towards)

As Dr. Ambedkar observed:
> "The Directive Principles resemble the Instrument of Instructions which were issued to the Governor-General and to the Governors of the Colonies by the British Government under the Government of India Act, 1935."

The Supreme Court has recognized that **harmony between Fundamental Rights and DPSP is a basic feature** of the Constitution (**Minerva Mills**). Both must be read together to realize constitutional goals of justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity.

While implementation remains a challenge, DPSP continue to guide policy-making and legislation, gradually transforming India's socio-economic landscape.
