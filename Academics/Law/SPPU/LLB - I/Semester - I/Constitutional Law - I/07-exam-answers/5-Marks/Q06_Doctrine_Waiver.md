## Q. Doctrine of Waiver (Part C - Option c)

---

## I. INTRODUCTION

**Doctrine of Waiver** refers to the voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right. In context of **Fundamental Rights**, it raises the question: **Can a person waive (give up) his Fundamental Rights?**

**Article 13** declares that laws inconsistent with Fundamental Rights shall be void. This protects Fundamental Rights from legislative encroachment. But can an individual himself choose to waive his rights?

The Supreme Court has generally held that **Fundamental Rights cannot be waived** as they are public rights created for public good, not merely private rights.

---

## II. GENERAL PRINCIPLE

### Fundamental Rights Cannot Be Waived

**Reason:**

**1. Public Rights:**
- Fundamental Rights are not private rights
- Created for public purpose
- Safeguard constitutional democracy

**2. Constitutional Mandate:**
- Rights enshrined in Constitution
- Not subject to individual whim
- Cannot be bargained away

**3. Public Policy:**
- Waiver would defeat constitutional purpose
- Opens door to exploitation
- Vulnerable may be forced to waive

**Case Law:** **Basheshar Nath v. Commissioner of Income Tax (AIR 1959 SC 149)**
- Fundamental Rights cannot generally be waived
- Public rights, not private
- Created for public good

---

## III. EXCEPTIONS - WHEN WAIVER POSSIBLE

### Limited Waiver in Certain Circumstances

While general rule is that FR cannot be waived, courts have recognized limited exceptions:

#### 1. Article 19 Freedoms - Temporary Suspension

**Voluntary Contracts:**
- Person can enter into contract that temporarily limits freedom
- Example: Employment contract with confidentiality clause (limits freedom of speech)
- Service contract with geographical restriction (limits freedom of movement)

**Condition:** Must be:
- Voluntary
- Reasonable
- Temporary
- Not against public policy

**Case Law:** **T.M.A. Pai Foundation (2002)** - Students voluntarily joining institution must follow rules.

---

#### 2. Right to Property (Before 1978)

**Consent to Acquisition:**
- Person could consent to acquisition of property by State
- Waiver of right to compensation
- But now right to property not a Fundamental Right (Article 300A)

---

#### 3. Procedural Rights

**Certain procedural rights can be waived:**
- Right to notice (if person waives voluntarily)
- Right to hearing (if person chooses not to participate)

**But:** Substantive rights cannot be waived.

---

## IV. RIGHTS THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED

### Absolute Prohibition on Waiver

**The following Fundamental Rights CANNOT be waived under any circumstances:**

**1. Article 14 (Equality):**
- Cannot agree to discriminatory treatment
- Would perpetuate inequality

**2. Article 17 (Abolition of Untouchability):**
- Cannot agree to practice untouchability
- Against public policy
- Social evil

**3. Article 23 (Prohibition of Traffic and Forced Labour):**
- Cannot agree to be trafficked or enslaved
- Human dignity cannot be bargained
- Against constitutional morality

**4. Article 24 (Prohibition of Child Labour):**
- Child cannot waive (lacks capacity)
- Parents cannot waive on child's behalf
- Protection of vulnerable

**5. Essential Right to Life and Liberty (Article 21):**
- Core aspects cannot be waived
- Right to live with dignity non-negotiable
- Cannot consent to torture or inhuman treatment

---

## V. RATIONALE

### Why Waiver Generally Not Permitted

**1. Inequality of Bargaining Power:**
- Economically weak may be forced to waive
- Creates exploitation
- Vulnerable sections at risk

**2. Public Interest:**
- FR created for public good
- Not just individual benefit
- Protect constitutional democracy

**3. Constitutional Morality:**
- Constitution embodies collective wisdom
- Individual cannot defeat constitutional purpose
- Higher values protected

**4. Inalienable Rights:**
- Some rights fundamental to human dignity
- Cannot be surrendered
- Inherent in human personality

---

## VI. DISTINCTION: WAIVER VS SURRENDER

**Waiver:**
- Voluntary relinquishment of right
- Intentional giving up
- With knowledge

**Surrender:**
- Giving up under pressure
- Not truly voluntary
- Often forced

**Only true waiver (voluntary, informed, free) may be valid for certain rights.**

**Surrender under coercion is NOT waiver and is invalid.**

---

## VII. CASE LAWS

### Basheshar Nath v. CIT (AIR 1959 SC 149)

**Held:**
- Fundamental Rights generally cannot be waived
- They are public rights
- Created for public good and public interest

### Behram Khurshid Pesikaka v. State of Bombay (AIR 1955 SC 123)

**Held:**
- Person cannot waive protection of Article 20(3) (self-incrimination)
- Constitutional safeguard cannot be bargained away

### Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corporation (1985)

**Held:**
- Right to livelihood (Article 21) cannot be waived
- Even if person agrees, State cannot deprive without due process

---

## VIII. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS

**Employment Contracts:**
- Cannot include clause waiving Fundamental Rights completely
- But reasonable restrictions during employment valid
- Example: Confidentiality during service period

**Settlement Agreements:**
- Constitutional rights cannot be subject of settlement
- Private arrangement cannot override constitutional mandate

**Consent:**
- Informed consent to medical treatment valid
- But cannot consent to violation of dignity or torture

---

## IX. CONCLUSION

The **Doctrine of Waiver** holds that **Fundamental Rights generally cannot be waived** as they are public rights created for public good and constitutional democracy. They are not merely private rights that individuals can bargain away.

However, **limited exceptions** exist for:
- Temporary, voluntary, reasonable restrictions in contracts
- Certain procedural rights
- Where waiver doesn't affect public interest

**But absolute prohibition** on waiver of:
- Right to equality
- Right against exploitation
- Right to life and dignity
- Abolition of untouchability

As held in **Basheshar Nath case**, Fundamental Rights are constitutional mandates that protect not just individual interests but also public interest and constitutional morality. **Allowing waiver would defeat the very purpose of enshrining these rights in the Constitution.**

The underlying principle is that **certain rights are so fundamental to human dignity and constitutional democracy that they cannot be surrendered, even voluntarily.**
