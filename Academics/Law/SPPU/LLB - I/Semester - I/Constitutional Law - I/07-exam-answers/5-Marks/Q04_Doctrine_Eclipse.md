## Q. Doctrine of Eclipse (Part C - Option d)

---

## I. INTRODUCTION

**Doctrine of Eclipse** is a constitutional doctrine evolved by the Supreme Court under **Article 13** of the Constitution. Article 13(1) provides:

> "All laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution, in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Part (Fundamental Rights), shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void."

The question arose: Does "void" mean **"void ab initio"** (void from beginning) or **"inoperative/eclipsed"**?

**Doctrine of Eclipse:** Pre-constitutional laws inconsistent with Fundamental Rights are not **void** but merely **eclipsed** (inoperative). They remain alive but dormant. If Fundamental Right removed by constitutional amendment, the law revives automatically.

---

## II. CONCEPT AND MEANING

### Eclipse vs Void

**Eclipse (Shadow):**
- Law exists but is overshadowed
- Temporarily inoperative
- Can revive if shadow removed

**Void:**
- Law destroyed
- Never existed
- Cannot revive

**Doctrine of Eclipse holds:** Pre-constitutional law violating FR is eclipsed (not destroyed).

## III. LANDMARK CASE: BHIKAJI NARAIN v. STATE OF M.P. (AIR 1955 SC 781)

**Facts:**
- C.P. and Berar Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 1947 (pre-Constitution law)
- Required permit for stage carriages on any route
- Violated Article 19(1)(g) (freedom to carry on trade and business)
- In 1951, Constitution (First Amendment) added Article 19(6)
- New Article 19(6) permitted such restrictions
- Question: Does 1947 Act revive after First Amendment?

**Issue:**
Is pre-constitutional law violating FR "void ab initio" or merely "eclipsed"?

**Held:**

**Doctrine of Eclipse propounded:**

**1. Pre-Constitutional Laws:**
- Laws existing before Constitution are NOT void
- Merely **eclipsed** (overshadowed) by Fundamental Rights
- Law exists but inoperative
- Like sun during eclipse - exists but obscured

**2. Revival Upon Removal of Shadow:**
- If Fundamental Right removed or modified by constitutional amendment
- Pre-constitutional law **automatically revives**
- No need for re-enactment
- Shadow removed, sun shines again

**3. Only for Pre-Constitutional Laws:**
- Doctrine applies only to laws existing before Constitution (26 Jan 1950)
- Post-constitutional laws violating FR are **void ab initio** (dead from birth)
- Cannot revive

**Application to Facts:**
- 1947 Act was eclipsed by Article 19(1)(g) in 1950
- First Amendment (1951) added Article 19(6) permitting such restrictions
- Eclipse removed
- 1947 Act **automatically revived** and became operative

**Ratio Decidendi:**
1. Pre-constitutional laws violating FR are eclipsed, not void
2. They revive automatically if FR removed or modified
3. No re-enactment necessary
4. Doctrine applies only to pre-constitutional laws

---

## IV. RATIONALE FOR DOCTRINE

**Why Eclipse and Not Void?**

**1. Historical Continuity:**
- Laws made before Constitution with proper authority
- Should not be destroyed completely
- Framers intended continuation subject to FR

**2. Article 13(1) Language:**
- Says "void" but doesn't say "void ab initio"
- Interpreted as inoperative, not destroyed

**3. Practical Consideration:**
- If FR removed, law can operate without re-enactment
- Legislative convenience
- Certainty

**4. Constitutional Interpretation:**
- Pre-constitutional laws made without knowledge of FR
- Not made in defiance of Constitution
- Deserve different treatment than post-constitutional laws

---

## V. APPLICABILITY

### When Doctrine Applies

**✓ Applies to:**
- Pre-constitutional laws (before 26 January 1950)
- Laws inconsistent with Fundamental Rights
- When FR later removed/modified by constitutional amendment

**✗ Does NOT apply to:**
- Post-constitutional laws (after 26 January 1950)
- These are **void ab initio** (dead from birth)
- Cannot revive even if FR removed

**Reason for Distinction:**
- Post-constitutional laws made with knowledge of FR
- Made in defiance of Constitution
- Deserve harsher treatment

---

## VI. EFFECT ON CITIZENS

**Important Distinction:**

**1. Against Citizens:**
- Pre-constitutional law eclipsed
- Cannot be enforced against citizens
- Citizens protected by FR

**2. Against Non-Citizens:**
- Same law may be enforceable against non-citizens
- FR (like Article 19) available only to citizens
- Law not eclipsed vis-à-vis non-citizens

**Example:**
Pre-constitutional law restricting freedom of profession:
- Eclipsed against Indian citizens (who have Article 19(1)(g))
- Enforceable against foreigners (who don't have Article 19 rights)

---

## VII. EXAMPLES

**Example 1:**
- Pre-1950 law restricts freedom of speech
- Violates Article 19(1)(a)
- Law eclipsed from 1950
- If Article 19(1)(a) removed by amendment (hypothetically), law revives

**Example 2:**
- C.P. Berar Motor Vehicles Act, 1947 (actual case)
- Violated Article 19(1)(g)
- Eclipsed from 1950
- First Amendment (1951) added Article 19(6)
- Law revived automatically

---

## VIII. COMPARISON: ECLIPSE VS SEVERABILITY

| Doctrine of Eclipse | Doctrine of Severability |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| For pre-constitutional laws | For all laws (pre and post) |
| Law eclipsed, not destroyed | Bad part severed, good part remains |
| Can revive if FR removed | Severed part cannot revive |
| Applies to entire law | Applies to part of law |
| Temporary inoperativeness | Permanent separation |

---

## IX. CONCLUSION

The **Doctrine of Eclipse** is a unique constitutional doctrine that treats pre-constitutional laws inconsistent with Fundamental Rights as **eclipsed (overshadowed)** rather than void. Established in **Bhikaji Narain v. State of M.P. (1955)**, the doctrine holds that such laws remain dormant and revive automatically if the conflicting Fundamental Right is removed or modified by constitutional amendment.

This doctrine:
- Recognizes distinction between pre and post-constitutional laws
- Provides historical continuity
- Ensures that pre-constitutional laws (made without knowledge of FR) are not destroyed but merely suspended
- Operates like eclipse - sun (law) hidden by moon (FR), but reappears when moon moves

**The doctrine applies ONLY to pre-constitutional laws (before 26 Jan 1950). Post-constitutional laws violating FR are void ab initio and cannot revive.**

**Key Points:**
1. Article 13(1) and Article 20(2) are different - don't confuse!
2. Eclipse = Inoperative but exists, can revive
3. Bhikaji Narain case (1955)
4. Only for PRE-constitutional laws
5. Post-constitutional laws = void ab initio
6. Example: Motor Vehicles Act 1947

**Revision Tip:** Remember "Eclipse" metaphor - sun hidden by moon, reappears when moon moves. PRE vs POST distinction is crucial.
