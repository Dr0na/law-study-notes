## VII. SIGNIFICANCE

**Broad Interpretation of "State":**
- Expands reach of Fundamental Rights
- More entities accountable
- Ensures government cannot escape constitutional obligations by creating separate entities
- Promotes constitutional accountability

**Functional Approach:**
- Courts look at substance, not form
- Focus on functions performed
- Government control is key factor

---

## VIII. CONCLUSION

**Article 12** definition of "State" has been given expansive interpretation by the Supreme Court. Through landmark cases like **Ajay Hasia** and **Pradeep Kumar Biswas**, the Court has evolved a functional test to determine whether an entity is "State." The test focuses on:
- Government funding
- Government control
- Public functions
- State instrumentality

This expansive interpretation ensures that Fundamental Rights cannot be defeated by creating autonomous or semi-autonomous bodies. If an entity is deep and pervasive controlled by Government and performs public functions, it is "State" under Article 12 and bound by Fundamental Rights.
