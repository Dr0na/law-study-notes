## Q. Double Jeopardy (Part C - Option a)

---

## I. INTRODUCTION

**Double Jeopardy** is a constitutional protection guaranteed under **Article 20(2)** of the Constitution of India. It provides:

> **"No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once."**

This safeguard ensures that once a person has been tried and punished for an offense, he cannot be tried and punished again for the same offense. It protects individuals from harassment through repeated trials and prevents State from using its vast resources to harass citizens.

---

## II. ORIGIN

The principle of double jeopardy is based on the **Latin maxim:**

**"Nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa"**

**Meaning:** No man should be vexed (troubled) twice for the same cause.

**Also expressed as:** *"Autrefois acquit"* (previously acquitted) or *"Autrefois convict"* (previously convicted)

Borrowed from **English Common Law** and **Fifth Amendment of U.S. Constitution**.

---

## III. ESSENTIAL CONDITIONS FOR ARTICLE 20(2)

For protection of Article 20(2) to apply, **THREE conditions must be satisfied:**

**1. Person Must Have Been Prosecuted:**
- Actual prosecution necessary
- Mere investigation or inquiry not sufficient
- Prosecution must have been before court of law

**2. Prosecution Must Be by Court or Judicial Tribunal:**
- Not departmental proceedings
- Not administrative inquiry
- Must be judicial proceeding

**3. For the Same Offence:**
- Offence must be identical
- Not merely similar
- Ingredients of offense same

**If all three conditions satisfied → Cannot be prosecuted again.**

---

## IV. SCOPE AND MEANING

### "Same Offence"

**When is offence "same"?**

**Test:** If facts constituting one offense also constitute the other offense, they are same.

**Examples:**

**Same Offence (Double jeopardy applies):**
- Person convicted for theft of particular property → Cannot be prosecuted again for same theft
- Acquitted of murder → Cannot be tried again for same murder

**Different Offences (Double jeopardy does NOT apply):**
- Single act may constitute multiple offenses
- Example: Driving rashly and under influence → Two separate offenses
- Can be prosecuted for both

---

## V. IMPORTANT CASE LAWS

### Maqbool Hussain v. State of Bombay (AIR 1953 SC 325)

**Facts:**
- Gold smuggled into India, confiscated by customs
- Later prosecuted under criminal law for same smuggling
- Pleaded double jeopardy

**Held:**
- **No double jeopardy**
- Confiscation by customs = administrative action (not prosecution)
- Criminal prosecution = different proceeding
- Both can proceed
- Article 20(2) applies only when prosecuted by court, not departmental action

**Ratio:** Departmental or administrative proceedings ≠ prosecution by court.

---

### S.A. Venkataraman v. Union of India (AIR 1954 SC 375)

- Not double jeopardy
- Different nature and consequences

---

### Thomas Dana v. State of Punjab (AIR 1959 SC 375)

- Both are separate and distinct

---

## VI. WHAT IS NOT DOUBLE JEOPARDY

**Following are NOT double jeopardy:**

**1. Departmental Proceedings + Criminal Trial:**
- Both can proceed independently
- Different objectives (discipline vs punishment)

**2. Civil Case + Criminal Case:**
- For same act, both civil suit and criminal prosecution possible
- Example: Assault → Civil damages + Criminal punishment

**3. Appeals and Revisions:**
- Filing appeal or revision not double jeopardy
- Same proceeding continuing

**4. Retrial:**
- If conviction set aside on technical grounds
- Retrial not barred
- Fresh trial = continuation of same prosecution

**5. Different Offences:**
- Single act constituting multiple offenses
- Can be prosecuted for each

---

## VII. DISTINCTION: ARTICLE 20(2) AND SECTION 300 CrPC

**Article 20(2):** Constitutional protection - prosecution and punishment

**Section 300 CrPC:** Statutory protection - once convicted or acquitted, no fresh trial for same offense

**Broader Protection:** Section 300 CrPC broader than Article 20(2)
- Covers conviction OR acquittal (Article 20(2) requires prosecution AND punishment)
- Once acquitted, cannot be tried again even though not punished

---

## VIII. SIGNIFICANCE

**Protection Against:**
1. Harassment through repeated trials
2. Abuse of State power
3. Prolonged litigation
4. Multiple punishments for same act

**Ensures:**
1. Finality of judgment
2. Certainty in law
3. Individual security
4. Fair trial

---

## IX. CONCLUSION

**Double Jeopardy** under **Article 20(2)** is a significant constitutional safeguard protecting individuals from being prosecuted and punished more than once for the same offense. It ensures:
- Finality of judicial proceedings
- Protection from harassment
- Fair trial guarantee

The protection applies only when there has been prosecution by a court for the same offense. **Departmental proceedings, administrative inquiries, or civil cases are not covered.** As held in **Maqbool Hussain case**, both administrative action and criminal prosecution can proceed independently.

This safeguard reflects the constitutional commitment to fairness and the principle that once a person has faced justice for an act, the State cannot repeatedly put him through the ordeal of trial and punishment.
