## V. CONCLUSION

**Minorities in India enjoy five major constitutional rights** under **Articles 29 and 30**:

1. **Conserve language, script, culture** (Article 29(1))
2. **Non-discrimination in admission** to State institutions (Article 29(2))
3. **Establish and administer educational institutions** (Article 30(1))
4. **Non-discrimination in State aid** (Article 30(2))
5. **Autonomy with reasonable regulation** (from case laws)

These rights ensure that minorities can preserve their distinct identity while participating fully in national mainstream. The Constitution balances minority rights with regulatory power of State, ensuring that **autonomy does not mean anarchy** and **regulation does not mean takeover**.
