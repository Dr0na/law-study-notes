**Social Justice:** DPSP implementation justified using "justice" in Preamble.

## IX. CONCLUSION

The statement **"Preamble is the key to open the minds of the makers"** is profoundly true. The Preamble reveals:

**The Framers' Vision for India:**
- **Sovereign** - Free from all subjugation
- **Socialist** - Economically just society
- **Secular** - Harmonious coexistence of all religions
- **Democratic** - Government by and for the people
- **Republic** - Merit-based, no hereditary privileges

**The Framers' Objectives:**
- **Justice** (social, economic, political) - Comprehensive fairness
- **Liberty** (thought, expression, belief, faith, worship) - Individual freedom
- **Equality** (status, opportunity) - Substantive, not merely formal
- **Fraternity** (dignity, unity, integrity) - Social cohesion

**The Framers' Experience and Context:**
- Colonial subjugation → Sovereignty emphasized
- Partition and communal violence → Secularism and fraternity stressed
- Social hierarchies and discrimination → Equality and justice prioritized
- Suppression of freedoms → Liberty cherished
- Economic exploitation → Socialist principles adopted

Through the Preamble, we understand that the framers:
- Had experienced oppression and wanted freedom
- Witnessed inequality and sought justice
- Saw division and desired unity
- Dreamed of dignity for all Indians

As the Supreme Court observed in **LIC v. Manubhai Shah (1992)**:
> "The Preamble is a part of the Constitution and can be referred to for the purpose of interpreting the provisions of the Constitution."

And in **Kesavananda Bharati (1973)**:
> "The Preamble to our Constitution embodies a great vision and objectives which the founding fathers had set out."

**The Preamble is indeed the key that unlocks the minds of the makers, revealing their hopes, fears, experiences, and dreams for India - a nation they envisioned as sovereign and free, just and equal, secular and united, democratic and republican.**

It shows that the Constitution is not just a legal document but a **social contract** and a **transformative vision** for building a new India based on the noble ideals of **justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity**.

As **Dr. B.R. Ambedkar** stated:
> "The Constitution is not a mere lawyer's document, it is a vehicle of Life, and its spirit is always the spirit of Age."

**The Preamble captures this spirit - it is the window into the souls of the makers, showing us the India they dreamed of and the Constitution they created to realize that dream.**
