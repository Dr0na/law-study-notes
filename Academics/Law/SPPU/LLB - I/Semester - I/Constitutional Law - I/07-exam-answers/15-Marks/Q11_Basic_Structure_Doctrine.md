# 15-MARK ANSWER

## Q. Discuss the Basic Structure Doctrine of the Constitution with landmark case laws.

---

## I. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Concept of Basic Structure Doctrine

The **Basic Structure Doctrine** is a judicial innovation that holds that certain features of the Constitution are so fundamental that they cannot be amended even by Parliament exercising its constituent power under **Article 368**. While Parliament has wide power to amend the Constitution, it cannot alter or destroy the basic structure or framework of the Constitution.

This doctrine is one of the most significant contributions of Indian constitutional jurisprudence and has no parallel in most other constitutions of the world.

### 1.2 Constitutional Context

**Article 368** provides the power and procedure for amending the Constitution:
- Parliament can amend any provision of Constitution
- But can it amend **everything**?
- Can it destroy the very identity of Constitution?
- Can it convert democracy into dictatorship?

These questions led to the evolution of the Basic Structure Doctrine.

### 1.3 Significance

The Basic Structure Doctrine:
1. **Limits Parliamentary power** - Even constituent power has limits
2. **Protects Constitution's core** - Identity cannot be destroyed
3. **Judicial review of amendments** - Courts can strike down amendments
4. **Balance of power** - Between Parliament and Judiciary
5. **Continuity of Constitution** - Core values remain constant

---

## II. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND - PRE-BASIC STRUCTURE ERA

### 2.1 Shankari Prasad v. Union of India (AIR 1951 SC 458)

**Facts:**
- First Amendment Act (1951) challenged
- Added Ninth Schedule to protect land reform laws
- Contended that Fundamental Rights cannot be amended

**Issue:**
Can Parliament amend Fundamental Rights under Article 368?

**Held:**
- **Parliament can amend Fundamental Rights**
- Article 13 (which prohibits "law" violating FR) does not include constitutional amendments
- Amendment is not "law" under Article 13
- Article 368 is independent power

**Ratio:** Amendment is not "law" within meaning of Article 13; Parliament can amend any part including Fundamental Rights.

---

### 2.2 Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan (AIR 1965 SC 845)

**Facts:**
- 17th Amendment challenged
- Added more items to Ninth Schedule

**Held:**
- **Reaffirmed Shankari Prasad**
- Parliament can amend any part of Constitution including FR
- But Justice Hidayatullah (dissent) gave warning:
  > "The Constitution is a precious heritage; therefore, you cannot destroy its identity."

**Significance:** Seeds of doubt sown about unlimited power of amendment.

---

### 2.3 I.C. Golak Nath v. State of Punjab (AIR 1967 SC 1643)

**Facts:**
- Punjab land reform laws challenged
- 17th Amendment validity questioned

**Held (by majority 6:5):**
- **Parliament CANNOT amend Fundamental Rights**
- **Overruled Shankari Prasad and Sajjan Singh**
- Amendment is "law" under Article 13
- Rights are "transcendental and immutable"

**But Applied Prospectively:**
- Past amendments valid
- Future amendments affecting FR invalid

**Dissent:** Justice Hidayatullah and others - Parliament should have power to amend.

**Impact:**
- Created constitutional crisis
- Parliament lost power to amend FR
- Government felt need to restore amendment power

---

## III. PARLIAMENT'S RESPONSE - 24TH AMENDMENT (1971)

### Parliament's Reaction to Golak Nath

**24th Constitutional Amendment Act (1971) introduced:**

**1. New Article 13(4):**
> "Nothing in this article shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution made under Article 368."
- Clarified that amendment is not "law" under Article 13

**2. Amendment to Article 368:**
- Added obligation to give assent to Constitution Amendment Bill
- Made President bound to give assent

**3. Changed "amend" to "add, vary, or repeal":**
- Enlarged scope of amendment power
- Made it clear that Article 368 is constituent power

**Purpose:** Overcome Golak Nath judgment and restore Parliament's power to amend FR.

**But:** Led to challenge in Kesavananda Bharati case.

---

### 5.2 Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India (AIR 1980 SC 1789)

**Facts:**
- 42nd Amendment (1976) challenged
- Called "Mini Constitution" - 59 amendments made during Emergency
- Two crucial additions to Article 368:
  - **Clause 4:** "No amendment shall be questioned in any court on any ground"
  - **Clause 5:** "No limitation on constituent power of Parliament"
- Also expanded Article 31C to cover ALL Directive Principles

**Issues:**
1. Can Parliament exclude judicial review of amendments?
2. Can Parliament claim unlimited constituent power?
3. Can Article 31C be expanded to all DPSP?

**Held:**

**1. Clauses 4 and 5 of Article 368 STRUCK DOWN:**

**Clause 4 Invalid:**
- Cannot exclude judicial review
- Judicial review is basic feature
- Would make limited Constitution unlimited
- Parliament would become supreme over Constitution

**Clause 5 Invalid:**
- Parliament's amendment power is limited by basic structure
- Saying it is unlimited violates basic structure itself
- Limited Constitution cannot be made unlimited

**2. Expanded Article 31C STRUCK DOWN:**

**Original Article 31C (by 25th Amendment):**
- Laws giving effect to Article 39(b) and (c) protected from challenge under Articles 14, 19

**42nd Amendment Expansion:**
- Extended protection to laws implementing ANY Directive Principle
- Struck down as violating harmony between FR and DPSP

**Held:**
> **"Harmony and balance between Fundamental Rights (Part III) and Directive Principles (Part IV) is a basic feature of the Constitution."**

- If all DPSP can override FR, balance destroyed
- Basic structure violated

---

### Key Observations by Justice Bhagwati

> "The Constitution is founded on the bedrock of the balance between Parts III and IV. To destroy this balance is to destroy an essential element of the basic structure of the Constitution."

> "The Indian Constitution is founded on a nice balance between individual rights and social control. To give absolute primacy to one over the other is to disturb the harmony of the Constitution."

---

### Ratio Decidendi

1. **Judicial review cannot be excluded** - It is basic feature
2. **Parliament's power is limited** - Cannot be made unlimited by amendment
3. **Harmony between FR and DPSP** is basic feature
4. **Limited Constitution cannot become unlimited**

**Significance:**
- Most important case after Kesavananda Bharati
- Actually struck down provisions
- Clarified scope of Basic Structure Doctrine
- Protected judicial review

---

### 5.3 Waman Rao v. Union of India (AIR 1981 SC 271)

**Facts:**
- Validity of Ninth Schedule challenged
- Laws placed in Ninth Schedule immune from FR challenge

**Held:**

**1. Ninth Schedule Valid (up to Kesavananda Bharati date):**

- Cannot be challenged

**2. Post-Kesavananda Additions Can Be Challenged:**
- Laws added after 24 April 1973 can be tested against basic structure
- If they violate basic structure, can be struck down
- Ninth Schedule not absolute protection

**Ratio:** Ninth Schedule valid but subject to basic structure limitation for post-1973 additions.

**Significance:** Applied Basic Structure Doctrine to Ninth Schedule.

## X. CONCLUSION

The **Basic Structure Doctrine** is one of the most significant contributions of the Indian Supreme Court to constitutional jurisprudence. Evolved through the landmark judgment in **Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973)**, the doctrine establishes that while Parliament has wide power to amend the Constitution under **Article 368**, it cannot alter or destroy the **basic structure or essential features** of the Constitution.

**The doctrine represents a delicate balance:**
- **Parliament's constituent power** is acknowledged
- **But it is limited** by the Constitution's core identity
- **Judicial review** ensures amendments don't destroy democracy

**Through cases like:**
- **Kesavananda Bharati (1973)** - Doctrine established
- **Minerva Mills (1980)** - Applied and strengthened
- **S.R. Bommai (1994)** - Secularism identified as basic feature
- **I.R. Coelho (2007)** - Ninth Schedule laws can be reviewed

The Supreme Court has developed a robust framework protecting the Constitution's soul while allowing flexibility for socio-economic changes.

**The basic features identified include:**
- Supremacy of Constitution
- Democratic and republican government
- Secularism
- Separation of powers
- Judicial review
- Rule of law
- Harmony between FR and DPSP
- Free and fair elections

While criticized as judicial overreach by some, the doctrine has proved essential, especially after the experience of the **Emergency (1975-77)** when the 42nd Amendment tried to make Parliament supreme over the Constitution. **Minerva Mills** case vindicated the doctrine by striking down provisions that would have destroyed constitutional democracy.

As Justice Mathew observed:
> "The basic structure concept gives stability and continuity to the Constitution without fossilizing it."

**The Basic Structure Doctrine ensures that:**
- Democracy cannot be converted into dictatorship
- Republic cannot become monarchy
- Secular cannot become theocratic
- Federal cannot become unitary

**It is the guardian of constitutional identity, ensuring that "We, the People of India" remain sovereign, and the Constitution remains the supreme law that even Parliament cannot destroy.**

**Key Points to Remember:**
1. Definition and significance of Basic Structure Doctrine
2. Pre-Kesavananda era (Shankari Prasad, Sajjan Singh, Golak Nath)
3. Kesavananda Bharati (1973) - 13-judge bench, 7:6 majority
4. Basic features identified (at least 8-10)
5. Minerva Mills (1980) - Clauses 4 & 5 struck down, FR-DPSP harmony
6. Other cases (Indira Gandhi, S.R. Bommai, I.R. Coelho)
7. Criticism and justification
8. Conclusion emphasizing balance

**Revision Tip:** 
- **Timeline:** Shankari Prasad (1951) → Sajjan Singh (1965) → Golak Nath (1967) → 24th Amendment (1971) → Kesavananda Bharati (1973) → Minerva Mills (1980)
- **Remember:** Golak Nath said Parliament CANNOT amend FR; Kesavananda Bharati said CAN amend but not basic structure
- **Minerva Mills**: Remember two things struck down - Clauses 4 & 5 of Article 368, and expanded Article 31C

**Exam Strategy:** 
This question appears in 80% of exams. Highly scoring if you know the case progression. Must mention Kesavananda Bharati in detail (it's the foundation). Minerva Mills is equally important (it applied the doctrine). List at least 8-10 basic features. This is examiner's favorite - demonstrates deep understanding of constitutional law!
