## I. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Definition of Public Interest Litigation

**Public Interest Litigation (PIL)** is a strategic arm of legal aid movement that aims to bring justice within the reach of poor masses who face social, economic, and political disadvantages. It is a legal action initiated in a court of law for the enforcement of public interest or general interest in which the public or a class of community has pecuniary or proprietary interest.

PIL represents a relaxation of the traditional rule of **locus standi**, which required that only a person who has suffered a legal injury can approach the court. In PIL, any public-spirited person or organization can move the court on behalf of those who are unable to approach the court due to poverty, ignorance, or socially or economically disadvantaged position.

### 1.2 Constitutional Basis

The constitutional foundation of PIL lies in:

**Article 32:** Right to Constitutional Remedies
- Supreme Court empowered to issue directions, orders, or writs for enforcement of Fundamental Rights
- Dr. B.R. Ambedkar called it the "heart and soul" of the Constitution

**Article 226:** Power of High Courts
- High Courts can issue writs for enforcement of Fundamental Rights and other legal rights

**Article 39A:** Equal Justice and Free Legal Aid
- State shall secure that operation of legal system promotes justice on basis of equal opportunity
- Provides free legal aid to ensure that opportunities for justice are not denied due to economic or other disabilities

### 1.3 Importance of PIL

PIL has democratized access to justice in India by:
1. Bridging the gap between law and justice
2. Making judiciary accessible to disadvantaged sections
3. Enforcing constitutional rights of marginalized groups
4. Addressing systemic issues affecting large populations
5. Expanding scope of judicial review
6. Ensuring accountability of public authorities

## II. EVOLUTION OF PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION IN INDIA

Before 1980, Indian courts followed the traditional British rule of **locus standi**:

- Limited access to justice for poor and marginalized

### 2.2 Beginning of PIL Movement (1979-1981)

## VIII. CONCLUSION

Public Interest Litigation is one of the most significant innovations in Indian judicial system. It represents the commitment of Indian judiciary to constitutional goals of justice, equality, and dignity. By relaxing technical rules of locus standi and procedure, PIL has democratized access to justice and made the Constitution a living document for all Indians, especially the marginalized and disadvantaged.

The landmark judgments from **S.P. Gupta** to **Common Cause** show the expansive and creative use of PIL for securing Fundamental Rights. Through PIL, the Supreme Court has:
- Expanded Article 21 to include multiple rights
- Developed environmental jurisprudence
- Protected labour rights
- Advanced women's rights
- Reformed criminal justice system
- Ensured government accountability

However, PIL must not degenerate into publicity interest litigation or private interest litigation. Courts must maintain vigilance to ensure that PIL is used genuinely for public interest and not for personal gain, political vendetta, or publicity.

As Dr. Justice A.S. Anand observed:
> "PIL is a strategic arm of legal aid movement intended to bring justice within the reach of the poor masses. But it should not be allowed to degenerate into publicity interest litigation or private interest litigation."

**PIL remains the most powerful tool for achieving constitutional justice for "We, the People of India."**
