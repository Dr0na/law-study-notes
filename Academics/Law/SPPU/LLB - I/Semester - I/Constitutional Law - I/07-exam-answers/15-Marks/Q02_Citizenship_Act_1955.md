**Definition:** A citizen is a person who owes permanent allegiance to a State and is entitled to protection from that State, enjoying full civil and political rights.

### 1.3 Constitutional Provisions

**Mnemonic: BDRNI**
1. **B**irth
2. **D**escent
3. **R**egistration
4. **N**aturalisation
5. **I**ncorporation of territory

---

### METHOD 1: CITIZENSHIP BY BIRTH (Section 3)

**Principle:** *Jus Soli* (Right of soil) - Person born in India is Indian citizen.

#### Before 1986 Amendment

**Any person born in India** on or after 26 January 1950 but before 1 July 1987 was citizen by birth.

**Exceptions:**
1. Father was enemy alien and birth occurred in enemy-occupied territory
2. Father was foreign diplomat and neither parent was Indian citizen

#### After 1986 Amendment (w.e.f. 1 July 1987)

Person born in India between **1 July 1987 and 2 December 2004** is citizen if:
- **At least ONE parent** was Indian citizen at time of birth

#### After 2003 Amendment (w.e.f. 3 December 2004)

Person born in India on or after **3 December 2004** is citizen if:
- **BOTH parents** are Indian citizens, OR
- **One parent is Indian citizen** and **other is not illegal migrant**

**Rationale for Amendments:**
- Prevent automatic citizenship to children of illegal immigrants
- Restrict scope of *jus soli*
- Move towards *jus sanguinis* (citizenship by blood)

**Exceptions (Remain Consistent):**
- Child of foreign diplomat
- Child of enemy alien born in enemy-occupied area

**Example:**
- Child born in Mumbai on 15 August 2023 to Indian mother and Bangladeshi illegal immigrant father → **NOT a citizen**
- Child born in Delhi on 10 January 2025 to Indian father and American mother (legal resident) → **Is a citizen**

---

### METHOD 2: CITIZENSHIP BY DESCENT (Section 4)

**Principle:** *Jus Sanguinis* (Right of blood) - Person born outside India can be citizen if parent is Indian.

#### Provisions

**Person born outside India** on or after 26 January 1950 but before 10 December 1992:
- Citizen if **father** was Indian citizen at time of birth

**Person born outside India** on or after 10 December 1992:
- Citizen if **either parent** was Indian citizen at time of birth

**Gender Neutrality:** After 1992 amendment, mother can also transmit citizenship (earlier only father could).

#### Special Conditions

**If parent was citizen by descent only** (not by birth/registration/naturalisation):
- Birth must be **registered at Indian consulate within one year**
- OR parent was in service of Government of India at time of birth

**Rationale:** To prevent indefinite chain of citizenship by descent across generations without connection to India.

#### Recent Amendments (2015)

For children born outside India on or after 3 December 2004:
- Birth must be registered within one year at Indian consulate
- Parents must submit documents proving Indian citizenship

**Example:**
- Indian citizen working in USA has child there → Child is Indian citizen by descent (provided registration done)
- Person whose grandparents were Indian but born and living abroad → May NOT get citizenship (depends on parent's citizenship type)

---

### METHOD 3: CITIZENSHIP BY REGISTRATION (Section 5)

**Principle:** Certain categories of persons can apply for citizenship through registration.

#### Eligible Categories

**1. Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) - Section 5(1)(a)**

**Before 2003:** Person of Indian origin if he, or either of his parents, or any of grandparents was born in undivided India

**After 2003 Amendment:** Person of Indian origin if he, or either of his parents, or any of grandparents, or great grandparents was:
- Citizen of India by Constitution or Citizenship Act 1955, OR
- Belonged to territory that became part of India after 15 August 1947

**Example:**
- Foreign woman marries Indian citizen and lives in India for 7 years → Can apply for citizenship by registration
- Person of Indian origin from UK moves to India → After 7 years, can register as citizen

---

### METHOD 4: CITIZENSHIP BY NATURALISATION (Section 6)

---

### METHOD 5: CITIZENSHIP BY INCORPORATION OF TERRITORY (Section 7)

**Principle:** When foreign territory becomes part of India, residents may become Indian citizens.

#### Provision

If any territory becomes part of India:
- Central Government may specify date from which persons of that territory become Indian citizens
- May specify conditions, restrictions, or manner of citizenship

#### Historical Examples

**1. Pondicherry (1962):**

- Residents became Indian citizens

**2. Goa, Daman & Diu (1961):**
- Portuguese territory incorporated
- Residents became Indian citizens

**Effect:**
- Ceases to be citizen from date of declaration
- Children also cease to be citizens (unless they register to resume within one year of attaining majority)

**Cannot Renounce:**
- During war (if declaration would be detrimental to sovereignty, integrity, security)

**Example:**

---

### 2. TERMINATION (Section 9) - Automatic

**Citizenship automatically terminates when:**
- Person voluntarily acquires citizenship of another country
- Happens automatically by operation of law

**India does NOT permit dual citizenship.** Acquiring foreign citizenship automatically terminates Indian citizenship.

**Exception:** During war, if Central Government is satisfied that it's necessary for defence, can notify that this section won't apply to acquisition of citizenship of specified country.

**Example:**
Indian citizen takes oath of allegiance to Canada and becomes Canadian citizen → Indian citizenship automatically terminated.

---

### 3. DEPRIVATION (Section 10) - By Government Order

**Central Government can deprive citizenship by order if:**

**A. Acquisition by Fraud:**
- Citizenship obtained by fraud, false representation, or concealment of material fact

**B. Disloyalty:**
- Shown disaffection towards Constitution

**C. Unlawful Activities:**
- Within 5 years of registration/naturalisation, sentenced to imprisonment of 2+ years

**D. Continuous Residence Abroad:**

**E. Other Grounds:**
- Traded or communicated with enemy

**Example:**
Person obtained citizenship by registration based on false documents → Government can deprive citizenship after enquiry and hearing.

## VI. OVERSEAS CITIZENSHIP OF INDIA (OCI) - Sections 7A to 7D

---

## VIII. DUAL CITIZENSHIP - PROHIBITED

### Constitutional Provision

**Article 9:** If person voluntarily acquires citizenship of foreign State, Indian citizenship ceases.

### Rationale

**Why India prohibits dual citizenship:**
1. **Divided Loyalty:** Person cannot owe allegiance to two countries
2. **Sovereignty:** Protecting national sovereignty
3. **Security:** Security concerns
4. **Historical:** Partition experience

### Comparison

**Countries Allowing Dual Citizenship:**
- USA, UK, Canada, Australia (under certain conditions)

**Countries NOT Allowing:**
- India, China, Japan, Singapore

### OCI as Alternative

Since full dual citizenship not permitted:
- **OCI provides middle path**

- No voting rights but economic parity

---

## XI. CONCLUSION

**Citizenship** is the fundamental legal relationship between individual and State, conferring rights and imposing duties. The **Indian Constitution** in Part II (Articles 5-11) and the **Citizenship Act, 1955** provide comprehensive framework for citizenship.

**The Act provides FIVE methods of acquiring citizenship:**
1. **Birth** - Restricted over time to prevent automatic citizenship to children of illegal immigrants
2. **Descent** - Allows transmission by either parent (gender-neutral since 1992)
3. **Registration** - For special categories including spouses, PIOs
4. **Naturalisation** - For foreign nationals after fulfilling stringent conditions
5. **Incorporation** - When territory becomes part of India

**Citizenship can be lost by:**
1. **Renunciation** (voluntary)
2. **Termination** (automatic on acquiring foreign citizenship)
3. **Deprivation** (by Government order for specified reasons)

**India follows SINGLE citizenship** (not dual citizenship like USA), promoting national unity and uniform rights throughout the country. The **OCI scheme** (2003) provides middle path for diaspora, giving benefits without full citizenship.

The citizenship framework balances:
- **Inclusiveness** (allowing acquisition through multiple methods)
- **Security** (preventing illegal immigration and dual loyalty)
- **National Integration** (single citizenship)
- **Diaspora Engagement** (through OCI)

As citizenship determines who enjoys full constitutional rights and owes allegiance to India, the provisions under Citizenship Act, 1955 remain crucial for maintaining India's demographic integrity while accommodating genuine cases of acquisition and loss of citizenship.

**Remember:** **BDRNI** - Birth, Descent, Registration, Naturalisation, Incorporation
