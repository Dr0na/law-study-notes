**Warning:** These contradictions must be resolved quickly, or those suffering will **"blow up the structure of political democracy"**.

---

#### Warning 3: Grammar of Anarchy

> "However good a Constitution may be, if those who are implementing it are not good, it will prove to be bad. However bad a Constitution may be, if those implementing it are good, it will prove to be good."

**Emphasized:**
- Constitution is not everything
- **People must avoid:**

### 🔑 **What is a Constitution?**

**Definition:** 
> A Constitution is the **fundamental law** of a country that establishes:
> - Structure of government
> - Powers of government organs
> - Rights of citizens
> - Relationship between State and citizens

---

### 📚 **Classification of Constitutions**

#### 1. Written vs Unwritten

| Written Constitution | Unwritten Constitution |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Codified in single document | Not in single document |
| Example: India, USA | Example: UK |

**Note:** UK has constitutional documents but not codified.

---

#### 2. Rigid vs Flexible

| Rigid Constitution | Flexible Constitution |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Special procedure for amendment | Same procedure as ordinary law |
| Example: USA | Example: UK |
| **India:** Partly rigid, partly flexible | |

---

#### 3. Federal vs Unitary

| Federal | Unitary |
|---------|---------|
| Division of powers between Centre and States | All powers with Centre |
| Two governments | One government |
| Written Constitution | May be written or unwritten |
| Example: USA, India | Example: UK, France |

---

### ⚖️ **CONSTITUTIONALISM**

#### Definition

> **Constitutionalism** = Limited government under law

**Core Principles:**

```
Constitutionalism
    ├── 1. Rule of Law (not rule by law)
    ├── 2. Limited Government (constitutional restraints)
    ├── 3. Separation of Powers
    ├── 4. Independent Judiciary
    ├── 5. Fundamental Rights Protection
    └── 6. Democratic Accountability
```

---

#### Difference: Constitution vs Constitutionalism

| Constitution | Constitutionalism |
|--------------|------------------|
| Document | Philosophy/Approach |
| Creates structure | Limits power |
| Exists in all countries | Not in all countries |
| Example: USSR had Constitution | Example: USSR lacked constitutionalism |

**Key Point:**
> Having a Constitution ≠ Having Constitutionalism

---

#### Rule of Law

**Three meanings (A.V. Dicey):**

1. **Supremacy of law** over arbitrary power
2. **Equality before law** - no one above law
3. **Rights determined by courts**, not abstract declarations

**In India:**
- Arts. 14, 21 embody Rule of Law
- Judicial review ensures Rule of Law

---

#### Separation of Powers

**Three organs of government:**

```
Government
    ├── Legislature (makes law)
    ├── Executive (implements law)
    └── Judiciary (interprets law)
```

**In India:**
- Not strict separation (parliamentary system)
- Checks and balances exist
- Judicial review by Judiciary
- Parliamentary control over Executive
