## ⚖️ **REASONABLE RESTRICTIONS**

### 🔑 **General Principles**

#### Two-Part Test

**For restriction to be valid:**

```
Reasonable Restriction Test
    ├── 1. PROCEDURAL Reasonableness
    │   ├── Made by competent authority
    │   ├── Proper procedure followed
    │   └── Within legislative competence
    │
    └── 2. SUBSTANTIVE Reasonableness
        ├── Not arbitrary or excessive
        ├── Proportionate to object
        ├── Necessary (not merely convenient)
        └── Fair and just
```

---

#### Burden of Proof

**General Rule:**
- **State must prove** restriction is reasonable
- Burden on State to justify

**Why?**
- Fundamental Right presumed
- Restriction is exception
- Liberty should be protected

---

### 🏛️ **Case: Chintaman Rao v. State of MP, AIR 1951**

**Principle:**
> Restrictions must be **reasonable**, not merely in interest of specified grounds.

**Two requirements:**

---

### Grounds for Restrictions

---

### 🎯 **Doctrine of Proportionality**

**Restriction must be:**
- Not excessive

**Example:** 
- To prevent traffic congestion, total ban on vehicles = disproportionate
- Time restrictions on vehicles = proportionate

---

## 📜 **RIGHT TO PROPERTY - HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE**

### 🔑 **Evolution**

#### Original Position (1950-1978)

**Article 31:**
> No person deprived of property except by authority of law + compensation

---

#### Why Property was Important

- Land reforms
- Nationalization
- Conflict with socialist goals

- Tenancy laws

**Cannot be challenged** on ground of violating Arts. 14, 19, or 31

---

**Currently:** 280+ laws

---

---

### 🏛️ **Case: Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, AIR 1973**

**Held:**
- Property amendments valid
- **BUT:** Cannot destroy **basic structure**

---

### 44th Amendment, 1978

**Drastic Change:**

**DELETED:**
- Article 19(1)(f) - Property as Fundamental Right
- Article 31 - Compulsory acquisition provisions

**ADDED:**
- **Article 300A** - Property as constitutional right

---

### Article 300A - Present Position

**Text:**
> **"No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law."**

---

### New Position - Property Rights

| Aspect | Pre-1978 | Post-1978 |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Status** | Fundamental Right | Constitutional Right |
| **Article** | 19(1)(f), 31 | 300A |
| **Enforceable** | Under Art. 32 | Not under Art. 32 |
| **Compensation** | Required | Not required by Constitution |
| **Procedure** | Reasonable required | Just "authority of law" |
| **Review** | Under Arts. 14, 19, 21, 31 | Only under Arts. 14, 21 |

---

### Implications

**Easier for Government:**
- Land acquisition simpler
- Compensation not constitutional requirement
- Less judicial review

**Weaker for Citizens:**
- Cannot directly approach SC under Art. 32

- Reduced protection

---

### Current Legal Framework

---

## 🔗 **RELATIONSHIP WITH ARTICLES 14 AND 21**

### Interconnection - Maneka Gandhi Case

**Before Maneka Gandhi (1978):**
- Arts. 14, 19, 21 were **mutually exclusive**
- Separate water-tight compartments

**After Maneka Gandhi:**
- **Interconnected**
- Must be read together
- Procedure under Art. 21 must satisfy Art. 19

---

### Implications

**Any restriction on Art. 19 freedoms must:**
1. Satisfy Art. 14 (not arbitrary)
2. Be reasonable, fair, just (Art. 21)
3. Be in interest of grounds specified
4. Pass proportionality test
