## ⚖️ **ARTICLE 14: EQUALITY BEFORE LAW**

### 📜 Text of Article 14

```
Article 14
    ├── 1. Equality Before Law (Negative)
    └── 2. Equal Protection of Laws (Positive)
```

---

### 1️⃣ **EQUALITY BEFORE LAW**

#### Nature: **NEGATIVE CONCEPT**

**Ensures:**
- ✅ No special privilege for anyone
- ✅ All equally subject to ordinary law
- ✅ No person above the law

**Source:** Second corollary of **DICEAN Rule of Law** (Britain)

---

## 📊 **REASONABLE CLASSIFICATION**

### Fundamental Principle

> 🔑 **Art. 14 forbids CLASS LEGISLATION; does NOT forbid REASONABLE CLASSIFICATION**

---

### ✅ **TWO-FOLD TEST FOR VALID CLASSIFICATION**

#### Test 1: Intelligible Differentia

**Classification must be based on:**
- ✅ Real and substantial distinction
- ✅ Intelligible differentia
- ✅ Distinguishes persons/things in class from those outside

**Should NOT be:**

- ❌ Artificial
- ❌ Evasive

#### Test 2: Rational Nexus

**The differentia must have:**
- ✅ Rational/reasonable nexus
- ✅ With object sought to be achieved by statute

---

### ⚖️ **Who Decides Reasonableness?**

> **Courts decide** whether classification is reasonable.

---

## 🎯 **BURDEN OF PROOF**

---

### Definition: 'Backward Class'

**Article 16(4):** "any backward class of citizens"

**Article 15(4):** "socially and educationally backward classes of citizens"

**Both mean the SAME thing.**

---

---

## ♻️ **CARRY FORWARD RULE**

### 🏛️ **Case: T. Devadasan v. Union of India, AIR 1964**

**Facts:**
- 17½% posts reserved for SC/ST annually
- Unfilled reserved posts carried forward for 2 years

| Case | Reservation % | Validity |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Devadasan** | Exceeded 50% | ❌ Invalid |
| **ABSK Sangh** | Up to 66% | ✅ Valid |

#### Rationale for Different Treatment

**Art. 16(2) expressly forbids discrimination on basis of 'caste'.**

**BUT:**
- SC/ST are **not castes** in ordinary meaning
- They are **backward human groups**
- Great divide between them and rest of community
- Suffer from **socio-economic backwardness**

---

## 🔍 **WHAT ARE BACKWARD CLASSES?**

### 🏛️ **Case: K.C. Vasanth Kumar v. State of Karnataka, AIR 1985**

**Five judges wrote five separate opinions:**

| Judge | View on Backwardness |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Chandrachud, C.J.** | Economic backwardness |
| **Desai, J.** | **Only** economic backwardness criterion |
| **Chinnappa Reddy, J.** | Poverty, caste, occupation, habitation |
| **Sen, J.** | **Poverty predominant**; caste for identification only |
| **Venkataramiah, J.** | Stressed **relevance of caste** factor |

**No single clear test emerged.**

---

## 📋 **THE MANDAL COMMISSION CASE**

### 🏛️ **Case: Indra Sawhney v. Union of India, AIR 1993** ⭐

**Most significant pronouncement on reservations.**

---

### Background

| Event | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **1979** | Mandal Commission appointed under Art. 340 |
| **Purpose** | Investigate conditions of socially & educationally backward classes |
| **Finding** | OBCs constitute ~52% population |
| **Recommendation** | **27% government jobs** reserved for OBCs (total 50% with SC/ST) |
| **1982, 1983** | Report discussed in Parliament |
| **Aug 13, 1990** | V.P. Singh Govt accepted recommendation via office memorandum |
| **Result** | Widespread disturbances |
| **1991** | Narasimha Rao Govt modified: (1) Total not to exceed 50% (2) Preference to poorer within OBC quota |

---

### Caste Factor After Indra Sawhney

> 🔑 **Caste can be ONE factor, but NOT SOLE factor to assess backwardness.**

---

## 🥛 **CREAMY LAYER**

### Principle from Mandal Case

> ⚖️ **"Socially advanced members of backward class - the 'creamy layer' - must be EXCLUDED."**

**Benefit of reservation under Art. 16(4) only to the "class" after exclusion of creamy layer.**

### Rationale

Would more appropriately serve purpose and object of Art. 16(4).

---

## 🚫 **ARTICLE 17: ABOLITION OF UNTOUCHABILITY**

### Text

> **"Untouchability" is abolished and its practice in any form is forbidden. The enforcement of any disability arising out of "untouchability" shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law.**
