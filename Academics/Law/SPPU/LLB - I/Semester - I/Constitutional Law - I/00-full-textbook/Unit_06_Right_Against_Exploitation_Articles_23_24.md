```
Article 23(1) Prohibits
    ├── 1. Traffic in Human Beings
    ├── 2. Begar
    └── 3. Other Similar Forms of Forced Labour
```

---

### 1️⃣ **TRAFFIC IN HUMAN BEINGS**

#### Definition

> **'Traffic in human beings'** = Commonly known as **SLAVERY**

**Meaning:**
- Buying and selling of human beings as chattels
- Treating humans like property

#### Scope

**Constitutional Position:**
> 🔴 Such practice is **constitutionally abolished**.

---

### 2️⃣ **BEGAR**

#### Definition

> **'Begar'** means **compulsory work without any payment**.

#### Principle

**Any work without wages = Begar**

**Constitutional guarantee:**
> ⚖️ **"It is a Fundamental Right of a citizen not to be compelled to work without wages."**

---

#### Case Illustration

**Withholding pay of government employee** as punishment held **invalid** under Art. 23.

**Reasoning:**
> "To ask a man to work and then not to pay him any salary or wages savours of begar."

---

### 3️⃣ **FORCED LABOUR**

#### What is NOT Forced Labour

| Activity | Forced Labour? |
|----------|----------------|
| **Conscription for police service** | ❌ No |
| **Military service** | ❌ No |

**Reason:** Cannot come under either traffic or begar.

---

#### Civil Servant Under Suspension

**Example:** Punjab rule - civil servant under suspension for misconduct won't retire until enquiry concluded.

**Challenge:** Violates Art. 23 (forced labour)

**Held:** ❌ **Not forced labour**
- Servant on suspension does **no work**
- Cannot be equated to begar or forced labour

---

#### Teachers' Duties

**Government demanding services of teachers** for:
- Census
- Election
- Family planning duties

**Held:** ✅ **NOT violative** of Art. 23(1)

---

## 📈 **EXPANSIVE INTERPRETATION - POST 1982**

### Revolutionary Change

**SC gave expansive significance** to "forced labour" beginning with **Asiad case in 1982**.

---

### New Principle

> 🔑 **"Every form of forced labour is within inhibition of Art. 23."**

**Makes no difference whether:**
- Person is remunerated or not
- Person forced to give labour/service

---

### Payment of Wages

> ⚠️ **Even payment of wages LESS than minimum wages regarded as FORCED LABOUR.**

---

### 🏛️ **Case: Sanjit Roy v. State of Rajasthan**

**Facts:** State paying wages **lower than minimum wages** to persons on famine relief work.

**Held:** ❌ **Invalid under Art. 23**

---

### Equal Remuneration Act, 1976

**Non-observance** by government contractors raises questions under **Art. 14**.

**Note:** Act enacted in pursuance of **Art. 39** (Directive Principle).

---

### 🏛️ **Case: Labourers Working on Salal Hydro-Project v. State of J&K**

**Facts:** Workmen employed on project denied rights and benefits under various labour laws.

**Violations found:**
- Inter-State Migrant Workmen Act, 1979 - **not implemented at all**
- Minimum Wages Act - **violations**

**Directions:**
- ✅ Central Government to identify inter-State workers
- ✅ Ensure benefits of Inter-State Migrant Workmen Act

---

## ⚖️ **HARD LABOUR BY PRISONERS**

### Kerala High Court Ruling

**Prisoners entitled to payment of reasonable wages** for work taken from them.

**Rationale:**
> Right not to be exploited in contravention of Art. 23(1) is right guaranteed to citizen.

---

## ⛓️ **BONDED LABOUR**

### The Bonded System

**Description:**
- One person bonded to provide labour to another
- For years and years
- Until debt supposed to be wiped out

**Purpose of system:**
> Enable few socially and economically powerful persons to **exploit weaker sections**.

---

### Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976

**Enacted:** To give effect to Art. 23

**Purpose:** Abolish bonded labour system

---

### Implementation Problems

**Despite constitutional and legal provisions:**
- ⚠️ Implementation **very tardy** at administrative level
- Vested interests make themselves felt

**Difficult problems:**
1. **Identifying** bonded labour
2. **Rehabilitation** after release from bondage

---

### 🏛️ **Case: Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India**

**Nature:** Public Interest Litigation by organisation dedicated to release of bonded labourers.

**Significance:**
> **Court linked Arts. 23 and 21** in context of bonded labour.

**Impact:** Several judicial pronouncements on slow implementation.

---

### 🏛️ **Case: Neeraja Choudhary v. State of MP**

**Emphasis:**
- ✅ Release of bonded labourers
- ✅ **Proper rehabilitation** (stressed)

> 📌 Release alone not enough - rehabilitation essential.

---

## 👩 **PROSTITUTES AND TRAFFICKING**

### Constitutional Prohibition

**Expression "traffic in human beings":**

**Now:** Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956

---

#### Objectives

| **Opportunity** | For fallen victims to become decent members of society |
| **Public Purpose** | Achieving above goals |

---

### 🏛️ **Case: Vishal Jeet v. Union of India**

**Directive:**
> SC directed State Governments to instruct **law enforcing authorities** to take action to **eradicate child prostitution**.

> **"No child below the age of fourteen years shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any other hazardous employment."**

---

### 🔑 **KEY FEATURES**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Age Limit** | Below 14 years |
| **Prohibition** | Factory, Mine, Hazardous employment |
| **Scope** | Partial restriction (not total ban) |
| **Rationale** | Total ban not socially feasible in current socio-economic environment |

---

### Three Prohibited Employments

```
Article 24 Prohibits Child Labour In
    ├── 1. Factory
    ├── 2. Mine
    └── 3. Any Other Hazardous Employment
```

---

## ⚖️ **ENFORCEMENT AGAINST ALL**

### 🏛️ **Case: Asiad**

**SC emphasized:**
> Art. 24 embodies Fundamental Right **"plainly and indubitably enforceable against everyone."**

**By reason of compulsive mandate:**
> 🔴 **NO ONE can employ child below 14 years** in hazardous employment like construction work.

---

### 🏛️ **Case: Labourers Working on Salal Hydro-Project v. State of J&K**

**Reiterated:** Construction work is **hazardous employment**.

**Therefore:** Children below 14 **cannot be employed** on any such work.

**Constitutional prohibition:** Art. 24

---

#### Court Directions

**SC directed Central Government:**
- ✅ Enforce this prohibition
- ✅ Persuade workmen to send children to school
- ✅ Provide free education

---

### Socio-Economic Reality

> **Court realizes:** In prevailing socio-economic development, **complete prohibition of child labour** would not be acceptable to large masses because of **poverty**.

---

## 📋 **PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION ON CHILD LABOUR**

**Question of employment of child labour** brought to SC attention in several cases by way of **PIL**.

---

### 🏛️ **Case: M.C. Mehta v. State of Tamil Nadu**
