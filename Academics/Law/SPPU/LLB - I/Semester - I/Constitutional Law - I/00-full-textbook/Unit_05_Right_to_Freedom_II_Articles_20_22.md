---

## 📚 **EVOLUTION OF INTERPRETATION**

### Stage 1: A.K. Gopalan Era (1950-1978)

#### 🏛️ **Case: A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras, AIR 1950**

**Narrow Interpretation:**

| Aspect | Gopalan View |
|--------|--------------|
| **Personal Liberty** | Limited to freedom from physical restraint |
| **Scope** | Only punitive & preventive detention |
| **Relationship** | Arts. 19, 21, 22 mutually exclusive |
| **Due Process** | ❌ Rejected - word 'due' absent |
| **Natural Justice** | Not required in law |

#### Two Major Principles from Gopalan

**Principle 1:**
> Arts. 19, 21, 22 are **mutually exclusive and independent**. Art. 19 not applicable to law affecting personal liberty (Art. 21 applies).

**Principle 2:**
> Law affecting life/personal liberty cannot be unconstitutional merely for lack of natural justice/due procedure. Legislature free to lay down any procedure.

---

### Stage 2: Softening of Rigid View (1970-1978)

#### 🏛️ **Bank Nationalization Case (1970)**

Beginning of new trend:
- Art. 19(1)(f) applied to law enacted under Art. 31(2)

#### 🏛️ **Bennett Coleman Case**

- Law affecting freedom of speech assessable under Art. 19(2)
- Even if not enacted directly to control speech

#### 🏛️ **P.L. Lakhanpal v. Union of India**

- Review of detention is **quasi-judicial function**
- Right of representation should be given
- Court can impose natural justice by interpretation

> 📌 **Significant:** While lack of natural justice in law would not invalidate it, Court could still impose natural justice interpretatively.

---

### Stage 3: Maneka Gandhi Revolution (1978 onwards)

#### 🏛️ **Case: Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, AIR 1978** ⭐

> **LANDMARK CASE - Practically overruled Gopalan**

**The New Approach:**

| Aspect | Maneka Gandhi View |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Personal Liberty** | Broad interpretation |
| **Relationship** | Arts. 14, 19, 21 **NOT mutually exclusive** |
| **Due Process** | **Introduced** - procedure must be reasonable, fair, just |
| **Review** | Law itself can be declared unconstitutional |
| **Natural Justice** | Integral part of Art. 21 |

---

#### 🔑 **KEY PRINCIPLES FROM MANEKA GANDHI**

##### Principle 1: Interconnection of Articles

> ⚖️ **Arts. 14, 19 and 21 are NOT mutually exclusive.** 
> 
> Nexus established between these three Articles.

##### Principle 2: Higher Standard

> Law prescribing procedure for depriving personal liberty must meet requirements of **Art. 19**.

##### Principle 3: Dual Compliance

> Procedure established by law in Art. 21 must answer requirement of **Art. 14** as well.

##### Principle 4: Judicial Review

> Court may declare **law itself unconstitutional** by reading Art. 21 with Arts. 14 and 19.

##### Principle 5: Anti-Arbitrariness

> Art. 14 outlaws **unreasonableness and arbitrariness**.

#### Final Principle

> 💡 **"The attempt of the court should be to expand the reach and ambit of fundamental rights rather than to attenuate their meaning."**

---

## 🔍 **DUE PROCESS OF LAW**

### U.S. Constitutional Concept

**V Amendment (USA):**
> "No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property, **without due process of law**"

**Under 'due process':**
- Courts become arbiter of reasonableness
- Both **substantive** and **procedural** provisions examined

---

### Indian Position

#### Gopalan's Rejection of Due Process

**Reasons for rejection:**

| # | Reason |
|---|--------|
| 1 | Word **'due' absent** in Art. 21 - significant omission |
| 2 | **Drafting history** - 'due process' words deliberately dropped |
| 3 | **Complexity concerns** - importing doctrine would make things complicated |

---

#### Maneka Gandhi's Introduction of Due Process

> ✅ **Post-Maneka: "Procedure" for Art. 21 must be reasonable, fair and just.**

**This is introduction of due process through back door.**

---

## 📝 **WHAT IS "LAW" UNDER ARTICLE 21?**

**"Law" includes:**

| Type | Included? |
|------|-----------|
| **Acts of Legislature** | ✅ Yes |
| **Ordinances** | ✅ Yes |
| **Rules by Supreme Court** | ✅ Yes |
| **Rules by High Court** | ✅ Yes (under Art. 225) |

---

## ⚖️ **"PROCEDURE" UNDER ARTICLE 21**

### Post-Maneka Standard

> **Procedure must be:**
> - ✅ Reasonable
> - ✅ Fair
> - ✅ Just

**Example:** Procedure of imprisoning poor person for debt failure violative of Art. 21:
> "Unless there is proof of wilful failure to pay despite sufficient means."

---

## 🎯 **ONUS OF PROOF**

### Distinction

| Articles | Burden of Proof |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Art. 14** | On challenger (initial presumption of validity) |
| **Arts. 19 & 21** | Once right shown infringed, **burden on State** to justify |

### For Articles 19 and 21

**Once petitioner shows right taken away:**

State must justify by showing:
- ✅ Restriction is reasonable (Art. 19), **OR**
- ✅ Procedure is just, fair, reasonable (Art. 21)

---

## ⚖️ **CRIMINAL JUSTICE AFTER MANEKA GANDHI**

### Impact of Maneka Gandhi

> 💡 **"Thanks to Art. 21, human rights jurisprudence in India has constitutional status and sweep."**

---

### Maximum Imprisonment Period
