### Two-Fold Test: **"I-R"**

| Test | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **I** - Intelligible Differentia | Real & substantial distinction |

### Burden of Proof

**On challenger** - but shifts to State if discrimination obvious (Dalmia v. Tendolkar)

| **Single Entity** | Charanjit Lal | One company can be class |
| **Disaster-Specific** | Charan Lal Sahu | Bhopal Gas Act valid |

## 🚨 **ARBITRARINESS & ARTICLE 14**
