## 🧠 MASTER STRUCTURED NOTES

### 1. Development and Nature of Muslim Law

**📜 Historical Development**
- **Pre-British**: Mughal Emperors (Hanafis) administered Hanafi law
- **British Rule**: Applied as personal law according to school
- **Modern**: Shariat Act, 1937 made it uniform

**👤 Who is a Muslim?**
- Professes: "La ilahi ill lil lah Mohammad ur Rasul Allah"
- Belief in unity of God + mission of Muhammad
- **Sufficient**: Profession alone (no rites required)

**👥 Application**
- **Personal law** (not territorial)
- Applies only to **Muslims** (by birth or conversion)
- **Matters**: Marriage, Divorce, Dower, Inheritance, Wakf, etc.

**📜 Shariat Application Act, 1937**

**Section 2 (Mandatory - Coercive)**
- Applies to: Intestate succession, Marriage, Divorce, Maintenance, Dower, Guardianship, Gift, Wakf
- **Abrogates custom** in favor of Shariat
- **Excluded**: Agricultural land, Pre-emption

**Section 3 (Optional - Persuasive)**
- Declaration by competent Muslim
- Applies to: Adoption, Wills, Legacies
- Effect: Applies to declarant + minor children + descendants

**Key Differences: Section 2 vs Section 3**

| Aspect | Section 2 | Section 3 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Nature** | Coercive (mandatory) | Persuasive (optional) |
| **Purpose** | Abrogate customs | Provide option to abandon customs |
| **Effect on Customs** | Invalidates customs | Does not invalidate, only provides option |
| **Appeal** | Not applicable | Available if authority refuses |

**Important Case Laws:**
- **Noor Jahan v. E Tiscenko (AIR 1941 Cal 582)**: Shariat Act applies only if **both parties are Muslims**
- **Ashraf Ali v. Mohammed Ali (AIR 1947 Bom 122)**: Testamentary trusts covered by Section 2

**🔄 Effect of Conversion**

**From Islam (Apostasy)**:
- **Succession**: Freedom of Religion Act, 1850 - convert does NOT lose inheritance
- **Marriage**: 
  - Husband's conversion = dissolved **ipso facto**
  - Wife's conversion = depends (born Muslim vs converted)

**To Islam**:
- Renounces former religion
- Substitutes Muslim law
- **Condition**: Must be **bonafide** (not colorable)

## 🧠 MNEMONICS

**Sources Hierarchy**: **Q**uran **S**unna **I**jma'a **Q**uiyas = **QSIQ**

**Sunni Schools**: **H**anafi **M**aliki **S**haffie **H**anbali = **HMSH** (Hindu-Muslim-Shia-Hindu)

**Shia Schools**: **I**thana Ashari **I**smailis **Z**aiday = **IIZ**

**Ijma'a**: **C**onsensus **C**annot be **R**epealed = **CCR**

**Shariat Act**: **S**ection **2** = **C**oercive, **S**ection **3** = **P**ersuasive = **2C3P**

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES STUDENTS MAKE

1. ❌ Assuming all Muslims are Hanafi (presumption can be rebutted)
2. ❌ Thinking Ijma'a can be repealed (it cannot)
3. ❌ Confusing Quiyas as source (it's principle of interpretation)
4. ❌ Forgetting that Shariat Act Section 2 applies only if both parties are Muslims
5. ❌ Not understanding difference between Section 2 (mandatory) and Section 3 (optional)
6. ❌ Mixing up Sunni and Shia schools
7. ❌ Forgetting that Ahmadiya is NOT recognized as Muslim
