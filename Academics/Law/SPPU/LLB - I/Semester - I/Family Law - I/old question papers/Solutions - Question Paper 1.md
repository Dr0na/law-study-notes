### Q2. "A Hindu Marriage is a sacrament but a Muslim Marriage is essentially contract." Comment on this statement highlighting the essential of both marriages. (15 marks)

**MODEL ANSWER:**

**Introduction (2 marks)**
The statement reflects the traditional understanding of marriage in Hindu and Muslim law. While Hindu marriage has been viewed as a sacrament, Muslim marriage is essentially a civil contract. However, modern legal developments show that Hindu marriage also has contractual elements, and both systems have evolved.

---

**Main Body (10 marks)**

**PART I: HINDU MARRIAGE - SACRAMENT AND CONTRACT**

**Hindu Marriage as Sacrament:**
- Last of **10 sacraments (Samskara)** in Hindu religion
- Performed to purify body from inherited taint
- **Religious necessity** - not just social contract
- **Indissoluble union** - "union of flesh with flesh and bone with bone"
- Wife = **Ardhangini** (half body of husband)
- Shares fruits of all acts (good or bad) - concept of spiritual unity
- **Case**: Purshottamadas v. Purshottamadas - recognized sacramental nature

**Hindu Marriage as Contract:**
- **Kanyadan** fulfills requirements of gift (as per Manu)
- Concept continues even after HMA 1955
- Parties enter into marriage by **consent**
- Can be **dissolved by mutual consent** (Section 13-B)
- Breakdown theory recognizes contractual nature
- **Case**: Bhagwati Saran Singh v. Parmeshwari - recognized both aspects

**✅ Legal Position**: **BOTH sacrament AND contract**

**Essentials of Valid Hindu Marriage (Section 5, HMA 1955):**

1. **Both parties must be Hindus** (Section 5)
2. **Bigamy (Monogamy)** - Section 5(i): Neither party has spouse living
3. **Mental capacity** - Section 5(ii): Not incapable of valid consent
4. **Age** - Section 5(iii): Male 21, Female 18
5. **Prohibited relationship** - Section 5(iv): Not within prohibited degrees
6. **Sapinda relationship** - Section 5(v): Not sapindas (3 gen maternal, 5 gen paternal)
7. **Ceremonies** - Section 7: Customary rites (Saptapadi essential)
8. **Registration** - Section 8: Optional but recommended

**Additional Features:**
- **Void marriages** (Section 11): Bigamy, Prohibited, Sapinda
- **Voidable marriages** (Section 12): Impotency, Mental, Consent, Pregnancy

---

**PART II: MUSLIM MARRIAGE - ESSENTIALLY CONTRACT**

**Muslim Marriage as Contract:**
- **Not a sacrament** (unlike Hindu marriage)
- **Civil contract** between man and woman
- **Ibadat** (devotional act) - but still contractual
- **Sunnat** (practice of Prophet)
- **Wajib** (obligatory) for physically fit Muslims
- Can be **dissolved** by talaq (husband) or through court (wife)
- **Polygamy allowed** (up to 4 wives) - contractual right

**Essentials of Valid Muslim Marriage (Nikah):**

1. **Proposal and Acceptance (Ijab and Qubul)**
   - Both at **one meeting** (essential)
   - Two male OR one male + two female witnesses
   - Witnesses must be sane, adult Muslims
   - Usual form: "I have married myself to you" / "I have consented"

2. **Capacity to Contract**
   - Sound mind + Puberty
   - **Puberty = Majority** (for marriage matters)
   - Indian Majority Act, 1875: Does NOT apply to marriage, dower, divorce
   - Hanafi: Presumed at 15 years
   - **Case**: Shafin Jahan v. Asokan K.M. (2018) - 16-year-old Muslim girl's marriage held valid

3. **Guardianship (Jabar)**
   - **Sunni Order**: Father → Paternal Grandfather → Brother → Mother → Others
   - **Shia**: Only Father + Paternal Grandfather
   - **Option of Puberty**: Minor can ratify/repudiate on attaining puberty

4. **Absence of Impediments**
   - **Absolute (Batil - Void)**: Polyandry, Consanguinity, Affinity, Fosterage
   - **Relative (Fasid - Invalid)**: 5th wife, No witnesses, Religion, Conjunction, Iddat

5. **Formalities**
   - No prescribed ceremonies
   - Customary practices (not essential): Nikah by Kazi, Exchange of gifts, Prayers
   - Registration NOT compulsory

**Key Differences from Hindu Marriage:**
- No mandatory ceremonies (unlike Saptapadi in Hindu law)
- Polygamy allowed (Hindu law prohibits)
- Easier dissolution (talaq vs court decree)
- Dower (mahr) is essential consideration

---

**Comparison Table:**

| Aspect | Hindu Marriage | Muslim Marriage |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Nature** | Sacrament + Contract | Civil Contract + Ibadat |
| **Ceremonies** | Mandatory (Saptapadi) | Not essential |
| **Registration** | Optional (recommended) | Not compulsory |
| **Polygamy** | Prohibited | Allowed (4 wives) |
| **Divorce** | By court decree | Talaq (husband's right) |
| **Witnesses** | Not required | Required (2 male or 1 male + 2 female) |
| **Dissolution** | Mutual consent or fault grounds | Talaq, Khula, Mubarat, Court decree |

---

**Conclusion (3 marks)**
The statement is largely accurate but requires qualification. Hindu marriage is indeed sacramental in nature, but modern law recognizes contractual elements, especially in dissolution. Muslim marriage is essentially a contract, though it has religious significance as Ibadat. Both systems have evolved, with Hindu law incorporating contractual elements and Muslim law maintaining its contractual foundation while recognizing religious aspects. The essentials reflect these differences - Hindu law emphasizes ceremonies and sacramental nature, while Muslim law emphasizes contractual elements and formalities.

### Q10(b). Sneha and Lata are two Hindu sisters. Sneha has two sons. Lata is childless. Sneha with the consent of her husband, gave one of her sons in adoption to Lata. The husband changed his mind and demanded the custody of child back from Lata. Advise him. (5 marks)

**ANSWER:**

**Legal Analysis:**

**Relevant Law**: Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956

**Section 9: Persons Capable of Giving in Adoption**

**Priority:**
1. **Father** (if alive, has exclusive right with mother's consent)
2. **Mother** (if father dead/renounced/ceased to be Hindu/declared unsound)
3. **Guardian** (if both parents absent)

**Section 9(2): Father's Right**
- Father, if alive, shall **alone** have the right
- **Cannot exercise** without mother's consent (unless exceptions)

**Section 9(3): Mother's Right**
- Mother may give child in adoption if father is:
  - Dead, OR
  - Has completely and finally renounced the world, OR
  - Has ceased to be Hindu, OR
  - Has been declared by court to be of unsound mind

**Section 15: Valid Adoption Not to Be Cancelled**
- **No adoption** which has been **validly made** can be:
  - Cancelled by adoptive father or mother, OR
  - Cancelled by any other person
- **Adopted child cannot**:
  - Renounce status as adopted child, OR
  - Return to family of birth

**Analysis of Facts:**
- Sneha (mother) gave child in adoption
- Husband (father) **consented** to adoption
- Adoption was **valid** (both parents consented)
- Husband now wants to revoke

**Answer: Husband CANNOT get custody back**

**Reasoning:**
1. ✅ Adoption was **validly made** with husband's consent
2. ✅ **Section 15** provides that valid adoption **cannot be cancelled**
3. ✅ Once valid, adoption is **irrevocable and permanent**
4. ✅ Husband cannot revoke his consent after adoption is complete
5. ✅ Child is now **lawful child** of Lata (adoptive mother)
6. ✅ All ties with birth family (including father) are **severed**

**Advice to Husband:**
- **Cannot** get custody back
- Adoption is **permanent and irrevocable**
- Child's legal relationship is now with Lata
- Husband has **no legal right** to demand return of child
- If he wants to challenge, he must prove adoption was **invalid** (e.g., fraud, coercion, or non-compliance with Section 11 conditions)

**Conclusion:**
The husband cannot get custody back. Once a valid adoption is completed with his consent, it becomes irrevocable under Section 15 of HAMA, 1956. The child is now Lata's lawful child, and all ties with the birth family are severed.

### Q10(d). Azar and Taslima both Muslim married under Muslim Law. Now Azar wants to marry Taslima's younger sister Aayat. Can he do so? (5 marks)

**ANSWER:**

**Legal Analysis:**

**Relevant Law**: Muslim Law - Impediments to Marriage

**Impediments to Marriage:**

**Absolute Impediments (Batil - Void):**
1. Polyandry
2. Consanguinity (blood relationship)
3. Affinity (relationship by marriage)
4. Fosterage

**Relative Impediments (Fasid - Invalid):**
1. Fifth wife
2. Absence of witnesses
3. Difference of religion
4. **Unlawful conjunction** (two wives related)
5. Woman in iddat

**Unlawful Conjunction:**
- **Prohibition**: Cannot have two wives who are **related** to each other
- **Examples**: Sisters, aunt and niece, etc.
- **Reason**: To avoid family conflicts
- **Remedy**: Divorce one OR death of either

**Analysis of Facts:**
- Azar married to **Taslima**
- Wants to marry **Aayat** (Taslima's younger sister)
- **Relationship**: Sisters (related by blood)

**Answer: NO, Azar CANNOT marry Aayat**

**Reasoning:**
1. ❌ **Unlawful conjunction** - Cannot have two wives who are sisters
2. ❌ This is a **relative impediment (Fasid - Invalid)**
3. ❌ Marriage would be **invalid** if attempted
4. ✅ **Remedy**: Azar must **divorce Taslima** first, OR wait for her death
5. ✅ After divorce/death, he can marry Aayat

**Legal Position:**
- **Sunni Law**: Unlawful conjunction makes marriage **invalid (Fasid)**
- **Shia Law**: Similar prohibition
- **Exception**: If first wife dies or is divorced, then can marry sister

**If Azar Proceeds:**
- Marriage would be **invalid (Fasid)**
- **Remedy**: Divorce one wife to make it valid
- **Children**: Would be legitimate (unlike Batil marriages)
- **Dower**: Proper or specified (whichever less)

**Conclusion:**
Azar **cannot** marry Aayat while Taslima is still his wife, as it would constitute unlawful conjunction (having two wives who are sisters). This is a relative impediment making the marriage invalid. Azar must either divorce Taslima or wait for her death before marrying Aayat.
