### Q1. (b) Is Hindu Law 'lex loci'?— Explain. (4 marks)

**Answer:**

**Synopsis:**
- Meaning of lex loci
- Hindu Law as personal law
- Not territorial law
- Application based on personal status
- Conclusion

---

**Definition/Meaning:**

**Lex Loci**: Law of the place/territory - applies to all persons within a territory regardless of personal status.

**Personal Law**: Applies based on person's religion, community, or personal status, not territory.

---

**Relevant Provisions:**

- Hindu Law is **personal law**, not lex loci
- Applies to Hindus wherever they are
- Not based on territory

---

Hindu Law is **NOT lex loci**. It is **personal law**.

**Reasons:**

1. **Applies Based on Personal Status**
   - Applies to Hindus by religion or birth
   - Not based on territory or place
   - Hindu in India = Hindu in foreign country (for personal matters)

2. **Not Territorial**
   - Does not apply to all persons in India
   - Only applies to Hindus
   - Non-Hindus in India not governed by Hindu Law

3. **Personal Matters**
   - Marriage, Divorce, Succession, Adoption
   - Governed by personal law
   - Not by law of territory

4. **Exception**
   - Scheduled Tribes excluded (customary law applies)
   - Shows it's personal, not territorial

**Comparison:**
- **Lex Loci**: Indian Penal Code (applies to all in India)
- **Personal Law**: Hindu Law (applies only to Hindus)

---

**Conclusion:**

Hindu Law is personal law, not lex loci. It applies based on personal status (being Hindu) rather than territory. A Hindu is governed by Hindu Law wherever they are, while a non-Hindu in India is not governed by Hindu Law. This distinguishes it from territorial laws that apply to all persons within a territory.

### Q1. (c) Whether the child will be Hindu in the following cases?— Give reasons for your answer. (2×3 = 6 marks)

**Answer:**

**Synopsis:**
- Section 2(1)(b): Hindus by birth
- Case (i): Sikh father and Hindu mother
- Case (ii): Hindu mother and Muslim father
- Case (iii): Hindu parents, mother converts later
- Analysis of each case
- Conclusion

---

**Definition/Meaning:**

**Hindu by Birth (Section 2(1)(b))**: Child of Hindu parents OR child of one Hindu parent + brought up as Hindu.

---

**Relevant Provisions of the Act:**

- **Section 2(1)(b)**: Hindus by birth
- **Section 2(1)(a)**: Hindus by religion (includes Sikhs)

---

**(i) A child is born of a Sikh father and Hindu mother.**

**Answer: YES, child will be Hindu**

**Reasoning:**
- **Section 2(1)(a)**: Sikhs are included in definition of Hindu
- Both parents are "Hindus" under the Act (Sikh = Hindu for purposes of Act)
- **Section 2(1)(b)**: Child of Hindu parents = Hindu by birth
- Child is Hindu by birth

---

**(ii) A child is born of Hindu mother and Muslim father.**

**Answer: DEPENDS on how child is brought up**

**Reasoning:**
- Father is Muslim (not Hindu)
- Mother is Hindu
- **Section 2(1)(b)**: Child of one Hindu parent + **brought up as Hindu** = Hindu
- If child brought up as Hindu → **YES, child will be Hindu**
- If child brought up as Muslim → **NO, child will be Muslim**
- **Key factor**: How child is brought up

---

**(iii) A child is born of Hindu parents. The child is brought up as Hindu. Subsequently mother converts to Islam.**

**Answer: YES, child will be Hindu**

**Reasoning:**
- Child born of Hindu parents (both Hindu at time of birth)
- Child brought up as Hindu
- **Section 2(1)(b)**: Child of Hindu parents = Hindu by birth
- Mother's subsequent conversion does **NOT affect** child's status
- Status determined at birth and upbringing, not by parent's later conversion
- Child remains Hindu

---

**Conclusion:**

The status of child as Hindu depends on parent's status at time of birth and how child is brought up. In case (i), child is Hindu as both parents are "Hindus" under the Act. In case (ii), child's status depends on upbringing. In case (iii), child remains Hindu despite mother's later conversion, as status is determined at birth.

---

Hindu marriage is **BOTH sacrament AND contract**.

**Hindu Marriage as Sacrament:**
- Last of **10 sacraments (Samskara)**
- Performed to purify body from inherited taint
- **Religious necessity** - not just social contract
- **Indissoluble union** - "union of flesh with flesh and bone with bone"
- Wife = **Ardhangini** (half body of husband)
- Shares fruits of all acts (good or bad) - concept of spiritual unity
- **Case**: Purshottamadas v. Purshottamadas - recognized sacramental nature

**Hindu Marriage as Contract:**
- **Kanyadan** fulfills requirements of gift (as per Manu)
- Concept continues even after HMA 1955
- Parties enter into marriage by **consent**
- Can be **dissolved by mutual consent** (Section 13-B)
- Breakdown theory recognizes contractual nature (Section 13(1-A))
- **Case**: Bhagwati Saran Singh v. Parmeshwari - recognized both aspects

**Legal Position:**
- **BOTH sacrament AND contract**
- Sacramental: Ceremonies, religious significance, spiritual unity
- Contractual: Consent, dissolution, mutual agreement

**Modern Developments:**
- HMA 1955 recognizes both aspects
- Divorce provisions show contractual element
- Religious ceremonies show sacramental nature
- Breakdown theory balances both

---

**Case Laws:**

- **Purshottamadas v. Purshottamadas**: Recognized sacramental nature of Hindu marriage
- **Bhagwati Saran Singh v. Parmeshwari Nandan Singh**: Recognized both sacramental and contractual aspects

---

**Conclusion:**

Hindu marriage uniquely combines sacramental and contractual elements. While it retains its religious sanctity as a sacrament, modern law recognizes contractual aspects, especially in dissolution through mutual consent and breakdown theory. The Act balances both aspects, maintaining traditional values while providing modern remedies. The statement that it is "a sacrament but a contract" is accurate - it is both, not either/or.

### Q7. (b) Solve the following problems (any four): (3×4 = 12 marks)

#### (i) 'M', a male Hindu has three wives namely, 'F1', F2' and F3'. 'M' adopts a son with the consent of 'F1' and 'F3'. But, 'F2' does not give her consent. Is the adoption valid?

**Answer:**

**Synopsis:**
- Section 7: Consent of all wives required
- Multiple wives: Consent of all necessary
- Analysis of facts
- Legal position
- Conclusion

---

**Relevant Provisions of the Act:**

- **Section 7**: Capacity of a male Hindu to take in adoption
- Requires wife's consent
- If multiple wives: Consent of all wives necessary

---

**Legal Analysis:**

**Section 7: Multiple Wives**
- If person has more than one wife living
- **Consent of all wives** necessary
- Unless consent of any one is unnecessary for reasons specified

**Analysis of Facts:**
- M has three wives: F1, F2, F3
- Consent obtained from F1 and F3
- **F2 does NOT give consent**
- Adoption attempted without F2's consent

**Answer: NO, adoption is NOT valid**

**Reasoning:**
1. ❌ **Section 7** requires consent of **all wives** when person has multiple wives
2. ❌ F2's consent is **missing**
3. ❌ Adoption made without consent of all wives = **INVALID**
4. ✅ **Exception**: If F2's consent is unnecessary (e.g., she has renounced world, ceased to be Hindu, declared unsound), then adoption may be valid
5. ❌ But facts do not indicate any exception

---

**Conclusion:**

The adoption is **NOT valid** because consent of all three wives is required under Section 7, and F2's consent is missing. Unless F2's consent is unnecessary due to exceptions (renounced world, ceased to be Hindu, declared unsound), the adoption cannot be valid.

---

#### (ii) 'M', a male Hindu aged about 35 years wants to adopt a girl child of 15 years. Can 'M' take the child in adoption?

**Answer:**

**Synopsis:**
- Section 11: Age difference requirement
- Male adopting female: 21 years older

---

**Relevant Provisions of the Act:**

- Age difference: Male adopting female must be at least 21 years older

---

**Legal Analysis:**

**Section 11: Age Difference**
- If male adopting female: Adoptive father must be **at least 21 years older**

**Analysis of Facts:**
- M's age: 35 years
- Girl's age: 15 years
- **Age difference**: 35 - 15 = **20 years**
- **Required**: At least 21 years

**Answer: NO, M cannot adopt**

**Reasoning:**
1. ❌ **Section 11** requires adoptive father to be **at least 21 years older** than female child
2. ❌ Age difference is **20 years** (less than required 21 years)
3. ❌ Adoption would violate Section 11 condition
4. ✅ **Remedy**: M must wait until age difference is at least 21 years, OR adopt child younger than 14 years

---

**Conclusion:**

M **cannot** adopt the 15-year-old girl because the age difference (20 years) is less than the required 21 years under Section 11. The adoption would be invalid for non-compliance with age difference requirement.

---

#### (iii) 'F', a female Hindu wants to adopt 'D', a married girl. Can 'F' adopt 'D'?

**Answer: NO, F cannot adopt D (unless custom permits)**

**Reasoning:**
1. ❌ **Section 10** requires person to be **not married** (unless custom permits)
2. ❌ D is married, so condition not fulfilled
3. ✅ **Exception**: If custom/usage permits adoption of married person, then adoption may be valid
4. ❌ But general rule: Married person cannot be adopted

---

**Conclusion:**

F **cannot** adopt D because D is married, and Section 10 prohibits adoption of married persons unless custom/usage permits. The general rule is that only unmarried persons can be adopted.

---

#### (iv) A widow adopts a child and gets married subsequently. What will be the relationship between the child and the father?

---

**Legal Analysis:**

**Analysis of Facts:**
- Widow adopts child (valid - Section 8 allows)

- New husband enters picture

**Answer: Subsequent husband is STEPFATHER**

**Reasoning:**
1. ✅ Widow can adopt (Section 8 - not married/widowed)

**Legal Position:**
- Child's adoptive mother = widow (who adopted)
- Subsequent husband = **stepfather** (not adoptive father)
- Child has no legal relationship with stepfather through adoption
- Stepfather has no rights/obligations as adoptive parent

---

**Conclusion:**

When a widow adopts a child and subsequently marries, the subsequent husband becomes the **stepfather** of the adopted child, not the adoptive father. The child's legal relationship is only with the widow (adoptive mother), and the subsequent husband has no adoptive parent rights or obligations.

---

#### (v) 'M', a male Hindu has three wives namely, 'F1', 'F2' and 'F3'. 'M' adopts a son with the consent of all the wives. What is the relationship between the child and the mother?

**Legal Analysis:**

**Section 14: Adoption with Consent of Multiple Wives**

**Analysis of Facts:**
- M has three wives: F1, F2, F3
- All three consented to adoption
- Adoption made with consent of all

**Answer: Senior most wife = Adoptive Mother, Others = Stepmothers**

**Reasoning:**
1. ✅ **Section 14** provides: When adoption made with consent of multiple wives
2. ✅ **Senior most in marriage** = adoptive mother
3. ✅ **Others** = stepmothers
4. ✅ Child's relationship:
   - With **senior most wife** = adoptive mother (full rights)
   - With **other wives** = stepmothers (no adoptive parent rights)

**Determining Senior Most:**
- Based on **date of marriage**
- Wife married first = senior most
- Others = junior wives

---

**Conclusion:**

When M adopts with consent of all three wives, the **senior most wife** (married first) becomes the **adoptive mother**, while F2 and F3 become **stepmothers**. The child has full adoptive relationship only with the senior most wife.
