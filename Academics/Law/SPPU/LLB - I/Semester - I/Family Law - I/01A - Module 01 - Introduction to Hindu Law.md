2. Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956
3. Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956
4. Hindu Succession Act, 1956

**⚖️ Legal Principle**
- Codified law **overrides** all prior law (custom or otherwise)
- Unless **express saving** provided

**👥 Application (Section 2, HMA 1955)**

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Hindu by Religion** | Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, Buddhists (including converts/reconverts) |

### 2. Sources of Hindu Law

**🏛️ Ancient Sources (Hierarchy)**

```
Sruti (Highest)
    ↓
Smriti
    ↓
Digests & Commentaries
    ↓
Puranas
    ↓
Custom (Can override texts)
```

**📜 Sruti**
- **Meaning**: "What is heard"
- **Contents**: 4 Vedas (Rig, Yajur, Sam, Atharva) + Brahmanas
- **Authority**: Ultimate source (divine revelation)

**📝 Smriti**
- **Meaning**: "That which was remembered"
- **Notable Writers**: Manu, Yajnavalkya, Narada, etc.
- **Three Categories**:
  - Achar (morality)
  - Vyavahar (procedural rules)
  - Prayaschit (penal provisions)

**Case Law:**
- **Shyam Sunder Prasad Singh v. State of Bihar (1980)**: Custom/usage can override Smriti when there is divergence

**📚 Digests and Commentaries**
- **Mitakshara**: Commentary on Yajnavalka smriti (Vijnaneshwar)
- **Dayabhag**: Digest by Jimutvahan
- **Result**: Formation of schools of law

**⚖️ Custom**
- **Kinds**: Local, Class/Caste, Family, Business/Trade
- **Essentials (ACRON)**:
  - **A**ncient
  - **C**ertain
  - **R**easonable
  - **O**ngoing (continuous)
  - **N**ot against public policy/law

**📜 Proof of Custom**
- Burden on person alleging
- Multiple instances required (one instance insufficient)
- Repeated judicial recognition = no further proof needed

**Case Laws:**
- **Prakash vs Parmeshwari**: One instance does not prove a custom
- **Ujagar vs Jeo**: Repeated judicial recognition - no further proof needed

**🏛️ Modern Sources**

1. **Justice, Equity and Good Conscience**
   - Applied when no rule available
   - **Case**: Kenchava V. Girimalappa (1924) - murderer disqualified from inheritance

2. **Precedent/Judicial Decisions**
   - Hierarchy: Supreme Court → High Court
   - Binding force on lower courts

3. **Legislation**
   - Acts of Parliament
   - Codified law takes precedence

## 🧠 MNEMONICS

**Sources Hierarchy**: **S**ruti **S**mriti **C**ommentaries **P**uranas **C**ustom = **SSCPC**

**Custom Essentials**: **A**ncient **C**ertain **R**easonable **O**ngoing **N**ot against law = **ACRON**

1. ❌ Confusing "codified" with "statutory" - Hindu Law is BOTH
2. ❌ Forgetting Scheduled Tribes exception
3. ❌ Not understanding "after" in Section 6(a) HMGA = "in absence of"
4. ❌ Mixing up Mitakshara sub-schools
5. ❌ Forgetting that custom can override texts
