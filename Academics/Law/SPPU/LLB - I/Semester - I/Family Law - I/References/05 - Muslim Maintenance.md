## Case Laws

### 1. Mohd. Ahmed Khan v. Shah Bano Begum & Others - *Landmark Case*

> **📌 Mohd. Ahmed Khan v. Shah Bano Begum & Others**
>
> The appellant, a Muslim, was married in 1932 and in 1975 he drove her out of the matrimonial home. The respondent filed a petition under section 125 CrPC in April 1978 against the appellant claiming maintenance at the rate of Rs. 500 per month. The appellant divorced the respondent by an irrevocable talaq in November 1978.
>
> **Key Points:**
>
> - The Supreme Court held that **Section 125 was applicable to all irrespective of their religion**
> - Clause (b) of section 125(1) contains no words of limitation so as to justify exclusion of Muslim women
> - There had been a lot of hue and cry by Muslim fundamentalists after this revolutionary judgment of the apex Court which was truly intended to protect the interest of Muslim women from oppression
> - Consequently, the central government was compelled to bring a legislation nullifying the judgment of the Supreme Court
> - Parliament passed a **Muslim Women's (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986** providing for other remedies to Muslim women
> - This new Act allows a Muslim woman to avail remedy available under section 125 only if the husband consents to it

### 2. Gulam Rashid Ali Vs. Kaushar Praveen & Another (2010) DMC 371 Delhi HC

> **📌 Gulam Rashid Ali Vs. Kaushar Praveen & Another**
>
> That even a Muslim divorced woman would be entitled to claim maintenance from a Muslim husband till she has not married. This being a **beneficial piece of legislation**, the benefit must accrue to the divorced Muslim women.

### 3. S. Abdul Salam Vs. S. Ghousiya Bi & Others 2007(3) ALT (Cri) 61 (AP)

> **📌 S. Abdul Salam Vs. S. Ghousiya Bi & Others**
>
> When two Acts cover two different situations, the **special enactment prevail over the general enactment**. Furthermore, Section 3 of the Act will override the provisions of any other law for the time being in force. Section 3(1) of the Act begins with a non-obstante clause 'notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force' makes it clear that the provisions of the 1986 Act would apply to the divorced woman with regard to a reasonable and fair provision for maintenance of the amount of mehar or any of the other conditions in respect of a divorced woman and is entitled for maintenance under section 3 of the Act.
>
> **Held:** Her remedy is to file an application under section 3(1)(a) of the Act, but not under section 125, Cr.P.C.

### 4. Danial Latifi & Another Vs. Union of India 2001 (2) ALD (Cri) 787 (SC)

> **📌 Danial Latifi & Another Vs. Union of India**
>
> A divorced Muslim woman who has not remarried and who is not able to maintain herself after Iddat period can proceed as provided under section 4 of the Act against her relatives who are liable to maintain her in proportion to the properties which they inherit on her death according to Muslim Law from such divorced woman including her children and parents.
>
> **Key Points:**
>
> - If any of the relatives being unable to pay maintenance, the Magistrate may direct the **State Wakf Board** established under the Act to pay such maintenance
> - The provisions of the Act do not offend **Articles 14, 15 and 21** of the Constitution of India

---

### 5. Mumtazben Jushabbhai Sipahi Vs. Mahebubkhan Usmankhan Pathan & Another (1999) DMC 71 Guj. HC

> **📌 Mumtazben Jushabbhai Sipahi Vs. Mahebubkhan Usmankhan Pathan & Another**
>
> Under Section 4 of the Muslim Women Act a divorced woman is entitled to get maintenance from her relatives such as her children or parents or from Wakf Board if she is not able to maintain herself after the iddat period from the provision and maintenance made and paid by her former husband.
>
> **Key Point:** There is no provision in the Muslim Women Act which nullifies the orders passed by the Magistrate under Section 125 or 127 of the Cr.P.C. ordering the husband to pay maintenance to the divorced woman or takes away the vested rights which are crystallized by the orders passed under section 125 or 127 of the Cr.P.C.

---

## Conclusion

The maintenance provisions of the Muslim Law are different from other Personal laws. More efforts and contribution of judicial system and legislation are required to improvise the condition of the wives under Muslim law.

The concept of maintenance is to **protect the rights of the wife** and protect her a dignified life and even after dissolution of marriage the husband is in the liability to provide maintenance to his wife if she is not able to maintain herself. It is not only provided to the wife but also to **children, parents, grandparents and grandchildren and other relatives by blood**.
