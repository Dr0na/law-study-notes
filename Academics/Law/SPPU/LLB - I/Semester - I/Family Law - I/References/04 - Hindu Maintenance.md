## Hindu Maintenance

## Introduction
The right to maintenance, that is to say, the right to be supported and cared for by another. The duty to rear up a family and with it the duty to look after and support those members of the family who were unable to look after themselves by reason of their physical disability. These would include the newly born till they acquire, on becoming adult, the capacity to form and rear up their own family, the wife who rears them up, and the aged parents who had in their youth similarly brought up and supported the family, The right of a person to maintenance and the corresponding obligation of another to provide it, are in their very nature, dependent upon a consideration of the character of relationship between them, their means mode of living.
The means and the mode of living are material to determine the quantum of the obligation. The right of maintenance includes all the reasonable necessaries of life such as food, clothes and shelter. This might create an obligation which is the outcome of legal relationship.

## Definition
Manu has said-Old infirm parents, a dedicated wife and the minor and the minor children are to be maintained by committing even thousands of offences.
In Raghubar singh v. Gulab singh, that right to maintenance of Hindu wife is a pre-existing right that existed even under Shastric Hindu Law. It was not created by 1937 or 1946 Acts.

## Liability

- Personal liability
The Dharmashastra lays personal liability on every Hindu to provide maintenance to certain relations.
Old law-: The following relations were entitled to claim maintenance.

- Wife
- Minor children
- Unmarried daughters
- Aged parent
The persons who were liable to maintain them were as follows: -
1)The husband was bound to maintain his wife
2)The father was bond to maintain his minor sons and unmarried Daughters.
3)The sons were bound to maintain their old parents.

New law-: under the Hindu Adoption and maintenance Act 1956 by way of innovations over  the old law, The illegitimate daughters are also entitled to maintenance from their father and widowed daughter-in-law can claim maintenance from her father-in-law.

- Limited liability
The concept of limited liability in relation to certain relations
1) Karta’s liability-: According to Mitakshara the Karta of a joint Hindu family is legally bound to provide for maintenance to all male members, their wives and children. On the death of any male member, he is liable to maintain his widow and his minor children. This liability depends upon the fact that the entire joint family property is under the control of karta .
2) Heir’s liability-: The liability arising out of succession binds the heir to provide maintenance to those dependents of the deceased, whom he was morally and legally bound to maintain during his lifetime. The reason was simple as such dependents of the deceased had a right to be maintained out of his property
Example-: There was no personal liability on any Hindu to maintain his sister, but if he inherits property from his father, he would be bound to maintain her as the father was bound to maintain her during his lifetime, provided she was unmarried.
3)Government liability-: The third category of liability lies on the government if it has acquired the property.

## Maintenance

- WIFE
Who is wife?
Under section 18 of the Hindu adoption and maintenance Act, two separate rights have been conferred on the wife.
1) Right to maintenance
2) Right to separate residence.
Before the Act of 1956 came into force it was treated as a binding duty of every husband to maintain his wife, irrespective of any property with him. Since it was regarded as a personal liability, it hardly required the possession of any ancestral or separate property with the husband as a condition precedent for entitling the wife to claim maintenance from him.
This right exists for the whole span of her marital life as it is one of the necessary concomitants of marriage between them. The liability of the husband is not affected by the fact that she is quite rich. The moral obligation of the husband has been rendered into a legal obligation, as the obligation is derived from the relationship between a Hindu male and his dependents.
Hindu law restricts the right of alienation of a husband so that he or the Karta of joint Hindu family does not alienate the property in a manner that the wife and other dependents are not virtually deprived of their right of maintenance.
The wife is entitled to claim maintenance either out of the share of her husband in the joint Hindu family or of his own separate property. The wife living separately from her husband without a reasonable justification cannot claim maintenance because in that case she herself is guilty of the breach of marital obligations.
When she can claim maintenance
### a) The husband is guilty of desertion, i.e. the husband, without any reasonable justification or without her consent or against her wishes, abandons her or willfully neglects her;
### b) The husband has treated her with such cruelty as to cause a reasonable apprehension in her mind that it will be harmful or injurious to live with her husband.
### c) he is suffering from a virulent form of leprosy;
### d) he has any other wife living;
### e) he keeps a concubine in the same house in which his wife is living or habitually resides with a concubine elsewhere;
### f) he has ceased to be a Hindu by conversion to another religion;
### g) there is any other cause justifying her living separately.
Maintenance in the present context includes provisions for food, clothing residence, education and medical aid and treatment.
Obula konda redid v. c. pedda venkat laxmi
The Andhra Pradesh high court interpreted the term “Wife” used in section 18 in a wider connotation. The court said that the term ‘wife’ does not signify wife whose marriage took place only under the Hindu marriage Act 1955, as this interpretation would strictly narrow down is meaning. The term would also include such wife whose marriage would be void within the meaning of that Act, so as to enable her to claim maintenance under the present Act.
Smt. Tejaswari v. Aravinda tejas Chandra
Recently court further observed that husband cannot deny for the maintenance if wife is highly qualified who sacrifices her lucrative career for sake of her family and if her husband neglects or refuses to maintain her on the ground that, she is highly educated and is capable of earning it is not a sufficient ground to refuse maintenance.
Malappa v. malappa, 1970
If the wife refuses to live with the husband on the ground that he has kept another wife, that would not amount t desertion by the wife and hence it would not bring her right to maintenance to an end under this section.
kesarbai v. hari Bhai
According to the rendering of this section- if the concubine is residing in the same house, the wife acquires the right of separate residence and maintenance.
Bhodra reddi v. shanthamma
But in the above circumstances while the concubine is living in the same house and the wife is residing separately, she could claim maintenance under section 18(2)(g).
When she cannot claim maintenance
The wife does not remain entitled to separate residence and maintenance-

- When she become convert,
- When she becomes unchaste,
- When she resides separately without any reasonable justification,
- When the wife lives separately as a result of compromise and waives her right of maintenance.


- WIDOWED DAUGHTER-IN-LAW
Who is she?
According to ancient texts the father-in-law was neither under any legal obligation nor any personal obligation to provide maintenance to widowed daughter-in-law. It was merely a moral obligation. If the father-in-law received some property by survivorship on the death of his son, who died leaving behind his widow, he would be under legal obligations to maintain the widow of such a son. Section 19 of the Act does not laydown a personal obligation upon the father-in-law, to maintain his son’s widow.
S.V. Parthasarathy Battachariar and others v. S. Rajeswari and others, Madras High Court observed that father-in-law is liable to pay maintenance to widowed daughter-in-law if husband of widow is not known for more than seven years and deemed to have been died.
Mst. Rupa v. shriyawati, It lays down only a moral obligation upon the father-in-law to maintain his daughter-in-law, but after the death of the father-in-law, whosoever inherits his self-acquired property, is legally bound to maintain the daughter-in-law of such deceased person.
When she can claim maintenance
According to section 19, any Hindu whether her marriage took place either before the commencement of the present Act or thereafter, on the death of her husband, would be entitled to maintenance from her father-in-law to the extent and so long-
### a) She is unable to maintain herself out of her own earnings or other property; or
### b) She is unable to obtain maintenance from the estate of her husband: or
### c) She is unable to obtain maintenance from the estate of her father; or
### d) She is unable to obtain maintenance from the estate of her mother; or
### e) She is unable to obtain maintenance from the estate of her son; or
### f) She is unable to obtain maintenance from the estate of her daughters; or
### g) She is unable to obtain maintenance from the estate of her son or daughter;
### h) If the father-in-law has no coparcenary property in his possession out of which she has not obtained a share, and
### i) she has remained unmarried. Where the father-in-law has coparcenary as well as self-acquired property is sufficient enough to enable him and his wife to maintain themselves, the widowed daughter-in-law acquires a right to get herself maintained out of the earnings of the coparcenary property. In such a case there would be not any obligation upon the earning of coparcenary property with respect to the maintenance of father-in-law and wife.

When she cannot claim maintenance
Section 19(2) lay down those conditions in which the liability to maintain the daughter-in-law comes to an end.

- Where the father-in-law does not have any means for maintenance out of coparcenary property which was owned by her deceased husband;
- Where the widowed daughter-in-law received any share in the coparcenary property;
- Where she has remarried;
- Where she has converted into other religion.
The widowed daughter-in-law could claim maintenance in the property notwithstanding the fact that she does not live in her father-in-law’s home.

- PARENTS AND CHILDREN-
Section 20 of the Act provides for the maintenance of aged infirm parents, legitimate and illegitimate children. The tern ‘children’ does not include grandson and granddaughter. The liability to maintain such relations is personal and is not dependent on the possession of property and would cease with the death of the person liable to maintain.
The legitimate and illegitimate children are entitled to maintenance from their parents only during the period of their minority. The expression ‘children’ includes the adopted children so long they are minor.
The liability of any person to maintain his aged infirm parents and unmarried daughter extends in so far as any one of them is unable to maintain himself or herself out of his own earnings or other property.
In this context, the term ‘parent’ includes a childless step mother but not a step-father. The expression parents and children in the personal context would include the adoptive father and adoptive mother.
Chandra kishore v. Nanak chand
It was held by the Delhi High Court that the obligation of a Hindu father includes the obligation to maintain unmarried daughter not only for purpose of her day-to-day expenses but also in respect of reasonable expenses of her marriage. Thus, a Hindu is obliged to meet marriage expenses of his daughter, whether there is joint family property or not a joint family property.


- Maintenance of legitimate and illegitimate son-:
Amireddi Raja Gopala Rao v. Amireddi Sitharamamma and others
The question arose whether illegitimate sons of a Sudra from Brahmin concubine are entitled to maintenance from the estate of the deceased father. The other question in issue was whether the right of an illegitimate son of wife who is entitled to maintenance under Hindu law still exists.

I.Krishna Prasad Rao v.  Jayasri and others
The Andhra Pradesh High Court in held the liability of the parents to maintain their children as absolute. According to the court it cannot be circumvented on the ground that such duty arises only if the child surrenders to the protection and care of the parent, such conditions cannot be imposed in awarding maintenance.

- Legitimate and illegitimate daughter-:
Under Hindu law an unmarried daughter was entitled to claim maintenance from her father and on the death of her father, she was entitled to be maintained out of his estate. But such rights were not available to an illegitimate daughter.
Under the present law as contained in the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act 1956, whether legitimate or illegitimate both can claim maintenance from their parents. but the obligation of the parents to maintain them would be dependant on the fact that the daughters are unable to maintain themselves by their own separate earnings and property.
Daughters can claim maintenance from her parents so long as she is unmarried. There is no obligation on the parents to maintain a married daughter but on her becoming a widow, the obligation is revived.
Thadisina chinnababu Rao v. Kum Thadisina Sarala
The court held that under section 20(3) of Maintenance Act, an unmarried daughter can claim maintenance from her parents    irrespective of religion to which she belongs even after attaining majority.

- Aged and infirm parents-:
The sons and daughters are under an obligation to maintain their aged and infirm parents, who are unable to maintain themselves out of their own property and earnings. Under the old Hindu law only the sons were under a legal obligation to maintain his aged parents.
Now this liability has been imposed upon the daughters also. The terms ‘father’ and ‘mother’ have not been defined under the present law yet step mother can be said to have been included within the meaning of section 20.
S. jagjit Singh Bhatia v. S. Balbir Singh Bhatia
It was observed by the Delhi H.C. that – the Hindu son is personally obliged to maintain his aged parents irrespective of, the fact that whether he inherits his father’s estate or not, numerous family properties in the family settlement, son’s personal income from business or family properties, standard of life maintained by the family members. The court also held that the son would be liable to pay a definite amount per month to the aged parents and also the arrears if any.

- DEPENDENTS
A list of the dependents entitled to claim maintenance from the heirs of the deceased as has been provided for by the Act.
### a) His or her father
### b) His or her mother
### c) His widow, so long she does not remarry.
Panna lal Hazara v. Fhul Mani Hazara
The Calcutta high court held that a step-son is under an obligation to maintain his step-mother because she is the widow of his father. The liability is not personal but related to the fact that he had inherited the property from his father who was the husband of the step-mother. The liability would be limited to the extent of the property, he inherited from his father but the liability will come into operation only if the widow had not inherited anything from her deceased husband.

In case of grandson’s widow, also from her father-in-law’s estate.
T.A Laxmi Narasmba v. Sundermma
The Andhra Pradesh High Court deliverd an important judgment, where it held that it is only a moral obligation upon the father-in-law to give maintenance allowance to the widowed daughter-in-law but it turns into a legal liability upon one to whom the father-in-law gives his property either through a will or through gift.

- His or her minor illegitimate son, so long as he remains a minor;
- His or her minor illegitimate daughter so long as she remains unmarried.

## 5)Other Persons
### 1. Disqualified heirs and their wives-:
Whenever a son or other heir was disqualified from inheritance on account of physical or mental disability, he was entitled to maintenance for himself and his family out of the property which he would have inherited but for disability. The Act does not provide for maintenance of such persons.
### 2.Concubine or Avarudha stree-:
The term “Avarudha stree”applies to women, kept permanently by a person in his house as confined under his own protection in a manner as to make it impossible for her to have connection with a stranger. The woman in order to come within the definition of ‘Avarudh stree’ must be a concubine living under a man’s immediate protection and control. Their relationship need not be secret but the evidence must show that she lived with the man openly as a member of his family.
Under the old Hindu law, a concubine could not claim maintenance from her paramour during his life time, but after his death, if she remained faithful to him so long he was alive, she acquired a right of maintenance against his estate, whether ancestral or self-acquired. But her right to maintenance is conditional to her chastity. The Hindu Adoption and maintenance Act, 1956 does not provide for the maintenance of a concubine.
### 3.Gharjamai-:
Prior to the present Act, Gharjamai had some right to claim maintenance from his father-in-law. But this right does not exist any longer after the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 was passed


## Amount Of Maintenance
No fixed rule can, however, be laid down with respect to the amount of maintenance. Each case is to be judged according to its own merit. Maintenance depends upon the totality of all the fact the situation including the amount of free estate, a survey of the conditions and necessities and the rights of the members.
