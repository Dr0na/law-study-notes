# Sources of Muslim Law

## Introduction

Various sources of Islamic law are used by Islamic jurisprudence to elucidate the **Sharia**, the body of Islamic law. The primary sources, accepted universally by all Muslims, are the **Quran** and **Sunnat**. The Quran is the holy scripture of Islam, believed by Muslims to be the direct and unaltered word of Allah. The Sunnat consists of the religious actions and quotations of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad and narrated through his Companions and Shia Imams. However, some schools of jurisprudence use different methods to judge the source's level of authenticity.

Sources of Muslim Law are broadly categorised as follows:

---

## Primary Sources vs Secondary Sources

### Primary Sources

- The sources that the Prophet Mohammad directed will be the primary sources
- These are to be followed in their respective order of priority
- They are also called **formal sources**
- The whole of Muslim personal law is based on these

### Secondary Sources

- These sources explain or modify the primary sources
- They deal with the needs of the Islamic society in the modern era
- These are also called **extraneous sources**
- Some of the personal rules may find places in the sources, e.g., customs

## Detailed Primary Sources

### 1. Quran

The term **"Quran"** has its roots in the Arabic word 'Qurra' and refers to **'the reading'** or **'what ought to be read'**. The first revelation (Wahi) came to the Prophet in **609 A.D**. They continued for about **23 years**. These revelations were the messages of God made by Angel Gabriel. These revelations were given out then to the people through the preaching of the Prophet.

These delivered messages were remembered and some were reduced to writings on animal skin, palm leaves, etc. After the Prophet's death, these were collected, assembled and then systematically presented under the authority of the third Caliph, **Osman**.

#### Salient Features of Quran

1. **Divine Origin**: The religious book has a divine origin. It is believed that these were the words of God himself and the Prophet mere uttered these words. Thus, it is unchangeable and its authority is beyond reproach. The Quran is the **Al-furqan**, the one that shows the truth from falsehood and the right from the wrong.

2. **First Source**: It is the first and fundamental source of Muslim law and Islamic principles. It is ultimate source of laws.

3. **Structure**: It is in form of verses, each verse is called an **'Ayat'**. There are **6237 ayats** in **114 chapters**, each called **'Sura'**. The holy book is arranged topic wise with respective titles. The first chapter praises the almighty God. Other chapters include:

   - **Surat-un-nisa** (chapter relating to women)
   - **Surat-ul-noor** (rules relating to home-life)
   - **Surat-ul-talaq** (the rules relating to divorce)

---

#### Criticism of Quran as a Source of Muslim Law

1. **Mixture of religion, law and morality**: It is believed that the verses relating to law were revealed at Medina while the ones relating to religion and mortality were revealed at Mecca. In some places in the book, all three can't be separated at all. Thus, the whole of Quran cannot be source of a law, instead we refer to the **200 odd law-making ayats** scattered all over the book as the basic source of Muslim Law.

2. **Different forms of legal rules**: It has many categories, the ones that remove social evils like child infanticide, gambling etc, and the ones that create specifics so as to solve daily life legal problems as well as providing for the basis of juristic interpretations or inferences.

3. **Unchangeable**: The Quran can be in no way altered or changed, thus, even the courts of law have no authority to change the apparent meaning of the verses as it does not have an earthly origin.

4. **Incompleteness**: In the 200 odd verses of law in the Quran, only **80 or so deal with the personal law**. Hence, we say that it is not a complete code of Muslim personal law; it only lays down the basic principles. Further, on many an issue, the Quran is silent. With the spread of Islam, the necessity arose to explain and supplement the Quran so as to deal with the new problems of a growing Islamic society.

### 2. Sunnatt or Ahadis: Traditions of the Prophet

In the pre-Islam Arabia, Sunnat meant an ancient and continuous usage that has been established in the society. **Sunnat** literally means the **"trodden path"**. Sunnat or Ahadis means the traditions of the Prophet. It means that whatever the Prophet said or did without the reference to God is his tradition. The Prophets acts and words are believed to have been inspired by God and thus are treated as internal revelations. Thus, tradition is another source of law in the language of the Prophet. So wherever the Quran is silent, the Sunnat /Ahadis were referred to.

Everything the Prophet did or said as well as his silence was taken to be a rule under authority except when he used to give the revelations of God.

---

#### Types of Sunnat

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| **Sunnatt-ul-Qaul** | Refers the words spoken by the Prophet |
| **Sunnatt-ul-Fail** | Includes the conduct and behaviour of the Prophet |
| **Sunnatt-ul-Taqrir** | By his silence, the Prophet gave an implied approval to pre-Islamic customs, practices and questions |

---

#### Narrators of the Traditions

The traditions noticed by competent and qualified person were treated as authoritative if they were found to be reliable. The competence was judged by the mental understanding, power of retention, righteous conduct of a person and on the basis of whether he was a Muslim or not.

| Rank | Narrator | Description | Reliability |
| :--- | :------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| **1** | **Companions of the Prophet** | The Muslims who lived with the Prophet during his lifetime and were close to him | Most reliable |
| **2** | **Successors of the Companions** | The Muslims who came in contact with the Companions of the Prophet | Second in reliability |
| **3** | **Successors of successors** | The Muslims who were in constant companionship of the Successors | Last in the line |

> **📌 Key Point**: The further a narrator from the Prophet, the lesser authority is given to his narration.

---

#### Kinds of Tradition

| Type | Description | Acceptance |
| :--- | :---------- | :--------- |
| **Ahadis-i-Mutwatir** | The universally accepted traditions. There is no doubt as to their certainty and have been narrated by many people | All sects of Islam follow them |
| **Ahadis-i-Mashoor** | The popular traditions which were narrated by the companions of the Prophet and have found mass acceptance | Source of law for a majority and not all |
| **Ahadis-i-Ahad** | The isolated traditions that have not been followed regularly or by many | Generally, the acceptance and practice is a localised one |

> **ℹ️ Note**: Traditions were passed on from generation to generation and soon became the practice. They were not written or systematically arranged initially. The importance and role of traditions is immense but another source of law was needed to deal with the expanding Islamic Society.

### 3. Ijma: Unanimous Decisions of the Jurists

**Ijma** means the opinion of the learned jurists. When persons knowledgeable in law would agree upon a point, such consensual opinion was referred to as Ijma. Thus, Ijma is the unanimous decision of jurists for a particular question with reference to that age or communal legislation. It is through the tradition of the Prophet that Ijma derives its validity and authority as a source of law.

> **📌 Key Quote**: The Prophet is believed to have said that, **'God will not allow his people to agree on an error'**.

---

#### Formation of Ijma

Whenever law needed a new principle, the jurists used to give a consensual opinion so as to enable a solution. To be a jurist or **Mujtahid**, it was essential that a person was:

- A Muslim with adequate knowledge of law
- Competent to form logical deductions

**Ijtihad** refers to the process of creating law through consensus on the basis of 'exercise of one's reasoning so as to create a new rule of law'. The Ijma had to be justified with references to the principles given in the Quran or the tradition as well as public policy, interest of the community and equity. The **Mujtahtids** are the recognised interpreters of law.

---

#### Kinds of Ijma

| Rank | Type | Description | Authority |
| :--- | :--- | :---------- | :-------- |
| **1** | **Ijma of the Companions** | The consensual opinion of the Companions | Most authoritative and accurate. It cannot be overruled or modified by subsequent Ijmas |
| **2** | **Ijma of the Jurists** | The opinion of learned scholars | Next best Ijma after the Ijma of the Companions |
| **3** | **Ijma of the People** | At times, the mass acceptance of a principle as law was also accepted | Of little consequence with respect to core issues and principles of the Islam |

> **📌 Key Point**: The authority of Ijma depends upon the capabilities of the people participating in its formation.

---

### 4. Qiyas: Analogical Deduction

**Qiyas** refers to **'measurement'** in the Arabic language. It also refers to comparing a thing in relation to a standard or **'to establish an analogy'**. Some have described it as the analogical deduction from the reason of a text to a case not actually covered by its language.

> **ℹ️ Simple Explanation**: It is a method of comparing a problem in present times to a similar problem for which the solution is provided in the texts.

---

## Detailed Secondary Sources

### 1. Urf or Taamul: Custom

Before Islam, customary law governed Arabia. Then the Prophet abolished most of them, as they were un-Islamic and bad. Some customs, however, were continued due to the Prophet's silent approval. Some were even included in his traditions. Otherwise, some customs survived due to their incorporation in the Ijma.

#### Areas Where Customs Still Apply

Customs are still applicable to Muslims with regard to:

- **Agricultural lands**
- **Charities and religious endowments**
- **Wills, adoption and legacies**: The customary law will apply unless a Muslim expressly states that the Shariat should regulate them

---

### 2. Judicial Decisions

The Privy Council decided many a case related to Muslim law. These cases continue to have a binding force on all the High courts and the lower courts of India and a persuasive value in the Supreme Court of India. This box of precedents will lose its binding force only if the Supreme Court overrules a particular decision. Elsewhere, an opinion seems to be forming that judges are now making the law the way the early Muslim jurists did.

Judgements of a superior Court are an authority for the lower courts. Plus the judgements of the higher court become the law of the land and thus are binding on all the lower courts. This is called the principle of **Precedents**.

#### Areas Where Courts Have Developed Law

Law of pre-emption, validity of gifts to minor wife, additional grounds of dissolution of marriage and even interest on unpaid dower are few of the fields where courts have stepped in with new interpretations or discretion on the basis of justice, equity and good conscience to develop the law further. Many a times, legislations have overruled or negated the rules; they are still a source of law.

---

### 3. Legislations

God is the Supreme legislator as per Islam. Thus, sometimes, legislative modifications are also treated as encroachment. Still, there are a few acts that modify or lay down principles of Muslim law and serve as a source of law for the courts with respect to the content covered by them.

#### Important Legislations

| Act | Year | Key Provision |
| :--- | :--- | :------------ |
| **The Mussalman Waqf Validating Act** | 1913 | It merely re-established the validity of family-wakfs |
| **The Child Marriage Restraint Act** | - | It makes the marriage of a boy under 21 years of age and a girl under 18 years a 'child marriage' and punishable without affecting the validity of it |
| **The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act** | 1937 | It reiterated the Muslim Stand that custom couldn't be an independent source of Muslim law all the time |
| **Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act** | 1939 | It provided rights to judicial divorce under the grounds mentioned in it to women who traditionally had no independent right to seek divorce |
| **Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act** | 1986 | The issues of maintenance after divorce, maintenance during iddat are dealt with comprehensively |

> **ℹ️ Note**: There are other Acts too which deal with Muslim personal Law. Some lay down the procedure rather than altering substantive rules of Muslim personal Law.

---

## Conclusion

The sources of Muslim law form a comprehensive hierarchy starting with the divine revelations in the **Quran**, followed by the traditions of the Prophet (**Sunnat**), the consensus of jurists (**Ijma**), and analogical reasoning (**Qiyas**). These primary sources are supplemented by secondary sources including customs, judicial decisions, and legislative enactments that adapt Islamic law to modern circumstances while maintaining its fundamental principles.
