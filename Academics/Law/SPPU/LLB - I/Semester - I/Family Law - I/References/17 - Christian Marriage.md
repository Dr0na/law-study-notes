# Christian Marriage

## Introduction

Marriage, as is seen in Christian tradition, is not merely a civil contract nor is it purely a religious contract. It is seen as a **contract according to the law of nature**, and by itself an institution. A marriage among Christians is traditionally understood as the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others, and Indian law follows suit, so that India does not allow for the possibility of same-sex marriage as it has been celebrated by some churches in other countries in recent years.

It is specifically provided under **section 4 of the Act** that every marriage in India between persons, one or both of whom is or are a Christian or Christians, shall be solemnized in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Christian Marriage Act and any such marriage solemnized otherwise than in accordance with such provisions shall be **void**.

- The expression **'Christian'** means persons professing the Christian religion
- The term **'Church'** includes any chapel or other building generally used for public Christian worship

The Christian Law of Marriage in India is governed by the **Indian Christian Marriage Act of 1872**.

## Conclusion

It can be concluded that the Indian Christian Marriage Act is comprehensive enough to deal with matters regarding solemnization of marriages among Christians in India when both the parties to the marriage are Christians. But where one of the parties to a marriage in India is a Christian and the other party is a non-Christian the best course to adopt is to solemnize the marriage under the **Special Marriage Act, 1954**. Or in the alternative, if a marriage has been solemnized between a Christian and a non-Christian under the provisions of the Indian Christian Marriage Act, it can be registered again under the provisions of **section 15 of the Special Marriage Act of 1954** by way of caution.
