## ⚖️ Muslim Marriage

### 📌 Definition and Nature of Nikah

#### Definition

**Nikah** (Muslim marriage) is:
- **Not a sacrament** (unlike Hindu marriage)
- A **civil contract** between a man and woman to live as husband and wife
- A **devotional act (ibadat)**

#### Nature of Muslim Marriage

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Legal Nature** | Civil contract |
| **Religious Nature** | Ibadat (devotional act) |
| **Status** | Sunnat (practice of the Prophet) |
| **Obligation** | Wajib (obligatory) for physically fit Muslims |

#### Prophetic Traditions

According to the Prophet:
- ✅ Marriage is **obligatory (wajib)** for every physically fit Muslim
- ✅ Marriage is equal to **jehad** (holy war)
- ✅ "He who marries completes half his religion"

> ⚠️ **Important**: Singlehood, monasticism, and celibacy are **forbidden** under Islam.

---

### ✅ Essentials and Formalities of a Valid Marriage

> 📌 **Exam Tip**: Remember the 5 essentials: (1) Proposal & Acceptance, (2) Capacity, (3) Guardianship (if minor), (4) Absence of Impediments, (5) Formalities.

#### Overview

According to Muslim marriage law:
- ❌ **No prescribed ceremonies** or formalities required
- ❌ **No special rites and rituals** needed
- ✅ Legal and reasonable conditions may be appended (if not opposed to Islam)

---

#### 1. 📝 Proposal and Acceptance (Ijab and Qubul)

##### Requirements

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Proposal (Ijab)** | Must be expressed |
| **Acceptance (Qubul)** | Must be expressed |
| **Timing** | Both at **one meeting** |
| **Witnesses** | Two male OR one male and two female |
| **Witness Status** | Must be sane and adult Muslims |

##### Important Points

- ✅ Both proposal and acceptance must be at **one meeting**
  - ❌ Proposal at one meeting + acceptance at another = **Invalid**
- ✅ Usual form of proposal: *"I have married myself to you"*
- ✅ Usual form of acceptance: *"I have consented"*
- ✅ Words must be uttered in each other's presence and hearing
- ✅ Witnesses must be **sane and adult Muslims**

> ⚠️ **Critical**: The whole transaction must be completed at **one meeting**.

---

#### 2. 🧑‍⚖️ Capacity to Contract Marriage

> 📌 **Exam Tip**: Under Muslim law, every Muslim who is of sound mind and has attained puberty has the capacity to marry.

---

##### 📅 Age of Majority

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Muslim Law** | Puberty = Majority (for marriage, dower, divorce) |
| **Indian Majority Act, 1875** | **Does NOT apply** to marriage, dower, divorce |
| **Result** | Muslim becomes competent at puberty, even if under 18 years |

> 🧠 **Memory Aid**: "Puberty = Majority" in Muslim law for marriage matters.

##### Meaning of Puberty

| School/Law | Age/Definition |
|------------|---------------|
| **Hanafi Law** | Presumed at **15 years** |
| **Shia Female** | Begins with menstruation |
| **General Definition** | Period when persons become capable of begetting/bearing children |
| **India (Females)** | Usually 13-14 years |
| **Hedaya (Earliest)** | Boy: 12 years; Girl: 9 years |
| **Privy Council (Shia)** | Girl: **9 years** (Sadiq Ali v. Jai Ishwar) |
| **Presumption (Absence of Evidence)** | **15 years** |

##### Impact of Legislation

| Act | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| **Indian Majority Act, 1875** | Left Muslim law of marriage untouched |
| **Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929** | Does not make child marriage void; only provides punishments |
| **Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006** | See case below |

##### Case Law: Shafin Jahan v. Asokan K.M. (2018 SC)

- **Facts**: 16-year-old Muslim girl challenged Kerala HC decision terming her marriage invalid
- **Held**: Marriage held **valid**
- **Principle**: Muslim law recognizes marriage at puberty, even if under 18

- Guardian acts on behalf of the incapable person

---

#### 3. 👨‍👩‍👧 Guardianship in Marriage (Jabar)

> 📌 **Exam Tip**: Remember the order of guardianship - Father → Paternal Grandfather → Brother → Mother → Others.

##### Order of Guardianship (Sunni Law)

1. **Father**
2. **Paternal grandfather** (how highsoever)
3. **Brother and other paternal relatives** (as per order of inheritance)
4. **Mother**
5. **Other maternal relations** (within prohibited degrees)
6. **The government**

##### Shia Law

| Guardian | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **Father** | ✅ Recognized |
| **Paternal grandfather** (how highsoever) | ✅ Recognized |
| **Others** | ❌ Not recognized (unless ratified by minor on attaining majority) |

> ⚠️ **Important**: Under Shia law, only father and paternal grandfather are guardians. Marriage by others is ineffective unless ratified.

---

##### Effect of Apostasy on Guardianship

| Situation | Rule |
|---------|------|
| **General Rule** | Apostate has no right to contract infant daughter's marriage |
| **Freedom of Religion Act, 1950** | Abrogated the rule - no forfeiture of rights on conversion |
| **Case Law** | **Gul Mohammad v. Mussammat Wazir**: Power to contract minor in marriage is a right; not forfeited by conversion |

---

##### 🔄 Option of Puberty

> 🧠 **Remember**: Minor can ratify OR repudiate marriage on attaining puberty.

**Definition**: A Muslim minor contracted in marriage by guardian may, on attaining puberty, choose to:
- ✅ **Ratify the marriage**, OR
- ❌ **Repudiate it**

##### When Marriage is by Father/Paternal Grandfather

| Status | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Validity** | Valid and binding upon minor |
| **Repudiation** | Cannot be repudiated UNLESS father/grandfather acted to minor's manifest disadvantage |

##### Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939 (Section 2(vii))

A wife is entitled to dissolution if she proves:
- ✅ She was given in marriage by father or other guardian
- ✅ Marriage has **not been consummated**
- ✅ Marriage took place **before she attained 15 years**
- ✅ She has repudiated **before attaining 18 years**

##### When Marriage is by Other Guardian

##### When Option of Puberty is Exercised

| By | When | Condition |
|----|------|-----------|
| **Wife** | Immediately on attaining puberty | After being informed of marriage and right to repudiate |
| **Husband** | At any time before ratification | Before payment of dower OR cohabitation (otherwise right lost) |

---

#### 4. 🚫 Absence of Impediments

> 📌 **Exam Tip**: Impediments are crucial - they determine if marriage is void (batil) or invalid (fasid).

The third essential requires **no impediments or prohibitions**. Impediments are of two kinds:

| Type | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Absolute Impediments** | Make marriage **void (batil)** |
| **Relative Impediments** | Make marriage **invalid/irregular (fasid)** |

> 📖 See detailed section on [Impediments to Marriage](#-impediments-to-marriage) below.

#### 5. 📋 Formalities

##### Customary Practices (Not Essential)

- ✅ Nikah read by **Kazi** (marriage sermon from Quran and Hadis)
- ✅ Exchange of gifts
- ✅ Prayers by guests
- ✅ Additional Maulvis present

> ⚠️ **Important**: These are **customary practices**, NOT essential legal requirements.

##### Registration

- ❌ **Registration is NOT compulsory**
- ⚠️ May cause difficulties later in proving the marriage

| Relationship | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| **Woman suckling** | Foster mother of child |
| **Her husband** | Foster father of child |

**Principle**: Act of suckling = Act of procreation

> ⚠️ **Effect**: Marriage prohibited by fosterage is **totally void** (same as consanguinity/affinity).

| **Marriage with woman in iddat** | ⚠️ **Irregular** (not void) |

---

## ⚖️ Difference Between Void (Batil) and Invalid (Fasid)

> 📌 **Exam Tip**: This distinction is crucial. Always mention: Batil = no rights at all; Fasid = some rights after consummation.

### 📊 Three Kinds of Marriages

---

## 💔 Talaq (Divorce)

> 📌 **Exam Tip**: Talaq is a major topic. Remember: Talaq-ul-Sunnat (revocable) vs Talaq-ul-Bidaat (irrevocable). Triple Talaq is now banned.

### 📊 Nature and Kinds of Talaq

#### Superior Right of Husband

---

### 📖 Meaning of Talaq

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Religious View** | Sin which is unforgivable in eyes of Allah |
| **Quranic Position** | Allah discourages divorce, encourages continuation of marriage |
| **Exception** | If disputes cannot be resolved, Quran provides procedure for dissolution |
| **Revocation** | Procedure allows possibility of revocation |

---

### ✅ Talaq-ul-Sunnat

> 📌 **Exam Tip**: This is the most approved form. Remember: Ahsan (best) and Hasan (proper).

#### Overview

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Basis** | Prophet's tradition (Sunna) |
| **Status** | Most approved form of Talaq |
| **Feature** | Possibility of revoking effects |
| **Also Called** | Revocable Talaq |
| **Recognition** | Both Sunnis and Shias |

> 🧠 **Remember**: Only this kind was in practice during Prophet's life.

---

#### 📋 Talaq-Ahsan (Most Proper)

> 📌 **Exam Tip**: Ahsan is the BEST form. Remember: Single pronouncement + no revocation during iddat.

##### Why It's Most Proper

1. ✅ Possibility of revocation before expiry of iddat period
2. ✅ Evil words of Talaq uttered only **once**

##### Formalities Required

| Step | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **(a) Pronouncement** | Single pronouncement during **Tuhr** (period of purity) |
| **(b) Iddat** | Wife observes iddat of **3 monthly courses** (or until delivery if pregnant) |
| **(c) No Revocation** | No revocation by husband during iddat period |

##### Important Points

- **Tuhr**: Period of wife's purity (between two menstruations)
- **Exception**: If woman not subject to menstruation (old age/pregnancy), Talaq may be pronounced any time
- **Revocation**: May be express OR implied (cohabitation = implied revocation)
- **Effect of Cohabitation**: If husband cohabits even once during iddat, Talaq is **revoked**
- **Finality**: When iddat expires without revocation, Talaq becomes **irrevocable and final**

---

#### 📋 Talaq Hasan (Proper)

##### Overview

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Status** | Proper and approved form |
| **Feature** | Provision for revocation |
| **Difference from Ahsan** | Evil words pronounced **3 times** in successive Tuhrs |

##### Formalities Required

| Step | Requirement |

| **(a) First Pronouncement** | Single declaration in period of Tuhr |
| **(b) Second Pronouncement** | Single pronouncement in **next Tuhr** |
| **(c) Third Pronouncement** | Single pronouncement in **third Tuhr** |

##### Important Points

- ✅ First and second pronouncements may be **revoked** (expressly or by resuming conjugal relations)
- ✅ If revoked, words become ineffective (as if no Talaq made)
- ✅ If no revocation after first/second, third pronouncement makes Talaq **irrevocable**
- ✅ After third pronouncement, marriage dissolves and wife observes iddat

---

### ❌ Talaq-ul-Bidaat (Irrevocable)

> 📌 **Exam Tip**: This is disapproved. Remember: Becomes effective immediately, no possibility of reconciliation.

#### Overview

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Also Called** | Talaq-ul-Bain |
| **Status** | **Disapproved mode** of divorce |
| **Feature** | Becomes effective immediately; **no possibility of reconciliation** |
| **Prophet's View** | Never approved Talaq without opportunity for reconciliation |

---

#### Methods

A Sunni husband may divorce irrevocably in:

##### (a) Triple Pronouncement in One Tuhr

- **Method**: "I divorce thee, I divorce thee, I divorce thee" (three times in one Tuhr)
- **Alternative**: "I divorce thee thrice" OR "I pronounce my first, second and third Talaq"

##### (b) Single Declaration Expressing Irrevocable Intention

- **Method**: "I divorce thee irrevocably" OR "I divorce thee in Bain"

2. No consummation for **4 months**

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Effect** | Does NOT operate as divorce without court order |
| **After 4 Months** | Wife entitled for **judicial divorce** |
