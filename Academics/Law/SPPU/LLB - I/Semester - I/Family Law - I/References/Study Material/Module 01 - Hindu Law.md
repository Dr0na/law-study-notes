## ⚖️ Nature of Hindu Law

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam:** Understanding the nature of Hindu Law helps you distinguish it from modern statutory law. Questions often ask about its divine origin, relationship with Dharma, and the codification process.

### 📌 Definition

Hindu Law is **not law as understood in modern times**. It is:
- ❌ **Not passed by any legislature**
- ✅ **Supposed to be of divine origin**
- ✅ **Derived from the Vedas** (revelations of God)
- ✅ **A branch of Dharma** (duties and rules of conduct)

### 📝 Key Characteristics

According to **Manusmriti**, Hindu Law is:
> "What is followed by those learned in the Vedas, and what is approved by the conscience of the virtuous, which are exempt from hatred and inordinate affection."

### 🔄 Evolution

| Aspect | Traditional View | Modern View |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| **Nature** | Set of rules in Sanskrit books | Large portion now codified |
| **Authority** | Books of authority on law | Acts of Parliament |
| **Application** | Governed by ancient texts | Governed by codified Acts |

---

### 📦 Mixture of Codified and Un-codified Law

> 📌 **Exam Tip:** Always mention that Hindu Law is a **mixture** of codified and uncodified law. The codified portion takes precedence.

#### ✅ Codified Law (Four Main Acts)

1. **The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955**
2. **The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956**
3. **The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956**
4. **The Hindu Succession Act, 1956**

> ⚠️ **Important:** After codification, any point dealt with by the codified law is **final** and overrides all prior law (custom or otherwise), unless an express saving is provided.

#### 📖 Uncodified Law

- Applies to matters **not specifically covered** by codified law
- Old textual law continues to have application
- Includes customs, traditions, and ancient texts

---

## 👥 Application of Hindu Law

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam:** This is a **highly examinable topic**. Questions frequently test who is a Hindu, converts/reconverts, and exceptions. Section 2 of various Hindu Law Acts is commonly asked.

### 📊 Three Categories of Hindus

| Category | Description | Key Points |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **1. Hindu by Religion** | Originally Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, Buddhists | Includes converts and reconverts |
| **2. Hindu by Birth** | Child of Hindu parents | One parent Hindu + brought up as Hindu |
| **3. Not Muslim/Christian/Parsi/Jew** | Any person not governed by other law | Presumed to be Hindu unless proved otherwise |

---

### 🔄 Converts and Reconverts to Hinduism

> 📌 **Exam Tip:** Always cite these two landmark cases when discussing conversion to Hinduism.

#### 📜 Case Laws

| Case | Court | Principle |
|------|-------|-----------|
| **Peerumal v Poonuswami (1971)** | Supreme Court | A person can be a Hindu if after expressing intention of becoming a Hindu, follows the customs of the caste/tribe/community, and the community accepts him |
| **Mohandas vs. Dewaswan Board (1975)** | Kerala HC | Mere declaration and actions are enough for becoming a Hindu |

#### ✅ Requirements for Conversion

- ➜ Expression of intention to become a Hindu
- ➜ Following customs of the caste/tribe/community
- ➜ Acceptance by the community
- ➜ (Alternative view) Mere declaration and actions sufficient

---

### 📜 Under the Codified Law

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam:** Section 2 of Hindu Marriage Act 1955 (and similar provisions in other Acts) is **frequently asked**. Know all sub-sections, explanations, and exceptions.

**Section 2** of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955 provides that the Act applies to the persons listed below (similar provisions are also made in the other enactments of Hindu Law).

---

#### Section 2(1) - Application of Act

This Act applies to:

##### a) Hindus by Religion

To any person who is Hindu by religion in any of its forms of development, including:
- ✅ Virashaiva
- ✅ Lingayat
- ✅ Follower of the Brahmo, Prarthana or Arya Samaj

##### b) Buddhists, Jainas and Sikhs

To any person who is a **Buddhist, Jaina or Sikh by religion**.

##### c) Other Persons

To any other person domiciled in the territories to which this Act extends, who is **not a Muslim, Christian, Parsi or Jew by religion**, unless it is proved that any such person would not have been governed by the Hindu law or by any custom or usage as part of that law in respect of any of the matters dealt with herein if this Act had not been passed.

> ⚠️ **Important:** The burden of proof lies on the person claiming that Hindu law would not have applied.

---

#### Explanation to Section 2(1)

The following persons are Hindus, Buddhists, Jainas or Sikhs by religion, as the case may be:

##### a) Children of Hindu Parents

Any child, **legitimate or illegitimate**, both of whose parents are Hindus, Buddhists, Jains or Sikhs by religion.

##### b) Children of Mixed Parentage

Any child, **legitimate or illegitimate**, one of whose parents is a Hindu, Buddhist, Jaina or Sikh by religion, and who is **brought up as a member** of the tribe, community, group or family to which such parent belongs or belonged.

> 📌 **Exam Tip:** For mixed parentage, the key requirement is "brought up as a member" - not just having one Hindu parent.

##### c) Converts and Re-converts

Any person who is a **convert or re-convert** to the Hindu, Buddhist, Jain or Sikh religion.

---

#### Section 2(2) - Exception: Scheduled Tribes

> ⚠️ **Important Exception:** This is a common exam question.

**Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1)**, nothing contained in this Act shall apply to the members of any **Scheduled Tribes** within the meaning of clause (25) of Article 366 of the Constitution, **unless the Central Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, otherwise directs**.

> 📌 **Exam Tip:** Remember - Scheduled Tribes are **excluded by default**, but the Central Government can include them by notification.

---

#### Section 2(3) - Interpretation of "Hindu"

The expression "Hindu" in any portion of this Act shall be construed as if it included a person who, though **not a Hindu by religion**, is nevertheless, a person to whom this Act applies by virtue of the provisions contained in this section.

> 📌 **Exam Tip:** This is a **deeming provision** - it expands the definition of "Hindu" to include all persons covered by Section 2(1).

---

### 📖 Person to Whom Hindu Law Applies (Uncodified Law)

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam:** Under uncodified law, the scope is broader. Questions may ask about specific categories like illegitimate children, Brahmos, or reconverts.

Under the uncodified Hindu law, the following persons are governed by Hindu law:

#### ✅ Checklist: Categories Covered

## 📖 Sources of Hindu Law

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam:** Sources of law is a **fundamental topic**. Questions often ask about the hierarchy, difference between ancient and modern sources, and the importance of customs. Case laws on custom are frequently tested.

### 📌 Definition of "Source of Law"

The phrase "source of law" has several connotations:

- **Authority** - which issues rules of conduct recognized by Courts as binding
- **The maker of law**
- **Social conditions** - which inspire the making of law for governance
- **'Cause of law'** - the material from which the rules and laws are known
- **'Evidence of law'** - it is in this sense that the expression 'source of law' is accepted in Jurisprudence

### ⚠️ Importance of Sources

> 📌 **Key Principle:** In every personal legal system, only that rule is law which has place in its sources. A rule not laid down or not recognized in the sources is **not a rule** in that legal system.

---

### 🏛️ Ancient Sources

> 📌 **Exam Tip:** Remember the hierarchy: Sruti > Smriti > Commentaries > Custom. Questions often test this order of precedence.

#### 📊 Overview

| Source | Nature | Authority |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Sruti** | Divine revelation | Highest authority |
| **Smriti** | Remembered texts | Secondary to Sruti |
| **Digests and Commentaries** | Interpretations | Varies by region |
| **Puranas** | Illustrative codes | Supporting authority |
| **Custom** | Long-standing practice | Can override texts |

---

### 📜 Sruti

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam:** Sruti is the highest source. Questions may ask about its nature, contents, and relationship with other sources.

#### 📌 Definition

- **Derived from:** Root "sru" which means "to hear"
- **Literal meaning:** "What is heard"
- **Nature:** Believed to contain the very words of God
- **Origin:** Rishis and munis reached the height of spirituality where they were revealed the knowledge of Vedas

#### 📚 Contents

Srutis include the **four Vedas** along with their brahmanas:

1. **Rig Veda**
2. **Yajur Veda**
3. **Sam Veda**
4. **Atharva Veda**

**Brahmanas** are like appendices to the Vedas.

#### 📝 Key Points

- Vedas primarily contain theories about:
  - ✅ Sacrifices
  - ✅ Rituals
  - ✅ Customs

- **Debate:** Some believe Vedas contain no specific laws, while others believe laws have to be inferred from the complete text

- **Authority:** Srutis are believed to be the **ultimate sources of law**, in the sense of rules of human conduct

---

### 📝 Smriti

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam:** Smriti is frequently tested. Questions ask about its relationship with Sruti, notable Smriti writers, and the three categories of rules.

#### 📌 Definition

- **Literal meaning:** "That which was remembered"
- **Nature:** Both Sruti and Smriti refer to utterances and precepts of God
- **Transmission:** Heard and remembered respectively, and handed down by Rishis (sages) from generation to generation

#### 🔄 Relationship with Sruti

Traditionally, Smritis contain:
- Those portions of the Srutis which the sages forgot in their original form
- The idea whereby they wrote in their own language with the help of their memory

> ⚠️ **Important:** The basis of the Smritis is Srutis but they are **human works**.

#### 📚 Notable Smriti Writers

Enumerated by **Yajnavalkya** (sage from Mithila and a major figure in the Upanishads):

| Category | Sanskrit | Meaning | Application |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Achar** | अचार | Relating to morality | Moral conduct |
| **Vyavahar** | व्यवहार | Procedural and applied rules | Settling disputes in substantive rules; King or State adjudication of justice |
| **Prayaschit** | प्रायश्चित | Penal provision | Commission of a wrong |

#### 📜 Case Law

| Case | Principle |
|------|-----------|
| **Shyam Sunder Prasad Singh V. State of Bihar (1980) Supp. S.C.C. 720** | If there is divergence of opinion among the Smritis, the court should consult the prevailing practice among the people. If there is a clear usage to the contrary, the Smriti must yield to such usage. |

> 📌 **Exam Tip:** This case establishes that **custom/usage can override Smriti** when there is divergence.

---

### 📚 Digests and Commentaries

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam:** Commentaries gave rise to different schools of Hindu Law. Questions often test the relationship between commentaries and schools.

#### 📌 Definition

- **Commentaries (Tika or Bhashya)** and **Digests (Nibandhs)** covered a period of more than thousand years
- **Cause:** All the Smritis did not agree with one another in all respects, leading to several interpretations

#### 🔄 Development

- **Nibandhas** = Interpretations put on the Smritis by various commentators
- **Important point:** Commentators did not merely interpret the Smriti, but also recited the customs and usages prevailing among them
- **Result:** While professing to interpret ideas laid down in the Smriti, commentators introduced modifications to bring it into harmony with current usages

#### 📚 Notable Commentaries and Digests

| Work | Author | Significance |
|------|--------|--------------|
| **Manubhashya** | Various | Commentary on Manusmriti |
| **Manutika** | Various | Commentary on Manusmriti |
| **Mitakshara** | Vijnaneshwar | Running commentary on Yajnavalka smriti; basis of Mitakshara School |
| **Dayabhag** | Jimutvahan | Most important digest; applicable in Bengal and Assam; basis of Dayabhaga School |

#### 🏫 Schools of Law

The authority of the several commentators varied in different parts of India, giving rise to what are known as the different **schools of Hindu Law**.

**Two Main Schools:**
- ✅ **The Mitakshara School**
- ✅ **The Dayabhaga School**

---

### 📖 Puranas

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam:** Puranas are a supporting source. Questions rarely focus on them, but you should know they illustrate law by instances.

#### 📌 Definition

The Puranas are also a source of Hindu Law. They are **codes which illustrate the law by instances of its application**.

> 📌 **Exam Tip:** Puranas are illustrative - they show how law is applied through examples.

---

### ⚖️ Custom

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam:** Custom is **highly examinable**. Questions frequently test essentials of valid custom, kinds of custom, and proof of custom. Case laws are commonly asked.

#### 📌 Definition

- **Sanskrit equivalent:** **Sadachara** = "the approved usage" or "the usage of the virtuous man"
- **Nature:** A habitual course of conduct generally observed in a community
- **Legal effect:** A rule which, as a result of very long usage, has obtained the force of law in a particular community or in a particular district

#### 📊 Kinds of Custom

| **6. Not opposed to any law** | Must not conflict with statutory law | Cannot override legislation |

> 📌 **Exam Tip:** Use the mnemonic **"ACRON"** - Ancient, Certain, Reasonable, Ongoing (continuous), Not against public policy/law.

---

#### 📜 Proof of Custom

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam:** Questions often test who has the burden of proof and what evidence is acceptable.

##### 📌 General Rule

- **Burden of proof:** On the person who alleges the custom
- **Method:** Usually, customs are proved by **instances**

##### 📜 Case Laws

| Case | Principle |
|------|-----------|

---

### 🏛️ Modern Sources

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam:** Modern sources are frequently tested, especially justice, equity and good conscience, and the role of precedents. Case laws are important.

---

### ⚖️ Justice, Equity and Good Conscience

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam:** This is a common exam topic. Questions test when it applies and cite the Kenchava case.

#### 📌 Definition

- **Equity** = Fairness in dealing
- **Nature:** Basic values, norms and standards of fair play and propriety
- **Alternative name:** Also termed as **Natural law**

#### 🔄 When Applied

- ➜ When **no rule is given** in any of the sources available
- ➜ When a dispute cannot be settled by application of any existing rule
- ➜ Courts are **under an obligation** to decide such cases

#### 📜 Historical Development

- **18th century:** British administration made it clear that in the absence of a rule, the above principle shall be applied
- **Status:** This principle has enjoyed the status of a source of law since the 18th century

#### 📜 Case Law

| Case | Principle | Significance |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **Kenchava V. Girimalappa (1924)** | A murderer was disqualified from succeeding to the property of the victim | Rule of English law founded on public policy was applied to a Hindu on grounds of justice, equity and good conscience. Now statutorily recognized in the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. |

> 📌 **Exam Tip:** This case shows how English law principles were incorporated into Hindu Law through justice, equity and good conscience.

---

### 📊 Precedent/Judicial Decisions

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam:** The role of precedents in developing Hindu Law is important. Questions test the hierarchy of courts and binding nature of decisions.

#### 📌 Historical Development

- **After British rule:** Hierarchy of Courts was established
- **Doctrine:** Precedent based on the principle of treating like cases alike was established
- **Application:** Courts had to ascertain and administer the personal law of the Hindus in various matters (marriage, adoption, succession, etc.)

#### 🔄 Role of Precedents

- **Filling gaps:** Commentaries are often silent on several points; judges filled in these blanks whilst deciding cases
- **Necessity:** As a result of British rule in India, judicial precedents became necessary and useful guides
- **Modern practice:** Today no lawyer refers to the original text of Hindu law - all requirements are found in Law Reports

#### 📊 Impact

- **Progress:** The progress that Hindu law has made in the 19th and 20th centuries is entirely due to the rulings of the courts
- **Supersession:** Decisions of Courts have often superseded the Commentaries
- **Binding force:** As precedents, these decisions have a binding force

#### ⚖️ Hierarchy of Courts

| Court | Binding Effect |
|-------|----------------|
| **Supreme Court** | Binding on all courts across India (except itself) |
| **High Court** | Binding on all courts in that state, except where modified by Supreme Court |

> 📌 **Exam Tip:** Remember - Supreme Court decisions are binding on all courts except itself (can overrule its own decisions).

---

### 📜 Legislation

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam:** The codification process and its impact is frequently tested. Know the important dates and amendments.

#### 📌 Definition

- **Nature:** Acts of Parliament
- **Role:** Playing a profound role in the formation of Hindu law
- **Development:** After India achieved independence, some important aspects of Hindu Law have been codified

#### ⚠️ Legal Effect

- **After codification:** Any point dealt with by the codified law is **final**
- **Override:** The enactment overrides all prior law, whether based on custom or otherwise, **unless an express saving is provided** for in the enactment itself
- **Uncodified matters:** In matters not specifically covered by the codified law, the old textual law continues to have application

#### 📅 Historical Development

- **1941:** Hindu Law Committee appointed, recommended that this branch of the law should be codified in gradual stages
- **1955-1956:** Most important enactments came
- **Amendments:** 1976, 1994 (Maharashtra State), and 2005

#### ✅ Key Acts

1. **The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955**
2. **The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956**
3. **The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956**
4. **The Hindu Succession Act, 1956**

> 📌 **Exam Tip:** Remember the principle - codified law overrides all prior law (custom or otherwise) unless expressly saved.

---

## 🏫 Schools of Hindu Law

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam:** This is a **highly examinable topic**. Questions frequently test differences between Mitakshara and Dayabhaga, sub-schools of Mitakshara, and the effect of migration. This is fundamental knowledge.

### 📌 Origin of Schools

- **Cause:** Hindu scriptures were not uniformly interpreted by Hindu scholars
- **Result:** Diverging opinions on the interpretations of particular text
- **Terminology:** **Colebrook**, the European scholar of Hindu law, spoke of this divergence as representing schools of Hindu Law

#### 🔄 Development Process

1. Works received universally became subject of subsequent commentaries
2. Commentator put his own gloss on the ancient text
3. Authority received in one part and rejected in another part of India
4. **Result:** Formation of schools

---

### 📘 Mitakshara School

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam:** Mitakshara is the most important school. Questions test its nature, author, area of application, and sub-schools.

#### 📌 Definition

- **Literal meaning:** "A concise work"
- **Nature:** A running commentary on the code of **Yajnavalka smriti**
- **Author:** **Vijnaneshwar** (eleventh century jurist)
- **Area:** Prevails in **all parts of India except Bengal**
- **Type:** **Orthodox school** of Hindu law

#### 📊 Sub-Schools

Mitakshara is subdivided into **four schools** prevailing in different parts of India. These different schools have the same fundamental principles, but differ in matters of details, especially with reference to the topics of **adoption and inheritance**.

| Name of School | Area of Application |
|:---------------|:-------------------|
| **The Banaras School** | Northern India |
| **The Mithila School** | Bihar |
| **The Dravida or Madras School** | Southern India |
| **The Maharashtra or Bombay School** | Western India |

> 📌 **Exam Tip:** Remember the four sub-schools and their areas. Questions often test this.

---

### 📗 Dayabhaga School

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam:** Dayabhaga is frequently compared with Mitakshara. Questions test differences, especially in inheritance and joint family matters.

#### 📌 Definition

- **Area:** Followed mainly in **Bengal**
- **Nature:** Not a commentary on any particular code, but is a **digest of all the codes**
- **Author:** **Jimutavahana** (lived sometime in the twelfth century)
- **Type:** **Reformist School** of Hindu law
- **Sub-schools:** Not divided into any sub-schools

#### ⚠️ Key Characteristics

- **On matters where Dayabhaga is silent:** Mitakshara School will prevail
- **Main difference:** Mitakshara and Dayabhaga Schools differed on important issues as regards the rules of inheritance
- **Codification impact:** This branch of the law is now codified by the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, which has dissolved the differences between the two
- **2005 Amendment:** The main divergence between the two in matters connected with the joint family system has now been diluted further after the 2005 Amendment of the Hindu Succession Act, which has abolished the gender inequality which existed prior to the said amendment

> 📌 **Exam Tip:** Remember - Dayabhaga is a digest (not commentary), reformist (not orthodox), and applies mainly in Bengal.

---

### 🔄 Effect of Migration

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam:** Migration questions test whether a family carries its personal law or adopts the law of the new state.

#### 📌 General Rule

When a Hindu Family migrates from one state to another state, the law draws a **presumption** that it carries with it its **personal law**, i.e. the laws and customs prevailing in the State from which it came.

#### 🔄 Rebuttal of Presumption

The presumption can, however, be **rebutted**, by showing that such a family has **adopted the law and usages** of the new state where it has settled down.

#### ✅ Checklist: Migration Rules

- [x] **Presumption:** Family carries personal law from original state
- [x] **Rebuttable:** Can be rebutted by showing adoption of new state's law
- [x] **Evidence:** Must show actual adoption of law and usages of new state

> 📌 **Exam Tip:** Remember - presumption is in favor of carrying original law, but it can be rebutted by evidence of adoption.
