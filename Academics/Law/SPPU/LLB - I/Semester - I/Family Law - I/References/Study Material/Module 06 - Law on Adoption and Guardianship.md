## ⚖️ Part I: Adoption

### 📖 Adoption Under Hindu Law

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam**: Understanding the concept and objects of adoption is fundamental. Questions often test the distinction between adoption and guardianship, and the legal effects of adoption.

#### 📌 Definition

**Adoption** is a process by which a person takes someone into custody and all the legal rights of a legitimate biological child are transferred to him/her.

- **Legal affiliation of a child**
- Relationship of the child is **severed legally** from biological parents
- Child becomes the **lawful child** of adoptive parents
- All rights, privileges, and responsibilities post-adoption are **similar to a biological child**

#### 🎯 Objects of Adoption

| Object | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Religious** | Offers an heir to the adopter who can fulfill funeral obligations |
| **Secular** | To secure an heir and perpetuate the adopter's name |

> 🧠 **Memory Aid**: Adoption = **R**eligious + **S**ecular objects = **R**ituals + **S**uccession

---

### 📜 The Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam**: This Act codifies Hindu adoption law. Questions frequently test compliance with statutory provisions and consequences of void adoptions.

#### 📋 Section 5: Adoptions to be Regulated by this Chapter

**Sub-section (1)**
- No adoption shall be made after the commencement of this Act by or to a Hindu **except in accordance** with the provisions of this Chapter
- Any adoption made in **contravention** shall be **void**

**Sub-section (2)**
- A void adoption shall **neither**:
  - Create any rights in the adoptive family in favour of any person
  - Destroy the rights of any person in the family of birth

> ⚠️ **Important**: All adoptions by Hindus must comply with this Act. Non-compliance = void adoption with no legal effect.

---

### ✅ Essentials of Valid Adoption (Section 6)

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam**: This is a **must-know** section. Questions often ask to list or explain the four requisites. Missing any one makes adoption invalid.

#### 📋 Four Requisites (All Must Be Present)

1. ✅ **Person adopting** has:
   - Capacity to take in adoption
   - Right to take in adoption

2. ✅ **Person giving in adoption** has:
   - Capacity to do so

3. ✅ **Person adopted** is:
   - Capable of being taken in adoption

4. ✅ **Adoption is made** in:

#### 📋 Multiple Wives

- If person has **more than one wife** living at the time of adoption:

> ⚠️ **Important**: Condition (vi) is crucial—mere agreement is not enough; actual giving and taking required.

---

### ⚡ Effect of Adoption (Section 12)

---

### 👨‍👩‍👧 Natural Guardians
