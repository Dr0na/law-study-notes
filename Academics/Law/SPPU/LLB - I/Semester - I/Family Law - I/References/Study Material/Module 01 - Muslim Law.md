> — **SYED AMEER ALI**

### 📜 Development of Mohammedan Law in India

#### Historical Timeline

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pre-British Era** | Mughal Emperors (Hanafis) administered Hanafi law throughout India |
| **British Rule** | Applied Mohammedan law as personal law to Muslims according to their school |
| **Modern Era** | Shariat Act, 1937 made Muslim personal law uniform across India |

#### Key Changes During British Rule

**Abolished:**
- ✅ Banning of slavery
- ✅ Forfeiture of rights on apostasy

**Altered:**
- ✅ Customary laws modified to restore original Islamic law
- ✅ Wakf Act, 1913 enacted

#### Current Status

**Uniform Application:**
- ✅ Marriage, Divorce, Dower, Legitimacy
- ✅ Guardianship, Wakf, Wills, Gift, Inheritance

> 🧠 **Remember:** Muslim Law in India = Shariat + English Common Law + Equity Principles

---

### 📋 Application of Muslim Law

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam:** Questions frequently test who Muslim law applies to and in which matters. Always distinguish between personal law matters and territorial laws.

#### Key Characteristics

- **Personal Law** (not territorial)
- Applies only to **Muslims** (by birth or conversion)
- Does NOT apply to all persons in a state/country

| **Sufficient Condition** | Profession alone is enough (no particular rites/ceremonies required) |
| **Status** | Born Muslim remains Muslim until unequivocal renunciation |

##### Important Points

- ✅ Illegitimate son of Hindu by Muslim woman, raised as Hindu = may be regarded as Hindu

> 🧠 **Memory Aid:** Muslim = Profession of faith (Shahada) = "One God, One Prophet"

---

---

##### Important Case Laws

| Case | Principle |

> 📌 **Exam Tip:** Always check if both parties are Muslims before applying Shariat Act.

> 🧠 **Memory Aid:** Section 2 = Must apply, Section 3 = May apply (if declared)

---

#### Section 4 and Section 6

| Section | Provision |
|---------|-----------|
| **Section 4** | Empowers state governments to make rules to carry out the Act |
| **Section 6** | Repeals certain Acts to the extent they permit inconsistent customs |

---

### 🔄 Effect of Apostacy (Conversion) from Islam

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam:** Questions often test the effect of conversion on marriage and succession. Remember: husband's conversion dissolves marriage, but wife's conversion has different rules.

---

#### 📊 Effect on Succession

##### Key Principle

**Freedom of Religion Act, 1850:**
- ✅ Convert from Islam **does NOT lose** right of inheritance
- ❌ Hindu **cannot succeed** to estate of Muslim

##### Example Scenario

**Facts:**
- Hindu with Hindu wife and children
- Converts to Islam
- Marries Muslim wife
- Dies

**Result:**
- ✅ Property passes to **Muslim wife**
- ❌ **NOT** to Hindu wife and children

> 📌 **Exam Tip:** Always mention Freedom of Religion Act, 1850 when discussing apostasy and succession.

---

#### 💔 Effect on Marriage

##### Husband's Conversion

| Situation | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Muslim husband renounces Islam** | Marriage dissolved **ipso facto** (automatically) |

##### Wife's Conversion

| Situation | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Muslim wife (born Muslim) converts to Christianity** | Marriage **NOT dissolved** by mere conversion |
| **Wife converted to Islam from other faith, then re-embraces former faith** | Marriage **dissolved** |

> 🧠 **Memory Aid:** Husband converts = marriage ends. Wife converts = depends on whether she was born Muslim or converted.

---

### 🔄 Effect of Conversion to Islam

> 📌 **Why this matters in exam:** Questions test whether conversion allows polygamy, changes succession rules, etc. Always check if conversion is bonafide or colorable.

#### General Principle

On conversion to Islam:
- ✅ Convert **renounces** former religion and personal law
- ✅ **Substitutes** Muslim religion and personal law
- ✅ Applies to **all converts**, regardless of previous religion

---

#### Effects on Different Matters

| Matter | Effect of Conversion |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Marriage** | Indian Christian can contract **second marriage** with Muslim woman while Christian marriage subsists |
| **Divorce** | Muslim married Christian woman in Christian form. Wife converts to Islam. Husband divorces by Talak = **Valid** |
| **Succession** | Property of convert devolves according to **Muslim law** (not Indian Succession Act) |
| **Property** | Hindu convert's property devolves according to **Muslim law** |

---

#### ⚠️ Important Condition

**Conversion must be BONAFIDE:**
- ✅ Genuine conversion
- ❌ **NOT** colorable (sole purpose of evading personal law)
