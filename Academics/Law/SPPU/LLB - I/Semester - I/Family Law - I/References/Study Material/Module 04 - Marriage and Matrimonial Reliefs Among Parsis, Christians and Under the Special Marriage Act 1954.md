## ⚠️ Common Exam Pitfalls

1. **Confusing witness requirements**: Christian Act = 2, Special Marriage Act = 3
2. **Age at registration**: For registration of existing marriages, both parties must be 21 (not 18 for female)
3. **Sec. 21-A exception**: Only applies when BOTH parties are Hindu/Buddhist/Sikh/Jain
4. **Mental capacity**: Special Marriage Act has three specific categories; Christian Act has general requirement
5. **Prohibited relationship**: Custom exception applies only if at least one party is governed by such custom
6. **Effect of registration**: Children become legitimate from date of ceremony, not date of registration
7. **Severance from HUF**: Only applies to Hindu/Buddhist/Sikh/Jain members of undivided families

## 📚 Exam Tips

1. **Always mention section numbers** when discussing legal provisions
2. **Compare and contrast** the two Acts in comparative questions
3. **Distinguish** between solemnization and registration procedures
4. **Remember time limits** - they are frequently tested
5. **Understand consequences** - especially effect on HUF and succession
6. **Know exceptions** - Sec. 21-A, custom for prohibited relationships
7. **Procedure matters** - questions often test procedural requirements step-by-step
