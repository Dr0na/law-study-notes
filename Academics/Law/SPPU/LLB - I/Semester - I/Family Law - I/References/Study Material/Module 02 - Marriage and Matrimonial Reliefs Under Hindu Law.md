## Unit 1: Marriage

### 1.1 Evolution and Concept of Marriage

> 📌 **Why this matters**: Understanding the conceptual foundation helps in answering questions about the nature and purpose of marriage in Hindu law.

#### 📖 Definition and Purpose

- **Primary Function**: Regulates sexual relationships
- **Key Purpose**: Determines **paternity** of children (if unregulated, only maternity would be known)
- **Legal Effect**: Confers **status** on parties to the marriage

---

### 1.2 Nature and Forms Under Ancient Hindu Law

> 📌 **Why this matters**: Questions often ask about the nature of Hindu marriage (sacrament vs contract) and the eight ancient forms. This is a favorite topic for comparative analysis.

#### ⚖️ Hindu Marriage: A Sacrament or a Civil Contract?

**Hindu Marriage as a Sacrament (Samskara)**

- Marriage is the **last of the ten sacraments** (Samskara)
- Performed to **purify the body** from inherited taint
- More of a **religious necessity** than physical luxury
- Described as: *"the union of flesh with flesh and bone with bone"*
- **Indissoluble union** - as long as husband is alive, wife regards him as her God
- Wife is **Ardhangini** (half the body of husband)
  - Shares equally the fruits of all his acts (good or bad)

**Hindu Marriage as a Contract**

- The ceremony of **Kanyadan** fulfills all requirements of a gift (as per Manu)
- Concept continues even after Hindu Marriage Act, 1955

> ✅ **Key Legal Position**: **Hindu marriage is BOTH a sacrament AND a contract**

**Supporting Case Laws:**
- Purshottamadas v. Purshottamadas
- Bhagwati Saran Singh v. Parmeshwari Nandan Singh
- Muthuswami v. Masilamani
- Anjona Dasi v. Ghose

**(i)** "Sapinda relationship" with reference to any person extends:
- **Third generation (inclusive)** in line of ascent through **mother**
- **Fifth generation (inclusive)** in line of ascent through **father**
- Line traced **upwards** from person concerned
- Person concerned counted as **first generation**

- In both cases, **X is counted as first generation**

---

#### 🧠 Theories of Sapinda Relationship

**Two theories propounded in ancient Hindu Law:**

##### 1. Oblation Theory

- Hindus believe in **ancestor worship**
- Offer **pinda-dan** (rice balls) to departed ancestors during shraddha
- **Rule**: 
  - One full pinda each to paternal ancestors
  - One full pinda each to two maternal ancestors
  - One divided pinda each to three next paternal ancestors
  - One divided pinda each to two next maternal ancestors
- Connected by pinda-dan to:
  - **6 ancestors** on paternal side
  - **4 ancestors** on maternal side
- When two persons offer pindas to **same ancestor**, they are sapindas to each other

##### 2. Particles of the Same Body Theory (Vijnaneshwara)

- Changed meaning of "pinda" from "ball" to **"particles of same body"**
- Sapinda relationship arises from being connected by **particles of one body**
- All those of **same blood** are related
- **Problem**: Too wide - could exist for 10, 20, 100+ generations
- **Solution**: Limited to:
  - **7th degree** on father's side
  - **5th degree** on mother's side

---

### 1.4.7 Ceremonies of Marriage (Section 7)

> 📌 **Why this matters**: Questions test understanding of required ceremonies, saptapadi, and special provisions. Often combined with validity of marriage.

#### 📖 Ceremonies for a Hindu Marriage

**(1)** A Hindu marriage may be solemnized in accordance with **customary rites and ceremonies of either party** thereto.

**(2)** Where such rites and ceremonies include **saptapadi** (taking of seven steps by bridegroom and bride jointly before sacred fire), the marriage becomes **complete and binding when the seventh step is taken**.

---

#### ✅ Key Points

- Act gives **statutory recognition** to Saptapadi
- Saptapadi is **NOT obligatory**
- Ceremony means **customary rites and ceremonies of either party**
- Consists of:
  - **Kanyadan** (formal giving away)
  - **Acceptance of bride** before sacred fire
  - **Recitation of Vedic mantras**
  - **Saptapadi** (seven steps)

---

#### ⚖️ Case Law: Sitabai v. Vithabai (1958 NLJ, 10)

**Principle:**
- Where marriage has in fact taken place, there is **dual presumption**:
  1. All **legal formalities** have been complied with
  2. All **necessary ceremonies** have been performed
- **Burden**: On person challenging validity to **rebut these presumptions**

---

#### 🆕 Innovation of New Ceremonies

> ⚠️ **General Rule**: Ordinarily, **no one** (not even community/organization/movement) is free to alter, vary or create ceremony at pleasure

**Special Acts:**
- Arya Marriage Validation Act, 1937
- Vedic Marriage
- Anand Marriage Act, 1909 (Sikh Marriage)

---

#### ⚖️ Devani v. Chindavaram (AIR 1954 Mad 657)

**Facts:**
- Tamil Nadu: Anti-Purohit Organization / Self-Respectors cult (50+ years)
- Objective: Do away with traditional rites and ceremonies
- Innovated simple rites: **Surya-mariyathai or Seerthiruththa marriages**
- Ceremony: Exchange of garlands and rings in presence of relatives/friends

**Holding:**
- Marriage held **void** - no one can alter personal law

**Result:**
- **Section 7-A** inserted by amendment (came into force 17/1/68)
- Applies **only to marriages in Tamil Nadu**

---

#### ⚖️ S. Naglingam v. Sivagami (2001) 7 SCC 487

**Principle:**
- Mere **execution of document** by spouses that they have become husband and wife, OR
- **Declaration** in presence of friends and other persons
- Will confer status of husband and wife (Section 7-A(1)(a))
- **Presence of priest is NOT necessary**

---

### 1.4.8 Registration of Marriage (Section 8)

> 📌 **Why this matters**: Registration is important for proof of marriage. Questions may test understanding of mandatory vs optional nature and Supreme Court directions.

#### 📖 Registration of Hindu Marriages

**(1)** For purpose of **facilitating proof** of Hindu marriages, State Government may make rules providing that parties may have particulars entered in **Hindu Marriage Register**.

**State Legislation (Example):**
- The Maharashtra Regulation of Marriage Bureaus and Registration of Marriages Act, 1998
- The Maharashtra Regulation of Marriage Bureaus and Registration of Marriages Rules, 1999

---

#### ⚖️ Case Law: Seema v. Ashwani Kumar

**Seema v. Ashwani Kumar (AIR 2006 SC 1158)**
- Registration falls within "**vital statistics**" (Entry 30, List-3, 7th Schedule)
- Marriage of **all citizens** (all religions) should be **compulsorily registrable** in States where solemnized

**Seema v. Ashwani Kumar (2008) 1 SCC 180)**
- Supreme Court directed all States and Union Territories to file **compliance report**
- Granted **3 months** for compliance

---

## Unit 2: Divorce

### 2.1 Theories of Divorce

> 📌 **Why this matters**: Understanding the three theories helps in answering questions about grounds of divorce and their rationale. Often tested in essay questions.

#### 📊 Three Theories Recognized by the Act

| Theory | Rationale | Section | Drawback |
|--------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **1. Fault Theory**<br>(Offences/Guilt Theory) | Marriage dissolved only when either party commits matrimonial wrong<br>Requires guilty party and innocent party<br>Only innocent party can seek divorce | Section 13(1) & 13(2) | If **both parties at fault**, no remedy available |
| **2. Mutual Consent Theory** | Since parties can marry by free will, they should be allowed to dissolve by free will | Section 13-B | Critics: Promotes immorality, leads to hasty divorces |
| **3. Irretrievable Breakdown Theory** | Marriage breakdown = failure in matrimonial relationship with no reasonable probability of spouses living together again<br>Should be dissolved with maximum fairness, minimum bitterness | Section 13(1-A) | - |

---

### 2.2 Grounds of Divorce

> 📌 **Why this matters**: This is the MOST CRITICAL topic. Questions frequently list grounds, ask to explain specific grounds, or analyze whether divorce can be granted. Master Section 13 thoroughly.

### 3.1 Void Marriage (Section 11)

#### 📖 The Law of Nullity

**Concept:**
- Relates to **pre-marriage impediments** to marriage
- Such impediments relate to **capacity to marry**
- If they exist, parties **cannot marry each other**
- Still, if they marry, marriage may not be valid

**Two Types of Impediments:**

| Type | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Absolute Impediments** | Marriage is **void ab initio** |
| **Relative Impediments** | Marriage is **voidable** |

---

#### ❌ Characteristics of Void Marriage

2. **Does not exist from beginning**
3. **No legal consequences** flow from it:
   - No status
   - No rights and obligations
   - No inheritance
   - etc.

#### 📋 Void Marriages (Section 11)

Any marriage solemnized **after commencement of this Act** shall be **null and void** and may be declared so by decree of nullity if it contravenes **any one** of conditions in:

- **Clause (iv)** - Prohibited relationship (Section 5(iv))
- **Clause (v)** - Sapinda relationship (Section 5(v))

- **Judicial declaration**: Even if petition filed, court merely makes **judicial declaration** of existing fact
- **Who can petition**: Petition can only be made by **either party to the marriage**

**Special Case - Bigamy:**
- Where marriage is void because person has taken second wife (first wife alive):
  - **Second wife** can petition under Section 11 (she was party to void marriage)
  - **First wife** has no such right under Section 11
  - **First wife** may bring **declaratory suit** under Section 9 CPC read with Section 34 of Specific Relief Act, 1963

1. **Valid until avoided**: Voidable marriage is **perfectly valid** so long as not avoided
2. **Can be avoided only by party**: Can be avoided only on **petition of one of parties** to marriage
3. **Remains valid if not avoided**: If parties do not petition, marriage **remains valid**
4. **Cannot challenge after death**: If one party dies before annulment, **no one can challenge** marriage

6. **Retrospective effect**: Once challenged and declared void, decree has **retrospective effect** from date of marriage
7. **Deemed never married**: Marriage deemed to have been **void for all purposes from inception**
8. **Children illegitimate**: Parties deemed to have **never been husband and wife**, children deemed **illegitimate**

**(3)** Nothing in sub-section (1) or (2) shall be construed as conferring upon any child of marriage which is null and void or annulled by decree of nullity under Section 12, any **rights in or to property of any person other than parents**, in any case where, but for passing of this Act, such child would have been incapable of possessing or acquiring any such rights by reason of not being legitimate child of parents.
