# Foreign Marriage

## Introduction

Marriage is a common tradition not only in India but all over the world and we all are accustomed to the values of this tradition that holds the culture and family values together. The value of marriage lies in both the religious and non-religious societies across the world. They follow the custom of marriage representing the civilized society of beings. The sanctioned union between two persons would greatly enhance the development and welfare of the people. The **Foreign Marriage Act** abridges the gap between the Indian Nations and the Foreigners by providing a common platform for the solemnization of marriages.

## Objective of the Act

The basic objective of this Act is to **solemnize the marriage between Indian citizens and foreigners**. There are various pre-existing marriage laws in our country but this Act covers the exclusive and exhaustive conditions or various possibilities that can be related to marriage. In other words, they have some special provisions related to marriage which are not mentioned impliedly in other Acts related to personal laws. This Act abridges the gap between the Indian marriage laws and the foreign marriage laws and has some exclusive provisions for the citizens as well as non-citizens.

In India, such marriage laws are governed under the **Foreign Marriage Act, 1969**.

## Importance of This Act in India

The Act plays a very important role as it is a foundational law for the issue related to foreign marriages. India is a culturally diversified and tradition-enriched country where marriage is considered a holy union. The Act provides recognition of marriage irrespective of any tradition, custom, or unreasonable conditions.

The Foreign Marriage Act is completely based on factual situations in addition to certain fulfillment of conditions that are justifiable as to recognize the marriage according to the laws of the country. The Act recognizes the presence of the couple and their consent in which one should strictly be an Indian citizen as mentioned in **Section 4** of Chapter 2 of the Act. This Act has eliminated many flaws that would have created the issue and dilemma among the public. Earlier, there were no dedicated marriage laws related to foreign nationals or marriages of Indians in foreign countries. This kind of dilemma gets solved by this special Act.

> **📌 Case Law: Minoti Anand & Anr vs Subhash Anand & Ors (2011)**
>
> The Bombay High Court held that the marriage was solemnized under Section 18 of the Foreign Marriage Act. The fact was that they were an Indian Hindu couple and the marriage between them was performed in Japan as per the Japanese traditions and customs and it was registered under the Foreign Marriage Act. The major dispute was about the claim of matrimonial relief and the parties were at the dispute that it should come under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 but the Court held that since the marriage is solemnized under the Foreign Marriage Act, the special relief would be claimed under the Special Marriage Act, 1954. Section 18 sub-sections 1 of Chapter 4 accepts the provisions of chapters four to seven of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 and it shall be applied in case of the parties whose marriage was solemnized in foreign countries between parties and one should be the citizen of India.

> **📌 Case Law: Joyce Sumathi vs Robert Dickson Brodie (1982)**
>
> The Andhra High Court held that if the parties marry in a foreign country then the relief can be claimed under Section 18 of the Foreign Marriage Act. The fact is that the wife of the appellant is a resident of India and they resided in Bahrain. As per the facts, the husband deserted the wife and so the wife filed for divorce in the lower court of India. The lower court dismissed the petition on the ground that the marriage is not registered under Section 17 of the Foreign Marriage Act (registration of foreign marriages) but after the appeal in the High Court, it was concluded that marriage solemnized under Section 18 of the Act or any other marriage solemnized in a foreign country should be taken into consideration as a valid marriage, on the condition that one party should be an Indian citizen and so wife's petition to move forward for divorce was held maintainable.

## Critical Analysis

Although the Foreign Marriage Act was formulated with the intent to create special provisions related to the marriage of Indian citizens with foreigners, it has some flaws as well. It is dependent on the provisions of other Acts. There are certainly major issues in the provisions of the Act that were reflected in certain cases as well.

### Major Problems

1. **Silence on Divorce and Remedies**: The major problem is that the Act is silent in the case of divorce, nullity, or any other remedies as these provisions are not specifically stated in the Act. However, these issues have been covered so far in the Special Marriage Act while the marriages are solemnized and registered under the provisions of the Foreign Marriage Act.

> **📌 Case Law: Neerja Saraph vs Jayant Saraph (1994)**
>
> The Hon'ble Supreme Court has issued this issue where the court stated that general rights are available.

2. **Succession Issues**: The Act also fails to address the issue of Succession related to matrimonial relief. The parties for remedies can't use any provisions related to joint family status, inheritance rights of parties to civil marriage, and the succession law applicable to parties and their children found specifically in the Special Marriage Act.

3. **Penalties Only for Indian Citizens**: The penalties are only for citizens of India. The punishment in case of any crimes related to Domestic Violence or any other kind can apply to Indian citizens and it cannot be applied to foreign parties even if they are found guilty of such crimes.

## Problems Related to Foreign Marriage

Certain issues need to be discussed related to foreign marriages. The Non-residential Indians play a significant role in preserving the rich Indian culture, religions, traditions, and languages. In the recent few years, the Overseas Indian Marriages have seen a rapid increase of cases due to various issues.

The common incidents that are related to Overseas Indian marriage are increasing day by day. The increasing problems in overseas marriage are complex in nature as these also fall under the Private International Law and Law of the Foreign Land.

### Instances of the NRI Husband Found to be Already Married

After the marriage when a woman starts to live with her husband in a foreign country she gets to know that her husband has already married a person of her desire but then also he marries again due to family pressure. The woman faces trouble as well as mental trauma due to this issue as her husband is already married as per the laws existing in that foreign country.

> **📌 Case Law: Harmeeta Singh vs Rajat Taneja (102 (2003) DLT 822)**
>
> Under which wife was deserted by her husband within 6 months of marriage as the husband was already married so the Indian court concluded that whatever be the case in the US Court in India he will be guilty of bigamy and also would be liable to face criminal action.

---

## Conclusion

The Foreign Marriage Act has played a significant role in reducing the conflict for the validity of a marriage based on foreign countries. This Act has undoubtedly provided a good platform for the legitimate recognition of marriages as per the laws of the country. It reduced the flaws regarding marriages of nations by providing exclusive points on foreign marriages. The best distinctive feature of this Act is that it covers the conditions irrespective of religion.
