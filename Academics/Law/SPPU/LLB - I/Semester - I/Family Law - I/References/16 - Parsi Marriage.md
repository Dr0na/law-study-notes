# Parsi Marriage

## Introduction

A **"Parsi"** means a Parsi Zoroastrian. Zoroastrian weddings are a religious ceremony in Zoroastrianism in which two individuals, a man and a woman are united. In Zoroastrianism, marriage within the community is encouraged, and is greatly favored in religious texts. Traditionally marriages are arranged by the parents with the consent of the children. In recent times however, it is not uncommon for this system to be reversed, with the parents consulted about a decision made by the marrying parties.

In India, the threshold for marriage is set by the **Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936**. It extends to the whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir.

## Essentials (Sections 3 to 17)

### Conditions for Valid Marriage

#### 2. Ceremony - Ashirvad

Such marriage is not solemnized according to the Parsi form of ceremony called **"Ashirvad"** by a priest in the presence of two Parsi witnesses other than such priest.

> **📌 Case Law: Parshottam v. Meherbai (ILR (1880) 13 Bom 302)**

> In this case it was held that the Parsi marriage is also regarded as a contract though the religious ceremony of Ashirvad is essential for its validity. Its literal meaning is **"blessing"**. Ashirvad means a prayer or exhortation to the parties to observe their marital obligations.
