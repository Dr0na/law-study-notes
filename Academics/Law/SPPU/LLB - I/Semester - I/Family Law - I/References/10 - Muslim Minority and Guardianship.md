# Muslim Minority and Guardianship

## Introduction

**Guardianship** is the lawful entitlement to supervise the movements and acts of a person who is unable to care for himself and handle his own affairs due to mental flaws, such as an infant, an imbecile, or a lunatic.

It includes:

- The ward's **custody** (physical care and control)
- The authority to deal with the ward's **possessions** (property management)

---

## Meaning of Guardianship

The term **'Guardianship' (Wilayat)** in Muslim law specifically connotes the guardianship of a minor.

### Definition of Minor

According to **Section 3 of the Indian Majority Act, 1875**, a person domiciled in the 'Republic of India' who is below the **age of eighteen years** is considered a **minor**.

### Legal Status of Minors

- A **minor** is assumed to have **no capacity** to protect his or her own interests.
- Law requires that some adult person must safeguard the minor's person or property and act on his or her behalf.
- A minor is **legally incompetent** to enter into contracts or make legal decisions.

### Who is a Guardian?

A person who is authorized under the law to guard the **person or property** of a minor is called a **guardian**.

Under Muslim law, guardians are needed for:

1. **Marriage** (guardianship for marriage)
2. **Protecting the minor's person** (custody and care)
3. **Protecting the minor's property** (property management)

## Guardianship under Muslim Law

### Key Concepts

**Guardianship** under Muslim law is known as **'Hizanat'**. However, it is important to note that:

- **Guardianship** and **Hizanat** are often misinterpreted to mean the same thing.
- Under Islamic law, these two components are **distinct** and are governed by **separate laws**.

### Distinction Between Guardianship and Custody (Hizanat)

| Aspect | Guardianship | Custody (Hizanat) |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Definition** | Overall responsibility for the child throughout childhood | Actual physical possession of the child at a given age |
| **Authority** | Complete control over minor's person and property | Right to physical custody only |
| **Holder** | Father or paternal grandfather | Mother (until child reaches certain age) |

### Important Points

1. **Child's Guardianship**: Entails overall responsibility for the child throughout his or her childhood. In the absence of the father or his executor, the minor's natural guardian (the paternal grandfather) is in control of the minor's person.

2. **Custody of the Child**: Merely refers to the child's actual possession (custody) at a given age.

3. **Mother's Right**: Despite the fact that the mother is **not** the child's natural guardian (under Muslim Law), she has a claim to **custody** of the child until the child reaches a certain age. This is referred to as **Hizanat**, which connotes the right of a mother over her children.

4. **Father's Authority**: The father or paternal grandfather, on the other hand, has **entire power** over the minor for the duration of the minority.

## Kinds of Guardian

Under Muslim law, guardians can be classified into the following categories:

1. **Natural or Legal Guardian**
2. **Testamentary Guardian**
3. **Guardian Appointed by Courts** (Statutory Guardian)
4. **De-facto Guardian** (Fizuli) - This concept is out of vogue in modern Muslim law.

## Legal or Natural Guardianship

### Definition of Natural Guardian

- A **natural guardian** has the authority to control and monitor the work of a minor.
- Under all schools of Muslim law, the **father** is acknowledged as the natural guardian of his child.
- A **legal guardian** is also known as a natural guardian.

### When Father is Absent

In the absence of the father, the **executor of the father's will** may act as a legal guardian. The executor could be a person named by the father or grandfather to function as the guardian for his minor child.

### Order of Priority for Natural Guardians

The **natural guardian** of a minor, in order of priority, are as follows:

1. **Father**
2. **Executor of father**
3. **Paternal grandfather**
4. **The executor of Paternal grandfather**

**Important**: Under Muslim law, in the absence of any of the above-mentioned persons, **no one else** can be recognized as the natural guardian of a minor.

### Shia Law - Natural Guardianship

**Special Rule for Shia Law:**

- In the absence of father, **only paternal grandfather** could act as a legal guardian.
- In the presence of paternal grandfather, the **father's executor has no right** to act as legal guardian of a child.

## Disqualifications of Guardianship of Person

### In Case of Mother and Other Female Relation

A mother or other female relation loses the right to custody if:

2. She leads an **immoral life**.
3. She resides during the subsistence of marriage at a **distance** from the father's place of residence.
4. She **converts to another religion**.

### In Case of a Male

A male loses the right to custody if:
