# Divorce under Hindu Law

## Introduction

In divorce the relationship of husband and wife **ceases to exist**. After divorce the original marital status of the parties cannot be restored. Once the decree of divorce is passed, parties to such marriage become entitled to remarry after the lapse of a statutory period. Divorce put an end to conjugal duties of the parties.

## Old Hindu Law

Divorce was **unknown to the laws of the Dharmashastra** as marriage was regarded as an indissoluble union of the husband and wife. But on the other hand we find some texts in Narada and Parashar codes of law, which permit divorce to wife in certain conditions of life.

### According to Narada

There are **5 conditions** in which a woman could renounce her husband and choose another:

1. Husband lost and unheard of for a period of **7 years**
2. Husband is **dead**
3. Husband **renounced the world**
4. Husband became **impotent**
5. Husband is **ex-communicated**

### According to Kautilya's Arthashastra

Dissolution of marriage is permitted in the following cases:

1. Husband's misconduct with the wife
2. Husband's prolonged absence
3. Husband's banishment
4. Husband becoming dangerous to the wife's life
5. Husband ex-communicated
6. Husband having become impotent

## Modern Law - Hindu Marriage Act, 1955

The provisions for divorce in the existing **Hindu Marriage Act, 1955** have radical change in the legal concept of Hindu marriage. The significant situation arising since the Marriage laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 by the creation of identical grounds of divorce and judicial separation.

## Grounds of Divorce under Section 13(1)

### 1. Adultery

- A **single act of voluntary sexual intercourse** with any person other than his or her spouse has been made a ground for divorce
- The term **"living in adultery"** has been replaced by expression **"voluntary sexual intercourse"** by the Marriage laws (Amendment) Act, 1976
- The burden of proving adultery is on the party who alleges it

#### Circumstantial Evidence of Adultery

In absence of direct evidence of adultery, it can be proved by circumstantial evidence as:

- Man and woman stayed in one house together for a long time
- Man/woman had refused to go back to matrimonial home
- Man and woman not coming in witness box to deny charge of adultery
- No reasonable answer to prove why they are living together

> **📌 Veera Reddi v. Kistamma (1969 Mad. 235)**
>
> The wife brought to an end her every relation with the husband on 17/11/1957 and started living with her parents. After 17/11/1957 there was no meeting between them. On 23/12/1958 after 402 days of separation between them wife delivered a child. The Madras High Court held the wife is guilty of adultery.

> **📌 P v. P and R (A.I.R. 1982 Bom. 498)**
>
> It is difficult to produce evidence to prove adultery. In such a situation court may rely on the circumstantial evidence. The circumstantial evidence will consist not only of the two offending parties being found together in unusual circumstances or being together alone in a scheduled place for a long period of time but also will consist of the social conditions of the parties.

> **📌 Vimlakshi v. Smt. Sarojini (AIR 1991 Karn. 128)**
>
> Where the husband had witnessed the adultery but filed the petition for divorce on that ground 8 years later. The court held that divorce cannot be granted because lapse of 8 years can consider as condonation.

### 2. Cruelty

- The word **"Cruelty"** has not been defined in the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955
- It is course of conduct of one which is adversely affecting the other
- Earlier cruelty had to be such which would affect the physical or mental health of other spouse

#### Different Kinds of Cruelty

1. **Actual or threatened physical injury** - It includes danger to life, limb or health (bodily or mental)
2. **Verbal abuse or insults** - It includes things which bring shame and mental agony to other spouse
3. **Excessive sexual intercourse**
4. **Refusal of intercourse**
5. **Neglect by spouse** in the discharge of his/her duties

> **📌 Rajendra Singh v. Taramati (AIR 1980 Del. 213)**
>
> The husband was seriously injured in an accident and was admitted in a hospital. He remained in the hospital for treatment for about 8 months. But the wife did not care to visit him regularly despite the information of his condition. The court held that wife is guilty of cruelty.

6. **Knowingly communicating the venereal disease**
7. **Drunkenness and use of drugs** - If spouse is violently behaving after drinking then it is injurious to health of other spouse and amounts to cruelty
8. **Refusal to speak** may cause worry and anxiety to other spouse
9. **Forcing association/intercourse** with a stranger or improper person
10. **False charge of immorality** against the wife including false complaints of theft, writing letters to superiors containing baseless allegations etc.
11. **Ill-treatment of children** in presence of the spouse
12. **Denies wife the fair opportunity** of having a child or wife is refusing husband's desire for having children
13. **Tearing of Mangalsutra**, beating a child mercilessly, switching on the light at night and sitting by the side of spouse also amounts to cruelty

> **📌 Suman Kapur v. Sudhir Kapur (AIR 2009 SC 589)**
>
> In this case the court observed that, mens rea is not necessary element in cruelty. So, divorce cannot be denied to party on the ground that there was no wilful ill treatment.

> **📌 Ashoka Kumar v. Vijayalakshmi (AIR 1992 Del. 1082)**
>
> In this case wife alleged that her husband sprinkled kerosene oil on her and accordingly attempted to burn her. But it was false allegation. The court held that such false allegations amount to cruelty.

#### Condonation

It means **forgiveness of the matrimonial offence** and the restoration of the offending spouse to the same position as he or she occupied before the offence was committed.

**Condonation = Forgiveness + Restoration**

---

### 3. Desertion

- Desertion is the act of forsaking or abandoning or the act of quitting with an intention not to return
- Desertion for a continuous period of **not less than 2 years** is now good ground for divorce

#### Essential Conditions for Desertion

1. **Separation** - The spouse must have parted or terminated joint living. It also includes separation without desertion and desertion without separation
2. **Intention** - The deserting spouse must have the intention to desert the other spouse
3. **Consent** - The deserted spouse must not have agreed or consented to the separation

>
> In this case husband was pressurised by wife to live separate from his parents. And then she left her matrimonial home and went to her parental home. The court held that the wife is guilty of desertion.

#### Constructive Desertion

If one spouse by words and conduct compels the other to quit the matrimonial home the former will be guilty of desertion. Though the later has physically separated from the other and left the matrimonial home. Constructive desertion in the expression used to show that the spouse who forces the other to leave him or her is guilty of desertion and not the other party.

> **📌 Smt. Sushma v. Niranjan Singh (AIR 1983 Del. 449)**
>
> The wife had gone to her parental home with the consent of her husband and later the husband imputed against her that she had illicit relations with her sister's husband. Under the conditions of such imputation, the wife showed no willingness to return to her husband nor the husband took any interest to keep her with him. The court held the husband guilty of constructive desertion.

### 4. Conversion

- If spouse ceases to be a Hindu by change of religion, the petition for divorce can be granted on this ground
- For Hindu, conversion to another religion means **non-Hindu religion** such as Christianity, Mohammedanism
- Conversion to **Buddhist, Jain or Sikh is not conversion** to another religion because the Act deems Buddhist, Jains and Sikhs to be Hindus

> **📌 Chandra Shekhar v. Kuldan Velu (1963 SC 185)**
>
> Merely ceasing to be a Hindu would not amount to change of religion. It is only when he/she embraces other religion after renunciation of Hinduism that decree of divorce is obtainable on that ground.

---

### 9. Presumptive Death

- If either spouse has not been heard of as being alive for a period of **7 years or more** then it can be presumed by law that such person is dead
- Such presumption can be drawn because if he/she were alive, then they would probably have communicated with some of his friends and relatives

- The Law commission of India in its **71st report, 1978** pointed out:

> "The theoretical basis and necessity for introducing irretrievable breakdown as a ground of divorce is that the marriage has all the external appearance of marriage, but none of the reality. The marriage is merely a 'shell out of which the substance is gone.' In such circumstances, there is hardly any utility in maintaining the marriage, when the emotional and other bonds, which are of essence of marriage, have disappeared."

> **📌 Chandra Kala Trivedi v. Dr. S.P. Trivedi ((1993) 4 SCC 232)**
>
> The court observed that, "If a marriage was dead and there was no chance of its being retrieved it was better to bring it to an end. In this case the marriage is dead both emotionally and practically. Continuance of marital alliance for name-sake is prolonging the agony and afflictions. Yet the marriage being dead, the continuance of it would be of no use."
