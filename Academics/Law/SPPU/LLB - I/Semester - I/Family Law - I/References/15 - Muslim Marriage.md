# Muslim Marriage / Nikah

## Introduction

Muslim Law in India means **"that portion of Islamic Civil Law which is applied to Muslims as a personal law"**. It consists of injunctions of Quran and has been further supplemented and modified by state Legislation and modern judicial precedents of the High Courts and the Supreme Court of India and also of the Privy Council.

**Marriage/'Nikah'** according to Muslim Law are a contract underlying a permanent relationship based on mutual consent.

> **📌 Case Law: Abdul Kadir v. Salima And Anr.**
>
> (J) Mahmood observed nature of Muslim marriage purely as a **civil contract rather than a sacrament**. Based on his observations, we can conclude that the objective of Muslim marriage is to legalize sexual relationship of male and female and also procreation of child. Thus, a valid contract is necessary for Muslim marriage. The essentials of Muslim marriage are very much similar to that of a Civil Contract.

## Features

1. A Muslim marriage requires **proposal (Ijab)** from one party and **acceptance (Qubul)** from the other as is required for a contract. Moreover there can be no marriage without free consent and such consent should not be obtained by means of coercion, fraud or undue influence.

2. Just as in case of contract, entered by a guardian, on attaining majority, so can a marriage contract in Muslim Law, be set aside by a minor on attaining the age of puberty.

3. The parties to a Muslim marriage may enter into any **ante-nuptial or postnuptial agreement** which is enforceable by law provided it is reasonable and not opposed to the policy of Islam. Same is the case with a contract.

4. The terms of a marriage contract may also be altered within legal limits to suit individual cases.

5. Although discouraged both by the holy Quran and Hadith, yet like any other contract, there is also provision for the breach of marriage contract.

## Essentials of a Valid Marriage

The solemnization of marriage requires adherence to certain forms and formulas. They are called the essentials of a valid marriage. If any of these requirements is not fulfilled the marriage becomes either void or irregular, as the case may be.

### 1. Proposal and Acceptance (Ijab-o-Qubul)

- In a Muslim Marriage, proposal is referred to as **'ijab'** and acceptance of the same as **'qubul'**
- A proposal should be made by or on behalf of one party and the same should be accepted by the other party
- Marriage like any other contract is constituted by **ijab-o-qabool** that is by declaration and acceptance
- One party to the marriage must make an offer (Ijab) to the other party
- The marriage becomes complete only when the other party has accepted the offer

#### Presence

- According to Muslim Law it is absolutely necessary that a man or someone on his behalf and the woman or someone on her behalf should agree to the marriage at one meeting and the agreement should be witnessed by two adult witnesses
- The Words conveying proposal and acceptance must be uttered in each other's presence or in the presence of their agents, who are called **Vakil's**

#### One Meeting

- For a valid Muslim marriage, proposal and acceptance should be carried out at **the same meeting**
- If a proposal is made at one meeting and the acceptance of the proposal is done in the second meeting, it is not considered as valid

#### Reciprocity

- There must be reciprocity between offer and acceptance
- The acceptance must not be conditional
- The other condition for a valid marriage is that the transaction must be completed at one meeting
- A proposal made at one meeting and acceptance at another meeting does not constitute a valid marriage

#### Witnesses

- **Under the Sunni Law**: The proposal and acceptance must be made in presence of **two males or one male and two female witnesses** who are sane, adult and Muslim
- **Under Shia Law**: Witnesses are **not necessary** at the time of marriage. They are required at the time of dissolution of marriage

#### Free Consent

- The parties contracting marriage must be acting under their free will and consent
- Moreover there can be no marriage without free consent and such consent should not be obtained by means of coercion, fraud or undue influence

> **📌 Case Law: Mohiuddin v. Khatijabibi**
>
> The Court held that a marriage is invalid if it is held without free consent of the parties.

### 2. Competent Parties

The Parties to a marriage must have the capacity of entering into a contract. They must be competent to marry. Muslim who is of sound mind and who has attained puberty may enter into a contract of marriage. The parties must be able to understand the nature of their act.

#### Major

- For the purpose of Muslim marriage, the age when a person reaches puberty is considered as the age of puberty
- According to Hedaya, the age of Puberty for female is **9 years** and for male, it is **12 years**

> **📌 Case Law: Muhammad Ibrahim v. Atkia Begum & Anr.**
>
> The Privy Council held that under Muslim law, a girl is considered to have attained the age of puberty if:
> - (a) she has attained the age of **15 Years**, or
> - (b) attaining the state of puberty at an earlier age
>
> The same rule is also applicable to a Muslim Boy. Thus, it can also be said that in absence of any contrary, a Muslim is considered to have attained the age of puberty at **15 years**. After attaining the age of 15, parties can give their own consent and there is no need of consent of guardians.

#### Guardianship

- If a person is a minor, i.e, not attained the age of puberty, the consent of the guardian is required to make the marriage lawful
- The persons recognized as guardian under Muslim law are:
  1. **Father**
  2. **Paternal Grandfather**
  3. **Brother** or any other male member of father's family
  4. **Mother**
  5. **Members of Maternal Relation**
- The right passes from one guardian to other, in absence of the previous one, in order of priority
- In absence of any of these guardians, marriage may be contracted by **Qazi** or any other Government Authority

#### Soundness of Mind

- At the time of marriage, both the parties should be of sound mind
- Person of unsound mind has no capacity to enter into a contract and in the eyes of law his consent will be considered as no consent
- Unsoundness is of two types:
  - **Idiocy**: It refers to a complete abnormal state of mind. Person belonging to this category are incompetent to contract
  - **Lunacy**: It refers to a curable mental disease. A lunatic person can enter into a contract in the time interval in which he behaves like sane person

#### Puberty

- Every Muslim of sound mind who has attained the age of puberty, may enter into a contract of marriage
- Puberty means the age when there is a maturation of certain organs in a body, marked by the period of adolescence in one's life
- This time is marked by the body of the individual that is capable of performing sexual intercourse and aid in procreation
- With the assumed age of puberty to be **15 years**, a boy or a girl on attaining this age can validly consent to the marriage

> **⚠️ Note on Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929**
>
> According to the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929, a marriage of a male below the age of 21 and a female below the age of 18 is a child marriage and this act prohibits such marriage. Even though according to the uniform law, marriage between pubescent Muslims is violative, it is upheld under the personal laws of the Muslims.

> **📌 Case Law: Abdul Khader & Ors v. K. Pechiammal Child Marriage Prohibition Officer**
>
> The Madras High Court held that "The Prohibition of Child Marriages Act is not against the Muslim Personal Law. The Act, which was enacted to provide protection and for the welfare of the girl children takes precedence over the personal law. It only aids in the issues of education and empowerment."

#### Option of Puberty (Khayar-ul-Bulugh)

- A minor cannot legally enter into a marriage contract nor is the contract of marriage entered into by a guardian on his or her behalf, always binding on the minor
- The minor on attaining puberty may **ratify or revoke** such a contract if he or she chooses
- This right is called **Khayar-ul-Bulugh** (the option of puberty)
- This right is one of the plethoras of safeguards which the Islamic Law provides and it pertains against an undesirable marriage
- The right to repudiate a marriage by a woman flows from the Hadith and it comes to their rescue if such marriage had been forcefully imposed upon them by the assumption of their mental and physical incapacity to exercise her independent discretion in her marriage

### 3. No Legal Disability

Means the existence of certain circumstances under which marriage is not permitted. These prohibitions have been classified into four classes:

---

## Absolute Incapacity or Prohibition

---

## Relative Incapacity or Prohibition

Springs from cases which render the marriage invalid only so long as the cause which creates the bar exist. The moment it is removed, the incapacity ends and the marriage become valid and binding. The following are the cases:

### 1. Unlawful Conjunction

- It means contemporaneously marrying two women so related to each other by consanguinity, affinity or fosterage, which they could not have lawfully intermarried with each other if they had been of different sexes
- Thus a Muslim cannot marry two sisters, or an aunt and her niece

---

### 3. Absence of Proper Witnesses

- It is essential amongst the Sunnis that at least **two male witnesses or one male or two female witnesses** must be present to testify that the contract was properly entered into between the parties
- The witnesses must be of sound mind, adult and Muslim
- **In Shia Law**: A marriage contracted by the spouses themselves or their guardians in private are held valid. Presence of witnesses is **not necessary**

---

## Conversion to Islam for the Sake of Legitimizing a Marriage

> **📌 Case Law: Skinner v. Orde (1871) 14 M.I. A. 309**
>
> Helen Skinner was married according to Christian rites with George Skinner who died in the lifetime of Helen. Thereafter she cohabited with John Thomas who was married to Christian Wife, who was alive at that time. In order to legalize their union Helen and John both converted themselves into Islam. However their conversion was not held to be bona fide. It was held that this conversion was pretended for the purpose of Bigamy that was not permissible under the law.

---

## Conclusion

Muslim marriage is considered as a **"Civil Contract"**, unlike Hindu marriage where marriage is considered as sacrament. The basic aim of marriage in Muslim's is to legalize sexual relationship of male and female and giving birth to child. That is why, a valid contract is necessary for a Muslim marriage.
