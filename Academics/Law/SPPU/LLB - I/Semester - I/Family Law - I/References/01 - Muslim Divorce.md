# Muslim Divorce

## Introduction

In Muslim law, marriage is seen as a contractual agreement between two individuals, containing all the essential elements required for a valid contract, such as offer, acceptance, consent, consideration, and the capacity of parties. The primary purposes of Muslim marriage are to legalize sexual relations and facilitate the procreation of children within the boundaries set by Islam. It's recognized as a cornerstone of society, promoting the well-being of individuals and the continuation of the human race.

When it comes to ending a Muslim marriage, there are two main methods: **divorce** and **talaq**. While these terms are often used interchangeably in daily conversation, legally they have distinct implications. If someone seeks a 'divorce', they are subject to the provisions outlined in the **Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939**, which provides a legal framework for the dissolution of marriages in accordance with Muslim personal law. On the other hand, 'talaq' proceedings are governed by traditional Muslim personal laws, which outline the procedures and conditions for divorce within Islamic jurisprudence.

## Divorce Under Muslim Law

Under Muslim Law, the prerogative to initiate divorce lies solely with the husband. He retains the exclusive right to dissolve the marriage without the need for justification, simply by indicating his intent through specific pronouncements or actions. Conversely, a Muslim wife's ability to seek a divorce is contingent upon the husband's delegation of this right or through mutual agreement, such as Khula or Mubarat.

Before 1939, the options available to a Muslim wife seeking divorce were notably limited. Grounds for divorce were primarily restricted to cases involving false allegations of adultery, the husband's mental incapacity, or impotence. Divorce under Muslim Law could be classified under the following categories:

### By Husband

#### 1. Talaaq

Talaaq, originally meaning repudiation or rejection, signifies a release from the marital bond under Muslim law, either immediately or eventually. It is a broad term encompassing all forms of divorce, specifically initiated by or on behalf of the husband. Under Shia law, talaaq must be orally pronounced, with no specific wording requirements, but in the presence of two witnesses. Sunni law permits any mentally sound adult male to pronounce talaaq.

**i. Talaq-ul-Sunnat**

This type of talaaq adheres to the traditions of the Prophet and is further subdivided into:

- **a) Talaaq-i-ahsan**: After pronouncing talaaq, a three-month iddat period follows, accommodating three menstrual cycles of the wife. During this time, if the husband resumes cohabitation, the divorce is annulled.

- **b) Talaaq-i-hasan**: The husband must utter talaaq thrice in successive periods following menstrual cycles. He can revoke the first two pronouncements by express statement or resuming conjugal relations. Failure to revoke leads to the third pronouncement, resulting in marriage dissolution.

**ii. Talaq-al Biddat (Triple Talaq)**

This includes irrevocable forms of divorce and is frowned upon as an improper method. It takes immediate effect upon pronouncement, precluding any chance of reconciliation. This controversial practice allowed a Muslim man to divorce his wife by pronouncing talaq three times, without specifying a reason or requiring the wife's presence.

#### 2. Ila

In Ila, the husband pledges to abstain from sexual relations with his wife for four months. After this period, the marriage dissolves irrevocably. Resumption of cohabitation within four months nullifies Ila and preserves the marriage.

#### 3. Zihar

Zihar represents an incipient form of divorce, where the husband compares his wife unfavourably to a female relative within prohibited degrees of relation, rendering their marriage unlawful. The wife can withdraw from the husband until he expiates. Failure to do so empowers the wife to seek judicial divorce.

### By Wife

#### Talaaq-i-tafweez

Talaaq-i-tafweez or delegated divorce, is recognized by both Shia and Sunni schools of thought. It is the only mechanism through which a woman can initiate divorce, but this authority must be delegated by her husband. This agreement empowers the wife to dissolve the marital bond through divorce.

### By Mutual Consent

#### 1. Khula

Khula is a divorce by mutual consent initiated by the wife, whereby she agrees to forfeit her mahr (dowry) or provide some form of compensation to her husband. This option enables a woman to initiate divorce proceedings.

#### 2. Mubarat

Mubarat signifies mutual agreement between both spouses to end their marriage. Among Sunnis, upon entering mubarat, all mutual rights and obligations cease. Among Shias, the term mubarat must be followed by the Arabic word for divorce (talaaq) for the divorce to be valid, unless the parties are incapable of uttering Arabic words. Regardless of the sect, mubarat results in an irrevocable divorce.

## Divorce by Legal Means

### a. Lian

Lian refers to falsely accusing one's wife of adultery. In such cases, the wife retains the right to take legal action against her husband and seek a divorce decree on these grounds.

### b. Faskh

It means cancellation, abrogation, rescission, annulment. Following marriage can be cancelled by applying in court of law:

- Irregular marriage
- Option of puberty
- Marriage within prohibited degree

### c. Section 2 - Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939

According to **Section 2** of the Act, a woman married under Muslim law is entitled to obtain a decree for the dissolution of her marriage on one or more of the following grounds:

#### 1. Husband's Absence for Four Years

According to **Section 2(i)** of the **Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939**, if the whereabouts of the husband have been unknown for a period of **four years**, the wife can obtain a dissolution decree. This decree will take effect **six months** from the date of passing unless the husband reappears within that period, either in person or through an authorized agent, and demonstrates his willingness to resume his marital duties. In such a case, the court may set aside the decree.

#### 2. Failure to Provide Maintenance for Two Years

As provided under **Section 2(ii)** of the Act, if the husband has neglected or failed to provide for his wife's maintenance for **two years**, she can seek a decree of dissolution. Notably, **the husband cannot offer** poverty, ill health, or unemployment as a defense against this claim.

#### 3. Seven Years' Imprisonment of Husband

As per **Section 2(iii)** of the Act, if the husband has been sentenced to imprisonment **for seven years or more**, the wife is entitled to a divorce, provided the sentence has become final after any appeals. The decree will not be affected if the sentence is later reduced or remitted.

#### 4. Failure to Perform Marital Obligations

According to **Section 2(iv)** of the Act, if the husband has failed, without any reasonable cause, to perform his marital obligations for a period of **three years**, the wife may obtain a decree for the dissolution of her marriage.

#### 5. Impotency of Husband

As provided under **Section 2(v)** of the Act, if the husband was impotent at the time of the marriage and remains so, the wife may seek a divorce. However, if the husband, within **one year** from the date of the order, proves that he is no longer impotent, the court cannot pass a decree on this ground.

#### 6. Insanity, Leprosy, or Venereal Disease

According to **Section 2(vi)** of the Act, if the husband has been insane for **two years** or suffers from leprosy or a virulent venereal disease, the wife may seek a divorce on these grounds. Notably, leprosy or venereal disease need not have persisted for the full two years to qualify for dissolution; even recent cases may suffice.

#### 7. Repudiation of Marriage by Wife (Option of Puberty)

As per **Section 2(vii)** of the Act, a woman who was married by her father or guardian **before the age of 15** has the right to repudiate the marriage **upon attaining the age of 18**, provided the marriage has not been **consummated**. She is entitled to a decree of divorce on these grounds.

#### 8. Cruelty

Cruelty as defined in the Act under **Section 2(viii)** includes:

- Habitual physical or mental abuse, including dowry demands.
- Associating with women of ill repute or leading an infamous life, such as living in adultery with prostitutes.
- Forcing the wife into immoral acts, as in **Dawn v. Handerson**, where compelling a wife to have immoral relations was deemed extreme cruelty. In this case the court emphasized that forcing a chaste wife to submit to the advances of others constitutes extreme cruelty. There is no greater form of cruelty than compelling a woman to lead an immoral life. Outraging a woman's modesty also falls under the definition of cruelty.
- Disposing of the wife's property or obstructing her from exercising her legal rights over it.
- Preventing the wife from practicing her religion. This applies even to non-Muslim wives.
- Failing to treat the wife equitably when the husband has more than one wife. For example, in **Umatal-Hafiz v. Talib Hussain**, failing to provide for one of the two wives was deemed cruel. In **Itwari v Asghari**, the court observed that second marriage of the husband raises a presumption of cruelty to the first wife.

#### 9. Other Grounds

This provision covers other valid grounds under Muslim law, such as **Ila**, **Zihar**, **Khula**, **Mubara'at**, **Talak-i-tafweez**, and **Lian**.

- **Section 4**: Anyone pronouncing talaq in the manner described in Section 3 is subject to imprisonment for three years along with a fine.
- **Section 5**: Muslim women can demand maintenance and financial support from their spouses after divorce to sustain themselves and their children.
- **Section 6**: Both parents, including women, have equal rights over the custody of minor children after divorce. Both parties can contest for custody in court.

## Case Laws

### 1. Skinner v. Orde

In this case, a Christian woman and a married Christian man underwent a ceremony of conversion to Islam to legalize their relationship. However, the Privy Council held the marriage null and void, ruling that the conversion was not genuine and was done to evade personal laws, thus constituting fraud.

### 2. Sarla Mudgal v. Union of India

The Supreme Court of India interpreted Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code, stating that the second marriage of a Hindu husband after converting to Islam without legally dissolving his first marriage is invalid. Such an act constitutes bigamy under the law and the apostate husband is guilty of an offense under Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code.

### 3. Shayara Bano v. Union of India

Shayara Bano challenged the practice of triple talaq before the Supreme Court, arguing that it violated women's rights and dignity. In its landmark judgment, the Supreme Court declared triple talaq unconstitutional, stating that it was discriminatory and against the principles of gender equality. The judgment vindicated the position that triple talaq is against the constitutional morality and dignity of women, leading to significant legal reform in Muslim personal law.

## Conclusion

The **Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939**, stands as a progressive legislation significantly improving the position of Muslim women. Recognizing various grounds for divorce and empowering women to seek relief through judicial channels, marks a positive step toward gender equality and justice within the Muslim community. These changes are essential and commendable, fostering the autonomy and well-being of Muslim women in contemporary society.
