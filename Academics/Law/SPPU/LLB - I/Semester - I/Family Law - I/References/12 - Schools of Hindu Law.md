# Schools of Hindu Law

## Introduction

Hindu Law is a system of laws that governs the personal matters of Hindus, such as **marriage, inheritance, adoption, and succession**. It is based on the principles of **dharma**, which refers to duty, righteousness, and moral values in Hindu philosophy. Hindu Law is not codified, and it is primarily based on ancient Hindu scriptures, such as the Vedas, the Smritis, and the Puranas, as well as customs and traditions followed by Hindus for generations.

## Historical Origins of Hindu Law

The origins of Hindu Law can be traced back to ancient India, where it was formulated by rishis or sages who codified the principles of dharma into various texts known as **Smritis**. The most important Smritis are the **Manu Smriti**, the **Yajnavalkya Smriti**, and the **Narada Smriti**, which are considered authoritative sources of Hindu Law. These texts provide guidelines on various aspects of personal law, including marriage, inheritance, and property rights.

Over time, Hindu Law evolved through various interpretations and commentaries by scholars, philosophers, and jurists. Different schools of thought emerged based on their interpretations of the Smritis and other texts. These schools of Hindu Law have different perspectives and principles, and they continue to influence the legal system in India today.

## Schools of Hindu Law

There are two main schools of Hindu Law:

- **Mitakshara School**
- **Dayabhaga School**

---

## Mitakshara School

The **Yagnavalkya Smriti** was commented on by **Vijnaneshwara** under the title **Mitakshara**. The followers of Mitakshara are grouped together under the Mitakshara School. The Mitakshara is not only a commentary on the Smriti of Yajnavalkya but it is also a digest of practically all the leading Smritis of Hindu Law. The provisions of this School are applicable **throughout India except in the State of Bengal and Assam**. The Mitakshara has a very wide jurisdiction. However different parts of the country practice law differently because of the different customary rules followed by them.

### Sub-Schools Under the Mitakshara School

There are five Sub-Schools under the Mitakshara School which are as follows:

#### 1. Benaras Law School

- Dayabhaga school was formulated with a view to eradicating all the other absurd and artificial principles of inheritance
- The immediate benefit of this new digest is that it tends to remove all the shortcomings and limitations of the previously established principles and inclusion of many cognates in the list of heirs, which was restricted by the Mitakshara school
- The **Yagnavalkya Smriti** and some other Smritis are commented on by **Jimutavahana** under the title **Dayabhaga**
- It exists in **Bengal and Assam only**
- It has **no sub-school**

### Commentaries Followed in Dayabhaga School

## Difference Between Mitakshara and Dayabhaga School

| Aspect | Mitakshara School | Dayabhaga School |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Right to Ancestral Property** | The right to ancestral property arises **by birth** | The right to ancestral property is only given **after the death of the last owner** |
| **Co-ownership** | The son becomes the co-owner of the property sharing similar rights as of fathers | It does not recognise the birth right of any individual over ancestral property |
| **Alienation by Father** | The father **does not possess the absolute right** to alienate the property | The father **has the absolute right of alienation** of the ancestral property as he is the sole owner of that property during his lifetime |
| **Partition Rights** | The son attains the right to become the co-owner of the property and he can ask for the partition of the ancestral property even against the father and can demand for his share | The son has **no right to ask for the partition of ancestral property** against his father |
| **Survivorship Rule** | Under this school the **survivorship rule is prevalent**. In case of the death of any member in the joint family, his interest shall pass to other members of the family | While in case of Dayabhaga school the interest of the member on their death **shall pass on to their heirs** like widow, son, daughters |
| **Disposal of Property** | The members **can't dispose of their share of property** | The members of the family enjoy the **absolute right to dispose of their property** |
| **Inheritance Rule** | The rule of **blood relationship or consanguinity** is followed in case of inheritance | Inheritance is governed by the **rule of the offering of pinda** |

## Conclusion

The schools of Hindu Law in India, namely the **Mitakshara** and **Dayabhaga** have their own distinct principles, practices, and customs. These schools have evolved over time, and their principles have been shaped by various commentaries, judicial interpretations, and legislative reforms.

While the **Mitakshara School** is widely followed in most parts of India, the **Dayabhaga School** is followed primarily in West Bengal and other parts of eastern India, and the unique systems followed in Kerala are specific to that state.

The Mitakshara system is **Conservative**. It provides good security in times of difficulties as a member can rely on the joint family. However, sometimes a member can become a parasite. The Dayabhaga system is **more liberal**.

Among the two the **Dayabhaga is more likely to last in modern times** with the growth of individualism, individual enterprise and economic compulsions.
