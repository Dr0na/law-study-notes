# Live-in Relationships

## Introduction

India has witnessed a drastic change in the way the present generation perceives their relationships. The taboo that used to haunt partners in live-in relationships has also started to fade away with society opening up about the idea of pre-marital sex and live-in relationships.

This improved mindset is a result of freedom, privacy, profession, education and also globalization. Moreover, for most of us – it is not an escape from responsibilities but a way to understand our partner and to check if at all we are compatible. A live-in relationship not only gives the couple an opportunity to know the partner without having to engage into a legally binding relationship but also excludes the chaos of family drama and lengthy court procedures in case the couple decides to break up.

It involves continuous cohabitation between the partners without any responsibilities or obligations towards one another. There is no law tying them together, and consequently, either of the partners can walk out of the relationship, as and when they want.

## Meaning

It is a **'relationship in the nature of marriage'** is akin to a common law marriage. Common law marriages require that although not being formally married:

- (a) The couple must hold themselves out to society as being akin to spouses.
- (b) They must be of legal age to marry.
- (c) They must be otherwise qualified to enter into a legal marriage, including being unmarried.
- (d) They must have voluntarily cohabited and held themselves out to the world as being akin to spouses for a significant period of time.

## Difference Between Marriage and Live-in Relationship

### Marriage

The institution of marriage is a socially and ritually accepted union and a contract between spouses that institutes rights and legal obligations towards each other. In light of the diverse culture in India, separate laws have been formulated which lay down the procedure and guidelines for proper execution of marriages in various religions. Marriage laws have been created to provide remedies for disputes arising out of marriage in different religions.

In addition to the law of maintenance under personal laws, **Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure** also provides for maintenance if the wife cannot maintain herself. Women can also seek extra-maintenance apart from the maintenance received by her under any other law as per **Section 20(1)(d) of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act**.

### Live-in Relationship

There is no law binding the partners together and subsequently, either of the partners can walk out of the relationship, as and when they wish to do so. There is no legal definition of live-in relationship, and therefore, the legal status of such type of relations is also unconfirmed. The right to maintenance in a live-in relationship is decided by the court by the Domestic Violence Act and the individual facts of the case.

Though the common man is still hesitant in accepting this kind of relationship, the **Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act** provides for the protection and maintenance thereby granting the right of alimony to an aggrieved live-in partner.

## Reasons Behind Live-in Relationship

- They may want to test their compatibility before they commit to a legal union.
- They may want to maintain their single status for financial reasons.
- In some cases, such as those involving gay or lesbian couples, or individuals already married to another person, the law does not allow them to marry.
- In other cases, the partners may feel that marriage is unnecessary.
- Most couples go for live-in relations because they hate to be divorced.
- Existed marriage is unsuccessful or legal and social difficulties arose in separation.
- Marriage may not be supported or not allowed by family due to inter-religion, age difference etc.
- Sometimes they are scared from responsibilities arose as a married partner, thereafter as parents.
- Couple gives priority to the career rather than marriage. Therefore live-in relationship is best option for them where there is no commitment and no time for partner.
- To escape the loneliness in their lives senior citizens have started preferring live in relationships.

## Advantages

### 1. Lesser Duties

It is found that married couples tend to share the responsibilities of their families, finances, and societal duties. These couples always try to maintain a satisfactory balance in the society. While being in a live-in relationship you do not need to make those necessary compromises that are often important in a marriage. You can even share and divide your expenses and there is no pressure of pleasing the relatives and parents of both side and people in such relationship can enjoy personal space.

### 2. Little Legal Harassment

If people are in live in relationship then they are free from any legal obligations. Divorce is considered to be a bad end of marital relationship and people in marital relationship can have either bitter or traumatic experience. Whereas in live-in relationship you are free from any legal harassment and you do not have to keep any unsatisfying and suffocating relationship.

### 3. Financial Freedom

Among all other advantages, financial freedom is the biggest advantages of live-in relationship. In marriage you will have to maintain joint financial ventures and dual banking operations and the couples always stay alert of their income and spending. In live in relationship you both can divide the bill and can enjoy financial freedom.

### 4. Test for Marriage

In today's world the rate of divorce is increasing so it not might be a bad idea to test runs a relationship to see whether the relationship is working or not. In such relationship you can assess your partner more accurately and honestly. For example:-your partner can pretend in front of you for sometime but it would be difficult to pretend for 24x7.

### 5. Mutual Respect

In this type of relationship neither of you are dependent upon each other either financially nor socially or legally so you both are likely to enjoy equal space and tend to have respect in the relationship.

## Disadvantages

### 1. Criticism from Society

Although live-in relationships tend to rise in urban India yet our society finds hard to accept such type of relationship open-heartedly. It is considered as a taboo especially by the elderly people of our society. Couples in such type of relationship are often harassed by the society for their individual choice. Our society is likely to divide couples in the name of caste, class and religion so they cannot expect to see a live-in relationship.

### 2. Easy to Come Out

Easy to come out is considered to be a very good advantage of being in a live-in relationship but this is one of the biggest disadvantages because it lacks commitment. A partner can easily walk out of the relationship if there is any small fight, disagreement, or a misplaced question whereas a married couple try to find out solutions before they split up.

### 3. Females are Suffering the Most

It is the woman who suffers most biologically, socially and emotionally if a live-in relationship fails to work out. In our society, patriarchal norms are being followed so it is the women who bear the worst burns. They are not able to find a good and understanding spouse after being in a live-in relationship.

### 4. Effect on Children

If any child is born in a live-in relationship then the child is mostly affected. Firstly, they will lack in respecting the rules and norms. The edge of unfaithfulness is likely to bear in their mind. Secondly, there will be no legal custodial ground if the couple walks out of such relationship. The child will not be able to inherit anything either from father or mother side since their parent's relationship are free from legal binding.

### 5. Disrespect for Marriage

It is found that couples in live in relationship often lack to see the depth of marriage. People delay in marriage because they find that in live in relationship it is easy to come out. Personal and financial freedom in live in relationship creates fear in people to bear the responsibilities of marriage.

## Provisions

### Maintenance of Lady Partner

The right of maintenance is available to wives under all personal laws in India. However, none of the religions recognizes and accept live-in relationships. Since no remedy is granted to women involved in a live-in relationship, Indian Courts have widened the scope of maintenance under the Criminal Procedure Code. Therefore, **Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code** has been provided to give a legal right of maintenance to lady partners in or out of a marriage.

### Domestic Violence

The Domestic Violence Act was enforced as an attempt to protect women from abusive (physical, mental, verbal or economic) marital relationships. However, as per **Section 2(f)**, it not only applies to a married couple, but also to a **'relationship in nature of marriage'**. Therefore, considering all this even the Supreme Court in a couple of cases has allowed live-in relationships to be covered within the ambit of the law specified.

### Children out of Marriage

Partners living together for a long time may have kids together. However, live-in couples are not allowed to adopt kids as per the Guidelines Governing the Adoption of Children as notified by the Central Adoption Resource Authority. In case of dispute with respect to custody of the child, you may also consult a Child Custody Lawyer.

### Legitimacy and Inheritance Rights of Children

Inheritance rights of children are mentioned in **Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act**, where the legal status of legitimacy is provided even to illegitimate children (those born out of marriage) for the sole purpose of inheritance. Therefore, inheritance rights have been granted to children born out of a live-in relationship. These rights are available in both ancestral and self-bought properties.

### Custody and Maintenance Rights of Children

The position on the maintenance rights of children out of marriage varies in personal marriage laws. For instance, under the Hindu Law the father has to maintain the child, whereas under the Muslim Law the father has been absolved of such an obligation. However, under **Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code**, remedy is available for children who are unable to claim maintenance under personal laws. Section 125 provides a legal right of maintenance to wives, children.

### Dowry

The Supreme Court held that dowry can occur in a marital or non-marital relationship (but resembling a marriage), as it is just an unjust demand for money. In the case of **Koppisetti Subbarao Subramanian vs. State of Andhra Pradesh**, where the defendant would harass the live-in partner for dowry, the court reject the claim made by him that Section 498A did not apply in this instance, as he was not married to the woman. The Supreme Court delivered a landmark judgment, as it went a step further to protect woman from harassment and dowry in a live-in relationship.

### Rights of the Male Partner

'The rights of a male partner' is hotly debated amongst the men's rights activists and the judges, where the former accuses the latter of always gravitating towards the other sex. As of very recently, only women can claim maintenance from men in a live-in relationship. Even in the case of **S. Khushboo v. Kanniammal & Anr.**, the court drew an assumption that 'a live-in relationship is invariably initiated and perpetuated by men'. While this relationship is based on gender parity, the desired justice is a far cry.

### Inheritance Rights of the Partners

Partners in a live-in relationship do not enjoy a right of inheritance to the property of their partner. The **Hindu Succession Act, 1956** does not specify the succession rights of the partners in a live-in relationship. But in the case of **Vidhyadhari v. Sukhrana Bai**, the court held that a couple living together for a reasonably long time can receive property in inheritance from either partner.

### Status of Children from Live-in Relationships

In comparison to formal marriage, the legitimacy of the children born in the live-in relationship is often questioned. Despite the increasing trend of couples entering in informal relationships, children from these relationships have serious legal implications.

**Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act 1872** recognizes a legitimate child, only if it was born during the continuance of a valid marriage between the mother and the father. An until recent children born from a live-in relationship were considered illegitimate in the eyes of law. But in the case of **Tulsa v. Durghatiya**, the Supreme Court awarded legal status to the children born from a live-in relationship. Having said that the court also mentioned that the couple should have lived under a roof for a reasonable amount of time. Besides, **Section 125 CrPC** provides maintenance to children whether they are legitimate or illegitimate, till they are minors or after majority if the child is unable to maintain himself.

Nevertheless, the court in the case of **Dimple Gupta v. Rajiv Gupta**, held in the furtherance of the above-stated view that children from live-in relationships have the right to maintenance.

### Adoption

In June 2018, the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) has barred couples in a live-in relationship from adopting a child, after its Steering Committee held that cohabitation without marriage is not considered a stable family in India.

### Rape Allegations

Recently, Public interest Litigation was filed in the Delhi High Court which sought the government to keep the cases of live-in relationships outside the purview of rape under the Indian Penal Code. However, the High Court dismissed the PIL stating that nobody could be arrested only on the basis of an allegation of rape prior to conducting a preliminary inquiry; there are an alarming number of rape cases registered by the police, which the police suspects have germinated due to termination of the live-in relationship or simply refusal to marry. According to the report by the Delhi Police, at least 25 per cent of the registered rape cases in a live-in relationship were false. In spite of this, a man living in with a woman is not immune to the charges of rape; in furtherance to the idea of rape in a domesticated setting, marital rape is not a crime regardless of the status of matrimony.

### Divorce or Break-up

In the case of a live-in relationship, it is not possible to have a formal divorce in the eyes of law. The consequences of the dissolution of this relationship are left unanswered in law, for example, the absence of law in case of division of their joint property after separation. Though it is fairly easy to get into a live-in relationship but the aftermath of dissolution is still ambiguous.

## Position Outside India

The European countries are worst affected by 'Live-in –relationship'. In most places, it is legal for unmarried people to live together. The law introduced in 1999 in France makes provisions for "civil solidarity pacts" allowing couples (even of same sex) to enter into a union and be entitled to the same rights as married couples in such areas as income tax, inheritance, housing and social welfare. Couples, who want to enter into such a relationship may sign up before a court clerk and can revoke the contract unilaterally or by bilaterally with a simple declaration, made in writing, which gives the partner three months' notice.

**Article 147, of the Family Code, Philippines** provides that when a man and a woman who are capacitated to marry each other, live exclusively with each other as husband and wife without the benefit of marriage or under a void marriage, their wages and salaries shall be owned by them in equal shares and the property acquired by both of them through their work or industry shall be governed by the rules on co-ownership.

## Case Laws

### Badri Prasad vs. Dy. Director of Consolidation, 1978

This was the first case in which the Supreme Court of India recognized live in relationship and interpreted it as a valid marriage. In this case, the Court gave legal validity to a 50 year live in relationship of a couple. It was held by Justice Krishna Iyer that a strong presumption arises in favour of wedlock where the partners have lived together for a long term as husband and wife. Although the presumption is rebuttable, a heavy burden lies on him who seeks to deprive the relationship of its legal origin. Law leans in favour of legitimacy and frowns upon bastardy.

### Tulsa & Ors vs. Durghatiya & Ors, 2008

The Supreme Court provided legal status to the children born from live in relationship. It was held that one of the crucial pre-conditions for a child born from live-in relationship to not be treated as illegitimate are that the parents must have lived under one roof and co-habited for a considerably long time for society to recognize them as husband and wife and it must not be a "walk in and walk out" relationship. Therefore, the court also granted the right to property to a child born out of a live in relationship.

### D. Velusamy vs. D. Patchaiammal, 2010

The judgment determined certain pre-requisites for a live in relationship to be considered valid. It provides that The couple must hold themselves out to society as being akin to spouses and must be of legal age to marry or qualified to enter into a legal marriage, including being unmarried. It was stated that the couple must have voluntarily cohabited and held themselves out to the world as being akin to spouses for a significant period of time. The court held that not all relationships will amount to a relationship in the nature of marriage and get the benefit of the Domestic Violence Act. It further clarified that, if a man keeps women as a servant and maintains her financially and uses mainly for sexual purposes, such relationship would not be considered as marriage in the court of law. Therefore to get such benefit the conditions mentioned by the Court must be satisfied, and has to be proved by evidence.

Here, the court relied on the concept of **'palimony'** which was used in the USA for grant of maintenance in live in relationships. The concept of palimony was derived in the case of **Marvin vs. Marvin**, a landmark judgment of the California Superior Court.

### S. Khushboo vs. Kanniammal & Anr, 2010

The Supreme Court in this case dropped all the charges against the petitioner who was a south Indian actress. The petitioner was charged under Section 499 of the IPC and it was also claimed that the petitioner endorsed pre-marital sex and live in relationships. The court held that living together is not illegal in the eyes of law even if it is considered immoral in the eyes of the conservative Indian society. The court stated that living together is a right to life and therefore not 'illegal'.

### Indra Sarma vs. V.K.V. Sarma, 2013

The recent judgment of the Supreme Court has illustrated five categories where the concept of live in relationships can be considered and proved in the court of law. Following are the categories:

- Domestic relationship between an adult male and an adult female, both unmarried. It is the most uncomplicated sort of relationship
- Domestic relationship between a married man and an adult unmarried woman, entered knowingly.
- Domestic relationship between an adult unmarried man and a married woman, entered knowingly. Such relationship can lead to a conviction under Indian Penal Code for the crime of adultery
- Domestic relationship between an unmarried adult female and a married male, entered unknowingly
- Domestic relationship between same sex partners (gay or lesbian)

The Court stated that a live-in relationship will fall within the expression **"relationship in the nature of marriage"** under **Section 2(f) of the Protection of women Against Domestic Violence Act, 2005** and provided certain guidelines to get an insight of such relationships. Also, there should be a close analysis of the entire relationship, in other words, all facets of the interpersonal relationship need to be taken into account, including the individual factors.

## Conclusion

Thus, the legal status of live-in relationships in India has been evolved and determined by the Supreme Court in its various judgments. However, there is no separate legislation which lays down the provisions of live in relationships and provides legality to this concept. Though the concept of live-in relationship is considered immoral by the society, but is definitely not illegal in the eyes of the law. The Supreme Court states that living together is a right to life and therefore it cannot be held illegal. The court has also tried to improve the conditions of the women and children borne out of live in relationships by defining their status under the **Domestic Violence Act, 2005** if the relationship is proved to be "relationship in the nature of marriage". In a recent case of May 5th, 2015, the Supreme Court bench of Justices Vikramajit Sen and A M Sapre, dismissed a petition by the petitioner 'Z' who worked in the Bollywood and contended that the respondent could not claim the status of a wife to be legally entitled to get maintenance under the **Hindu Marriage Act, 1955**. The Court held that cohabitation of a couple would give rise to the presumption of a valid marriage and if a live in relationship breaks down, the man is bound to pay maintenance to the women.
