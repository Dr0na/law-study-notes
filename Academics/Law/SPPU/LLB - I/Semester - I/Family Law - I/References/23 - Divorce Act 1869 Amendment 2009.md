Union of India [W.P. No. 12816 of 1995]** that suitable amendment of Section 2 of the Divorce Act 1869 be considered, vide their DO letter No. A-60011/25/2009-Admn.III(LA) dated 30.03.2009.

## Section 2 of the Divorce Act 1869

Section 2 of the Divorce Act 1869, which provides for the extent of the Act as well as the power to grant relief generally, reads:

> **"This Act extends to the whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir.**
>
> **Nothing hereinafter contained shall authorise any court to grant any relief under this Act except where the petitioner or respondent professes the Christian religion,**
>
> **and to make decrees of dissolution of marriage except where the parties to the marriage are domiciled in India at the time when the petition is presented,**
>
> **or to make decrees of nullity of marriage except where the marriage has been solemnized in India and the petitioner is resident in India at the time of presenting the petition,**
>
> **or to grant any relief under this Act, other than a decree of dissolution of marriage or of nullity of marriage, except where the petitioner resides in India at the time of presenting the petition."**

### Key Issues

1. The Divorce Act 1869 can also be invoked to dissolve Christian marriages performed outside India
2. However, this Act does **not confer jurisdiction** on the Indian courts to dissolve Christian marriages of non-domiciled parties
3. In determining the domicile of the parties in a proceeding for dissolution of marriage, it is the **domicile of the husband alone** which is to be considered inasmuch as a wife takes the domicile of her husband upon her marriage

## Domicile vs. Residence

### The Problem

The jurisdiction of the courts in India to exercise authority under the Divorce Act 1869 was varied by an amending Act of 1926. Prior to the amendment of the Divorce Act 1869 in the year 1926 which came into force from **25th March 1926**, the jurisdiction conferred on the courts in India under the Divorce Act 1869 to make decrees of dissolution of marriage on the basis of residence was **not restricted to the cases of persons domiciled in India**.

A court could pass a decree of divorce if the parties to the action resided within the jurisdiction of the court at the time of the presentation of the petition. In other words, **residential test of the parties was enough** and domicile was not essential to confer jurisdiction on the courts in India under this Act.

### Amendment of 1926

Two conditions were required to be satisfied prior to the amendment of 1926 for the purpose of exercising jurisdiction by the courts in India at the time of presenting the petition in the court. But in the case of **Keyes v. Keyes [1921] P. 204**, it was held that the court had no jurisdiction where the respondent had foreign domicile. In **Isharani's case (AIR 1926 Cal 871)**, the test laid down in Keyes' case was not followed. But accepting the test of the latter case the Indian Divorce Act 1869 was amended in 1926.

By the amendment, the courts in India are **not empowered to pass any decree for dissolution of marriage** except in cases where the parties to the marriage are domiciled in India professing Christian faith at the time of presenting the petition. The domicile of the wife is the domicile of the husband. It is in accord with the rule of Private International Law.

### Meaning of Residence

**Residence** means the place where one actually lives, as distinguished from a domicile. Residence must be **bona fide residence**.

A Full Bench of the Kerala High Court in **T. J. Poonen v. Rathi Varghese (AIR 1967 Kerala 1 (FB))** after considering various decisions gave the following propositions:

1. To constitute 'residence' it is not necessary that the party or parties must have his or their own house

2. To constitute 'residence' the stay need not be permanent; it can be temporary, so long as there is **animus manendi** or an intention to stay for an indefinite period

3. 'Residence' will not take in a casual stay in, or flying visit to a particular place; a mere casual residence in a place for a temporary purpose, with no intention of remaining, is not covered by the word 'reside'

4. 'Residence' connotes something more than stay; it implies some intention to remain at a place, and not merely to pay it a casual visit

5. As emphasized by the Supreme Court, by staying in a particular place, in order to constitute 'residence', the intention must be to make it his or their abode or residence, either permanent or temporary

6. The expression 'last resided' also means the place where the person had his last abode or residence, either permanent or temporary

7. Where there has been residence together of a more permanent character, and a casual or brief residence together, Courts have taken the view that it is only the former that can be considered as 'residence together' for determining the jurisdiction

8. The question as to whether a particular person has chosen to make a particular place his abode, is to be gathered from the particular circumstances of each case

### Modern Legislative Trends

The above amendment brought about by the **Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act 2003** was prompted by the recommendations of the Law Commission of India and the National Commission for Women. The Law Commission had expressed the view that such an amendment would give a wife, deserted or thrown out, the choice of court, including where she is residing, to file a petition, relieving her of unbearable burden of expense and inconvenience as well as advancing the cause of gender justice.

#### Examples from Other Acts

For example, under the **Hindu Marriage Act 1955** and the **Special Marriage Act 1954**, a petition for divorce may be filed by a wife at the place where she is residing on the date of the presentation of the petition, vide the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act 2003.

**Sub-section (2) of section 31 of the Special Marriage Act 1954** even before the said 2003 Act provided that a petition for divorce by a wife could be filed here if she had been ordinarily resident in India for a period of three years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition irrespective of the husband's residence being outside.

Thus, her residence may well constitute the basis of jurisdiction for a petition for divorce by a wife irrespective of her domicile.

## 15th Report of the Law Commission (1960)

The **15th Report of the Law Commission of India** deals with the law relating to marriage and divorce amongst Christians in India. The Commission gave its proposal in the form of a draft Bill titled **"The Christian Marriage and Matrimonial Causes Bill 1960"**.

The Commission recommended that the proposed legislation should apply to all marriages solemnized within the territories of India whatever the domicile of the parties thereto, and that it should leave no vacuum therein. It followed the scheme adopted in the Special Marriage Act 1954 and the Hindu Marriage Act 1955 and also the pattern of similar legislation in England which binds all persons within the kingdom.

### Clause 35 (a) of the Draft Bill

Clause 35 (a) of the said Bill specifically deals with the jurisdiction of the Indian courts to grant divorce and reads:

> **"Nothing contained in this Act shall authorize any court –**
>
> **(a) to make any decree of dissolution of marriage, except where-**
>
> **(i) the parties to the marriage are domiciled in India at the time of the presentation of the petition; or**
>
> **(ii) the petitioner, being the wife, was domiciled in India immediately before the marriage and has been residing in India for a period of not less than three years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition."**

> **⚠️ Note**: The above Bill proposed by the Law Commission was not enacted.

## Conclusion and Recommendation

### Problem Identified

Section 2 of the Divorce Act 1869 insofar as it concerns the jurisdictional rule in regard to petitions for divorce is not only **not in tune with the present times** but is also **harsh upon Christian women in India**.

### Recommendations

#### Primary Recommendation

Section 2 of the Divorce Act 1869 should be suitably amended in order that the Indian courts shall be entitled to entertain a petition for dissolution of a Christian marriage where **either of the parties to the marriage is domiciled in India** at the time when the petition is presented.

> **⚠️ Important Consideration**: However, this suggestion would also need simultaneous change in the rule of Private International Law as to a wife's domicile, that is, **abolition of wife's dependent domicile**, as done in England through the Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1973.

#### Alternative Recommendation

Following the **Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act 2003**, the said provision may be amended to provide that a petition for divorce may be filed by a Christian wife at the place where she is residing on the date of the presentation of the petition.

#### Recommendation for Uniformity

It is further felt that for uniformity, similar position should prevail in regard to all other matrimonial statutes, including:

- The Special Marriage Act 1954
- The Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act 1936
- The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act 1939
- The Hindu Marriage Act 1955
