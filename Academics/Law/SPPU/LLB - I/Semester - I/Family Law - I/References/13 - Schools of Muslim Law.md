# Schools of Muslim Law

## Introduction

At the time of the death of the **Prophet**, there was a quarrel between the two groups for **imamate** (the temporal leadership of the religion). One group advocated the principle of the election in choosing the 'Imam', this group is known as **'Sunni'**. The adherents to the 'Sunni' doctrine are called **'Sunni Muslims'**.

While, the other group opposed the principle of the election in choosing the 'Imam' and proclaimed that **'Ali'** is the successor of the 'Prophet'. They firmly believe that imamat must be devolved upon the successors of the prophet, i.e.:

- **Ali**, the son in law
- **Fatima**, the daughter of Prophet

This group is known as **'Shia'**.

## Conclusion

Muslim law is governed by the teachings of the **Quran** and the **Prophet Mohammad**. There have been many different schools which follow their own interpretations of these teachings on points on which the Quran is silent. While the major schools of Muslims can be divided under the two sects of **Shia schools** and **Sunni schools**, even the schools under these sects have been further divided into various schools.

Each school has its own beliefs and practices and because is no set rule regarding the matters on which the Quran is silent, one school cannot be said to be better positioned than the other schools and thus even though there are many schools in Muslim law, they all lead to one path. Thus, the teachings of these schools can be compared to different paths which all lead to the same destination.
