# LC 0503 - Family Law I

## Objectives of the Course

The personal law applicable to Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Parsis, and other denominations is not fully codified. While these personal laws share broad underlying principles, they differ significantly in details. Personal law governs:

- **Family relations**: marriage, divorce, support and maintenance, custody and guardianship of children, adoption, etc.
- **Property law**: joint family systems, devolution of property upon death.

Differences arise from the historical development of these laws over centuries. This course covers:

- History and development of principles and provisions of different personal laws.
- Sources of these laws.
- Laws applicable to family relations: marriage, divorce, maintenance, alimony, adoption, guardianship.
- General laws applicable to all persons: **Special Marriage Act, 1963** and **Foreign Marriages Act, 1969**.

The course aims to help students understand family law beyond religious boundaries, moving toward the Constitutional directive of a **Uniform Civil Code**.
