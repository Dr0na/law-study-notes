# Maintenance under BNSS

## Introduction

The **Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS)** is a legislative framework aiming to streamline the diverse aspects of the law that shall enable the safety of Indian citizens. The legislation comprises several provisions covering public safety, justice and procedural reforms. The Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), enacted in **2023**, includes specific provisions for maintenance under **Section 144 to 147**. This section aims to protect individuals who are unable to support themselves financially, ensuring that those with sufficient means do not neglect their dependents.

## Meaning

The dictionary meaning of the term **maintenance** is **support or sustenance**. The term maintenance is not defined in the marriage laws of any of the religious communities. But the entitlement of claiming maintenance is certainly based on the assumption that the claimant doesn't have the sufficient means to support herself.

### Key Points

- Maintenance generally covers the expenses for **necessaries or essentials** for the substance of life
- It is **not merely a right for survival** of the claimant
- The court considers various factors:
  - Possession of property of both parties
  - Ability of the husband to earn
  - Conduct of the parties
  - Other circumstances
  - **Status of the parties** and **standard of living** enjoyed during the subsistence of marriage

## Maintenance Provisions (Sections 144 to 147)

### Section 144: Order for Maintenance of Wives, Children and Parents

#### Sub-section (1) - Who Can Claim Maintenance

If any person having **sufficient means** neglects or refuses to maintain:

---

##### ✅ (a) His wife, unable to maintain herself

**Case Law:**

> **📌 Abdul Salim v. Nagima Begam**  
> The Court held that the phrase **"unable to maintain herself"** should not be interpreted to mean that a wife in order to claim maintenance should be an absolute destitute or should be in tattered clothes, or should be the first one out of the street to beg. The very fact is that she has no other means of her own other than that of her husband to maintain her adequately to entitle her to the right of maintenance.

**📌 Chaturbhuj v. Sita Bai (2008)**  
The Supreme Court clarified that the term **"unable to maintain herself"** does not mean that the wife must be absolutely destitute before she can apply for maintenance. It is sufficient if she does not have an independent income sufficient for her livelihood. The Court held that even if the wife earns some income, she can still claim maintenance if it is not enough for her sustenance.

**📌 Bhuwan Mohan Singh v. Meena (2014)**  
The Supreme Court reiterated that Section 125 CrPC (now Section 144 BNSS) is a measure of **social justice** and is specially enacted to protect women and children. The Court emphasized that the object of the provision is to prevent vagrancy and destitution, and the wife is entitled to live with dignity, similar to her husband's standard of living.

**📌 Rajnesh v. Neha (2020)**  
The Supreme Court laid down comprehensive guidelines regarding the payment of maintenance in matrimonial matters:

- Affidavit of disclosure of assets and liabilities should be filed by both parties
- Maintenance should be granted **from the date of application** to avoid undue hardship

---

##### ✅ (b) His legitimate or illegitimate child, whether married or not, unable to maintain itself

**Case Law:**

**📌 Vijaya Manohar Arbat v. Kashiram Rajara Sawai**  
The Supreme Court in a landmark judgement held that the **married daughter is liable to provide maintenance to their aged parents** if they are unable to maintain themselves. The Court held that married daughter does not cease to be daughter on her getting married. Furthermore, the Court held that if it is to be decided that daughter has no liability to maintain their aged parents, those who have no son only daughter, would become destitute and beggar if their daughter provides for maintenance.

---

##### ✅ (c) His legitimate or illegitimate child (not being a married daughter) who has attained majority

Where such child is, by reason of any **physical or mental abnormality or injury** unable to maintain itself.

---

##### ✅ (d) His father or mother, unable to maintain himself or herself

> **📌 Shailaja & another Vs Kohbbanna (Crl. Appeal No.125-126 of 2017)**
> It was held by Hon'ble Supreme Court that reducing the maintenance to the wife of Rs.6,000/- from Rs.15,000/- that she is capable of earning is **not sufficient reason to reduce the maintenance**. Whether the Appellant No.1 (Wife) is capable of earning or whether she is actually earning are two different requirements.

---

#### Sub-section (2) - Effect of Civil Court Decision

Where it appears to the Magistrate that in consequence of any decision of a **competent Civil Court**, any order made under section 144 should be cancelled or varied, he shall:

- Cancel the order, or
- Vary the same accordingly

---

#### Sub-section (3) - Cancellation for Divorced Women

Where any order has been made under section 144 in favour of a woman who has been divorced by, or has obtained a divorce from, her husband, the Magistrate shall, if he is satisfied that:

##### **(a) Remarriage**

The woman has, after the date of such divorce, **remarried** → cancel such order as from the date of her remarriage

##### **(b) Payment of Customary Sum**

The woman has been divorced by her husband and that she has received, whether before or after the date of the said order, the **whole of the sum** which, under any customary or personal law applicable to the parties, was payable on such divorce → cancel such order:

- **(i)** In the case where such sum was paid **before such order**, from the date on which such order was made
- **(ii)** In any other case, from the date of expiry of the period, if any, for which maintenance has been actually paid by the husband to the woman

> **📌 Bai Tahira v. Ali Hussain Fissali**  
> It was held by the SC that if the amount of deferred 'Mehar paid at the time of divorce is adequately to sustain the wife through her life time then an order of maintenance U/S.125 shall be liable to be cancelled in accordance to S.127(3). The same view point was reiterated in **Fuzlumbi v. K. Khader Ali**.

**📌 Mohd. Ahmed Khan v. Shah Bano Begum (1985)** - *Landmark Case*  
In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that Section 125 CrPC (now Section 144 BNSS) applies to **all citizens, irrespective of religion**, and that a divorced Muslim woman is entitled to maintenance if she cannot maintain herself. The Court emphasized that the provision is a measure of **social justice** intended to protect dependents from destitution.  
**Key Point:** Mehar is an amount paid in consideration of money and not of divorce and hence, it does not fulfil the condition of the S.127(3)(b). Therefore, irrespective of the amount of deferred Mehar 'at the time of divorce an amount of maintenance cannot be cancelled U/S. 127(3)(b).

##### **(c) Voluntary Surrender**

The woman has obtained a divorce from her husband and that she had **voluntarily surrendered her rights** to maintenance or interim maintenance, as the case may be, after her divorce → cancel the order from the date thereof.

At the time of making any decree for the recovery of any maintenance or dowry by any person, to whom a monthly allowance for the maintenance and interim maintenance or any of them has been ordered to be paid under section 144, the **Civil Court shall take into account** the sum which has been paid to, or recovered by, such person as monthly allowance for the maintenance and interim maintenance or any of them, as the case may be, in pursuance of the said order.

---

### Section 147: Enforcement of Order of Maintenance

A copy of the order of maintenance or interim maintenance and expenses of proceedings, as the case may be, shall be given **without payment** to:

- The person in whose favour it is made, or
- His guardian, if any, or
- The person to whom the allowance for the maintenance or the allowance for the interim maintenance and expenses of proceeding, as the case may be, is to be paid

- **Wives**
- **Children**
- **Elderly parents**

receive the financial support they need to maintain a basic standard of living. The framework aims to provide a structured and efficient process for claiming maintenance, thereby enhancing the protection of dependents in India.
