### (i) Adoption of Son

### (ii) Adoption of Daughter

### (v) Simultaneous Adoption

### (vi) Actual Giving and Taking

The child to be adopted must be **actually given and taken in adoption** by the parents or guardian concerned or under their authority with intent to transfer the child from the family of its birth (or in the case of an abandoned child or child whose parentage is not known, from the place or family where it has been brought up) to the family of its adoption.

**PROVIDED that** the performance of **datta homam** shall not be essential to the validity of adoption.

## Section 12: Effects of Adoption

### Main Rule

An adopted child shall be deemed to be the child of his or her adoptive father or mother for all purposes with effect from the date of the adoption and from such date all the ties of the child in the family of his or her birth shall be deemed to be **severed and replaced** by those created by the adoption in the adoptive family.

### Proviso - Exceptions

**PROVIDED that:**

- **(a)** The child **cannot marry** any person whom he or she could not have married if he or she had continued in the family of his or her birth.
- **(b)** Any property which vested in the adopted child **before the adoption** shall continue to vest in such person subject to the obligations, if any, attaching to the ownership of such property including the obligation to maintain relatives in the family of his or her birth.
- **(c)** The adopted child shall **not divest** any person of any estate which vested in him or her before the adoption.

### Case Law

**Case:** Smt. Sitabai v. Ramchandra, AIR 1970 SUPREME COURT 343

> It is clear on a reading of the main part of Section 12 and sub-section (vi) of Section 11 that the effect of adoption under the Act is that it brings about severance of all ties of the child given in adoption in the family of his or her birth. The child altogether ceases to have any ties with the family of his birth. Correspondingly, these very ties are automatically replaced by those created by the adoption in the adoptive family. The legal effect of giving the child in adoption must therefore be to transfer the child from the family of its birth to the family of its adoption.

## Section 13: Right of Adoptive Parents to Dispose of Their Properties

Subject to any agreement to the contrary, an adoption does **not deprive** the adoptive father or mother of the power to dispose of his or her property by:

- Transfer **inter vivos** (during lifetime), or
- By **will**.

---

## Section 15: Valid Adoption Not to Be Cancelled

### General Rule - Irrevocability

No adoption which has been **validly made** can be cancelled by:

- The adoptive father or mother, or
- Any other person.

### Irrevocability

Nor can the adopted child **renounce his or her status** as such and return to the family of his or her birth.

**Key Point**: Once an adoption is validly made, it is **irrevocable** and cannot be cancelled.
