# Hindu Minority and Guardianship

## Introduction

The concept of minority and guardianship holds significant importance in Hindu law, governing the rights and responsibilities of minors within the Hindu community. The **Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956**, which came into force on **August 25, 1956**.

---

## Definition (Section 4)

### 1. Minor

**Section 4(a)** of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956, defines a minor as a person who has not attained the age of **eighteen years**.

### 2. Guardian

A guardian is defined under **Section 4(b)** of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956, as a person who is responsible for the property and well-being of a minor.

## Kinds of Guardian (Section 6)

### 1. Natural Guardian

**Section 6** of the Act deals with the natural guardianship of a Hindu minor. It provides that the natural guardians of a Hindu minor, in respect of the minor's person as well as in respect of the minor's property (excluding the minor's undivided interest in joint family property), are the **father and, after him, the mother**.

This section establishes the order of natural guardianship, prioritizing the father and then the mother.

#### Father

- Initially, the father is the natural guardian of a minor, whether a boy or an unmarried girl
- If the father is absent or unable to fulfill this role, the mother assumes guardianship
- However, if the father is alive and capable, he retains the primary right to guardianship
- This right extends until the child reaches the age of five, after which the mother may assume guardianship if the father is unable to fulfill the role

#### Mother

- The mother becomes the natural guardian in cases involving illegitimate boys or unmarried girls
- Even if the father is alive, the mother has precedence in guardianship for such children
- This right persists regardless of the mother's marital status or religious affiliation
- Additionally, in certain circumstances, such as when the parents are estranged or living separately, the mother may act as the natural guardian, as interpreted by the courts

#### Husband

A husband is recognized as the guardian of his minor wife. This implies that in cases where a girl is married before reaching the age of majority, her husband assumes the role of her natural guardian.

### 2. Testamentary Guardians (Section 9)

**Section 9** of the Act allows a Hindu father, by will, to appoint a testamentary guardian for his minor children. This provision enables a Hindu father to nominate a guardian for his minor children in case of his demise, ensuring continuity of care and protection.

#### Appointment by Will

According to Section 9 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, testamentary guardians can only be appointed through a will. This provision allows parents to designate a guardian for their minor children in the event of their demise.

#### Ceasing of Guardianship

The guardianship of a minor girl appointed by testamentary means ceases upon her marriage. This termination is absolute and does not revive even if she becomes a widow while still a minor.

#### Acceptance of Guardianship

It is essential for a testamentary guardian to accept the guardianship, which can be done explicitly or implicitly. Once accepted, the guardian cannot refuse to act or resign without the court's permission.

#### Testamentary Power of Both Parents

The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act now empowers both parents to appoint testamentary guardians. However, if one parent survives and appoints a testamentary guardian, their appointment takes precedence over the appointment made by the deceased parent.

#### Effect on Illegitimate Children

There seems to be a limitation regarding the testamentary appointment of guardians for illegitimate children. Section 9(1) grants this power to the father for legitimate children, but there is no similar provision for illegitimate children. However, Section 9(4) grants such power to the mother alone for illegitimate children.

### 3. Guardians Appointed by the Court

#### Appointment by Court

If the court deems it necessary for the welfare of a minor, it may appoint a guardian for the minor's person or property or both under the **Guardians and Wards Act, 1890**. The paramount consideration in such appointments is the welfare of the minor.

#### Supplementary Nature of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act

The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956, is complementary to the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, rather than superseding it. This means that while the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act provides guidelines for guardianship within the Hindu community, the Guardians and Wards Act governs the procedures and powers of guardians appointed by the court.

#### Certificated Guardian

A guardian appointed by the court is referred to as a **certificated guardian**. The powers of such a guardian are regulated by the Guardians and Wards Act. Typically, a certificated guardian requires prior permission from the court for most actions concerning the minor. However, the guardian's powers, albeit requiring court permission, are extensive and equivalent to those of a sovereign.

#### Supervision by the Court

Once appointed, a certificated guardian operates under the supervision, guidance, and control of the court. This ensures that the welfare of the minor remains a priority and that the guardian's actions are in the best interest of the minor.

Overall, the appointment of a guardian by the court ensures that minors receive proper care and protection, with the court overseeing and regulating the actions of the guardian to safeguard the minor's interests.

### Guardianship of a Minor Widow (Guardianship by Affinity)

According to Narada, when a minor girl becomes a widow, the husband's relatives have the duty to protect and maintain her. If in the husband's family no one is there, then the father of the widow takes on the responsibilities of the widow to protect her. Before 1956, there was a guardian called guardianship by affinity. It was the guardian of a minor widow, which was given by the Guardianship and Wards Act, 1850. No provision is given under the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956, for the guardianship of a minor widow.

#### Guardian by Affinity

In pre-1956 Hindu law, there existed a guardian known as the guardian by affinity, who was responsible for the welfare of a minor widow. This guardian was typically a relative of the deceased husband within the degree of sapinda.

#### Preference of Guardian

According to Mayne, the husband's relatives within the degree of sapinda were preferred as guardians of a minor widow over her own father and his relatives.

#### Legal Interpretations

Legal interpretations varied regarding the rightful guardian of a minor widow. The Allahabad High Court, in the case of **Paras Nath v. State (1960)**, held that the father-in-law was the rightful guardian of a minor widow. However, other courts, such as the Nagpur High Court and the Madras High Court, did not adopt this view. They emphasized that the welfare of the child should be the primary consideration in appointing a guardian, rather than merely following traditional preferences.

#### Paramount Consideration in Modern Law

Under Section 13 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, the welfare of the child is explicitly stated as the paramount consideration in appointing any person as a guardian. While traditional preferences may be considered, they are secondary to the child's welfare.

### 4. De Facto Guardian

#### De Facto Guardian Definition

A de facto guardian is a person who, although not legally recognized as a guardian, assumes the management of a Hindu minor's property as if they were a guardian. They do not have legal authority to act as a guardian but have taken on the responsibilities of managing the minor's property.

#### Legal Prohibition

**Section 11** of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act explicitly prohibits a de facto guardian from disposing of or dealing with the property of a Hindu minor based solely on their status as a de facto guardian. This means that their actions regarding the minor's property are not legally valid solely on the grounds of their de facto guardianship.

#### Historical Recognition

The concept of de facto guardianship has roots in Hindu law dating back to at least 1856. The Privy Council, in the case of **Hanuman Prasad Singh v. Bhaguati Prasad Singh**, recognized the rights of bona fide incumbrancers who had entered into arrangements with de facto guardians for the benefit of the estate.

#### Controversy and Limitations

While de facto guardians may take on responsibilities for managing a minor's property, they do not possess the legal authority to assume debts, gift the minor's property, or make references to arbitration. Their status and actions are subject to legal scrutiny and limitations as outlined in the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act.

De facto guardians may play a role in managing a minor's property, their actions are not legally binding solely based on their de facto status. Section 11 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act prohibits them from disposing of or dealing with the minor's property without proper legal authority.

---

### 5. Ad Hoc Guardian

The term **'ad hoc'** means "for this purpose." An ad hoc guardian is appointed for a specific purpose or transaction, unlike a de facto guardian who assumes a continuous role in managing the minor's affairs. Before a person can be described as a de facto guardian, there must be a course of conduct in that capacity, implying some continuity of conduct and management of the property beyond an isolated act.

A person who has never intermeddled or acted as a guardian over many years cannot come forward and claim to be a de facto guardian authorised to sell property on behalf of a minor. Such a person would be a guardian ad hoc, not a de facto guardian.

## Powers of the Guardian

The powers and limitations of a natural guardian under **Section 8** of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956.

### Compulsory and Beneficial Acts

A natural guardian of a Hindu minor has the authority to perform acts that are compulsory or beneficial for the minor's interests, including the protection and advancement of the minor's condition.

### Permission for Certain Actions

Prior permission from the court is required for the natural guardian to utilize gifts, mortgage property, or engage in other significant transactions involving the minor's property.

### Leasing of Property

Permission from the court is necessary for leasing any part of the minor's property for periods exceeding **five years** or extending beyond the minor's attainment of majority by one year.

### Validity of Disposal

Any disposal of immovable property by a natural guardian is subject to being voidable at the minor's or their representative's discretion if it is determined not to be in the minor's best interest.

### Court's Oversight

The court is tasked with ensuring that the actions of the natural guardian are in the best interest of the minor. Permission from the court is required for actions that could potentially harm the minor's interests.

### Application Procedure

Applications for permission from the court are governed by the **Guardians and Wards Act, 1890**. The natural guardian must apply to the appropriate court within whose jurisdiction the minor's property is located.

### Appeals

If permission for certain acts is denied by the court, the natural guardian has the option to appeal the decision, although the court's decision is typically final unless appealed successfully.

### Right to Custody

## Welfare of the Minor (Section 13)

**Section 13** emphasizes that in appointing or declaring a guardian of a minor, the **welfare of the minor shall be the paramount consideration**.

This section underscores the principle that the best interests of the minor should guide decisions related to guardianship.

## Case Laws

> **📌 Githa Hariharan v. Reserve Bank of India (1999)**
>
> In this landmark case, the Supreme Court held that the mother can act as the natural guardian of her minor children, exercising the same rights and responsibilities as the father. This decision marked a significant departure from traditional Hindu law, recognizing the mother's equal status as a natural guardian.

> **📌 Jijabai Babasaheb Patil v. Additional District Judge (2003)**
>
> The Bombay High Court ruled that in cases where the father is absent or incapable of acting as the natural guardian, the mother can be appointed as the guardian of the minor's property under Section 8 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956. This judgment reaffirmed the principle of prioritizing the welfare of the minor while determining guardianship.

> **📌 Essakkayal Nadder Vs. Sreedharan Babu (AIR 1992 KER 200)**
>
> In this case, the mother of the minor died, and the father was also not living with the child, but the child was alive. The child was not declared to be a Hindu or to have renounced the world, and he was also not declared unfit. These facts do not authorize that any other person adopt the child, be the natural guardian, and transfer the property.

> **📌 Smt. Beti Bai Vs. Jagdish Singh and Ors (Civil Appeal No. 20A/2001)**
>
> Aparbal Singh was the father of plaintiff, who is no more. Aparbal Singh had 2 wives because, during his lifetime his first wife died due to some problem, then his second wife came to his life who was the respondent. And the child of the second wife also died due to some reason. At last after the Aparbal Singh died, the second wife captured all the property then the son of the first wife filed a complaint.

## Conclusion

Indeed, the institution of guardianship plays a crucial role in ensuring the welfare and protection of minors, as well as managing their property and affairs. Guardianship laws are designed to safeguard the rights and interests of minors who are not yet capable of making decisions for themselves. By appointing a guardian, whether natural or court-appointed, the law aims to provide a responsible individual who can act in the best interests of the minor, both personally and financially.

The relationship between a guardian and a minor involves not only physical and mental protection but also the management and preservation of the minor's property. This is particularly important to prevent any exploitation or misuse of the minor's assets. Guardianship laws outline the duties and responsibilities of guardians, ensuring that they act in the minor's best interests and do not abuse their authority.

Additionally, laws regarding the adoption of children further reinforce the protective measures in place for minors. Adoption provides a legal framework for establishing a permanent parent-child relationship, ensuring that the child receives care, support, and stability within a family environment. Overall, the existence of guardianship laws and adoption regulations underscores society's commitment to safeguarding the rights and well-being of minors, providing them with the necessary protection and support until they reach adulthood.
