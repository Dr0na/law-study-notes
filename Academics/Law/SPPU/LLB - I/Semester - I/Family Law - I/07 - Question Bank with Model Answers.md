### Q2. Distinguish between void and voidable marriages under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. (10 marks)

**MODEL ANSWER:**

**Introduction (1 mark)**
The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 recognizes two types of invalid marriages - void marriages (Section 11) and voidable marriages (Section 12). Understanding the distinction is crucial for determining legal consequences.

**Main Body (8 marks)**

|--------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Nature** | No marriage from beginning | Valid until avoided |
| **Who can avoid** | Either party (or declaratory suit) | Only parties to marriage |
| **Effect if not avoided** | Always void | Remains valid |
| **After death** | Can be challenged | Cannot be challenged |
| **Legal consequences** | None | All consequences flow until avoided |
| **Retrospective effect** | Always void | Void from date of marriage if avoided |
| **Children** | Legitimate (Section 16) | Legitimate if begotten/conceived before decree |
| **Grounds** | Section 5(i), (iv), (v) | Section 12(1)(a), (b), (c), (d) |
