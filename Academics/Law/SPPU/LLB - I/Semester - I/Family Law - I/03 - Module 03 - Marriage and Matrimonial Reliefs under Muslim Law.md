## 📌 UNIT 1: MUSLIM MARRIAGE (NIKAH)

### 🧠 MASTER STRUCTURED NOTES

#### 1. Definition and Nature of Nikah

**📌 Definition**
- **Not a sacrament** (unlike Hindu marriage)
- **Civil contract** between man and woman
- **Ibadat** (devotional act)
- **Sunnat** (practice of Prophet)
- **Wajib** (obligatory) for physically fit Muslims

**⚖️ Key Principle**
- Singlehood, monasticism, celibacy = **FORBIDDEN**
- Prophet said: "He who marries completes half his religion"
- Marriage equal to **jehad** (holy war)

---

#### 2. Essentials of Valid Marriage

**✅ Five Essentials**

1. **Proposal and Acceptance (Ijab and Qubul)**
   - Both at **one meeting** (essential)
   - Two male OR one male + two female witnesses
   - Witnesses must be sane, adult Muslims
   - Usual form: "I have married myself to you" / "I have consented"

2. **Capacity to Contract**
   - Sound mind + Puberty
   - **Puberty = Majority** (for marriage matters)
   - **Indian Majority Act, 1875**: Does NOT apply to marriage, dower, divorce
   - Hanafi: Presumed at 15 years
   - Shia Female: Begins with menstruation
   - **Case**: Shafin Jahan v. Asokan K.M. (2018) - 16-year-old Muslim girl's marriage held valid

3. **Guardianship (Jabar)**
   - **Sunni Order**: Father → Paternal Grandfather → Brother → Mother → Others → Government
   - **Shia**: Only Father + Paternal Grandfather (others ineffective unless ratified)
   - **Option of Puberty**: Minor can ratify/repudiate on attaining puberty
   - **Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939 Section 2(vii)**: Wife entitled to dissolution if married before 15, repudiated before 18, not consummated

4. **Absence of Impediments**
   - No absolute impediments (void)
   - No relative impediments (invalid)

5. **Formalities**
   - No prescribed ceremonies
   - Customary practices (not essential): Nikah by Kazi, Exchange of gifts, Prayers
   - Registration NOT compulsory

---

#### 3. Impediments to Marriage

**🚫 Absolute Impediments (Batil - Void)**

1. **Polyandry**: Married woman cannot have second husband
2. **Consanguinity**: Blood relationship
   - Ascendants (mother, grandmother)
   - Descendants (daughter, granddaughter)
   - Second rank (brothers, sisters, descendants)
   - Uncles and aunts (paternal/maternal)
3. **Affinity**: Relationship by marriage
   - Wife's mother/grandmother (how highsoever)
   - Wife's daughter/granddaughter (if consummated)
   - Father's wife (or ascendant's wife)
   - Son's wife (or descendant's wife)
4. **Fosterage**: Relationship by suckling
   - Act of suckling = Act of procreation
   - Same effect as consanguinity

**⚠️ Relative Impediments (Fasid - Invalid)**

1. **Fifth wife**: Marriage with 5th wife (invalid)
   - Remedy: Divorce one of the four wives

2. **Absence of witnesses**: No proper witnesses
   - Shia: NOT required
   - Remedy: Subsequent confirmation in presence of witnesses

3. **Difference of religion**:
   - **Shia**: Both must be Muslim
   - **Sunni**: 
     - Muslim male + Kitabia (Christian/Jewish) = Valid
     - Muslim male + Idolatress = Irregular (can be removed by conversion)
     - Muslim female + Non-Muslim = **VOID**

4. **Unlawful conjunction**: Two wives related (e.g., sisters)
   - Remedy: Divorce one OR death of either

5. **Woman in iddat**: Marriage during iddat period

**⚖️ Difference: Batil vs Fasid**

| Aspect | Batil (Void) | Fasid (Invalid) |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Nature** | Altogether illegal | Good foundation, unlawful attributes |
| **Rights Before Consummation** | None | None |
| **Rights After Consummation** | None (except customary dower) | Some rights |
| **Dower** | No dower (or customary if consummated) | Proper or specified (whichever less) |
| **Children** | Illegitimate | Legitimate |
| **Iddat** | No iddat | Wife bound to observe iddat |
| **Mutual Inheritance** | No | No (same as Batil) |

---

**📊 Disabilities of Wife**
- Cannot divorce herself (except by court decree)
- Monogamy (cannot have more than one husband)

**📖 Meaning of Talaq**

- **Quranic Position**: Allah discourages divorce, encourages continuation
- **Exception**: If disputes cannot be resolved, Quran provides procedure
- **Revocation**: Procedure allows possibility of revocation

**📊 Three Kinds**

1. **Talaq-ul-Sunnat** (Revocable)
   - **Talaq-Ahsan**: Single pronouncement in Tuhr, no revocation during iddat

2. **Talaq-ul-Bidaat** (Irrevocable)
