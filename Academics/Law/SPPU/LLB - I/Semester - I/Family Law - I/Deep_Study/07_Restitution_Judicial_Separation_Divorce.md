## 🔍 Introduction

## 📚 PART I: RESTITUTION OF CONJUGAL RIGHTS [Section 9]

### **SECTION 9: Restitution of Conjugal Rights**

**Complete Text:**
"When either the husband or the wife has, without reasonable excuse, withdrawn from the society of the other, the aggrieved party may apply, by petition to the district court, for restitution of conjugal rights and the court, on being satisfied of the truth of the statements made in such petition and that there is no legal ground why the application should not be granted, may decree restitution of conjugal rights accordingly."

---

### **A. CONCEPT AND NATURE**

- Right to consortium (companionship)

**Objective:**

#### **If Decree Not Complied:**
If restitution decree not obeyed for **ONE YEAR** from date of decree:
- Becomes ground for **divorce** [Section 13(1A)(ii)]
- Becomes ground for **judicial separation** [Section 10]

**Section 13(1A)(ii):**
"there has been no restitution of conjugal rights as between the parties to the marriage for a period of one year or upwards after the passing of a decree for restitution of conjugal rights in a proceeding to which they were parties"

### **E. CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDITY**

Section 9 has been challenged as violating fundamental rights:

#### **Challenge Grounds:**
- Violates **Article 21** (Right to Privacy)
- Violates **Article 14** (Equality)
- Infringes on personal liberty and dignity
- Amounts to "marital rape"

#### **Andhra Pradesh High Court:**
**T. Sareetha v. T. Venkata Subbaiah** AIR 1983 AP 356
- Struck down Section 9 as unconstitutional
- Violates privacy, dignity, freedom under Article 21

- Upheld Section 9 as constitutional
- Promotes reconciliation

#### **3. Moonshee Buzloor Ruheem v. Shumsoonissa Begum** (1867) 11 MIA 551
**Held:**
- Withdrawal means abandonment of cohabitation

---

### **G. MODERN RELEVANCE**

**Criticism:**
- Rarely leads to actual reconciliation
- Often used as stepping stone to divorce
- May cause further bitterness
- Questioned on human rights grounds

**Practical Use:**
- Parties often don't comply with decree
- After 1 year non-compliance, divorce sought
- Effectively prolongs inevitable divorce

### **D. DIFFERENCE: JUDICIAL SEPARATION vs DIVORCE**

---

### **E. PRACTICAL USE**

## 🎓 KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER

### **Restitution:**
- Compels resumption of cohabitation
- If not complied for 1 year → divorce ground
- Constitutionally valid

### **Judicial Separation:**
- Marriage continues, no cohabitation
- Same grounds as divorce
- After 1 year → divorce ground
- Rarely used

### **Divorce:**
- Complete dissolution
- **9 common grounds** + **2 additional (1A)** + **4 for wife only** = **15 grounds total**
- **Mutual consent** most popular (Section 13B)
- 1976 Amendment liberalized divorce

### **Irretrievable Breakdown:**
- Not explicit ground
- Judicially recognized under cruelty and Article 142

### **Cruelty Most Common:**
- Physical + mental
- Subjective + objective test
- Includes wide range of conduct
