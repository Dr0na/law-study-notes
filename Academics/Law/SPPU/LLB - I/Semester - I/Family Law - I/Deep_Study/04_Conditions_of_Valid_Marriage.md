### **THE 7 ESSENTIAL CONDITIONS:**

---

## 1️⃣ CONDITION 1: NO LIVING SPOUSE [Section 5(i)]

### **Text of Provision:**
"Neither party has a spouse living at the time of marriage"

### **Explanation:**
This condition mandates **monogamy** in Hindu marriage.

### **Legal Requirements:**
- Both parties must be **unmarried** at time of marriage, OR
- If previously married, prior marriage must have been dissolved by:
  - **Divorce**, OR
  - **Death** of former spouse, OR

### **Consequence of Violation:**
Marriage is **VOID** under Section 11.

### **Criminal Consequences:**

- Punishment: **7 years imprisonment** and/or fine
- **IPC Section 495** if fraud involved (concealing former marriage)

### **Illustrations:**

**Illustration 1:**
A (male) marries B (female). Without divorcing B, A marries C. Marriage between A and C is **void** as A has living spouse B.

**Illustration 2:**
A marries B. B dies. A then marries C. This marriage is **valid** as B is no longer living.

**Illustration 3:**
A marries B. They get divorced by decree. A marries C. This marriage is **valid** as first marriage dissolved.

### **Exception:**
**Custom may permit polygamy** - If parties are governed by custom permitting polygamy, second marriage may be valid under customary law (though this is extremely rare and courts are reluctant to recognize such customs in modern times).

### **Important Case Laws:**

#### **Sarla Mudgal v. Union of India** (1995) 3 SCC 635
**Facts:** Hindu husband converted to Islam and married second wife without divorcing first wife.

Self → Father (excluded) → Grandfather (1) → Great-grandfather (2) → GG-Grandfather (3)
= 3 degrees through father
```

**Example (Mother's Line):**
```
Self → Mother (excluded) → Maternal Grandfather (1) → Mat. Great-GF (2) → Mat. GG-GF (3) → Mat. GGG-GF (4) → Mat. GGGG-GF (5)
= 5 degrees through mother
```

Marriage between following sapindas is **prohibited**:

#### **Through Father (within 3 degrees):**
- Self and Father's sister (Aunt)
- Self and Father's mother (Grandmother)
