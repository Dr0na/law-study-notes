# 📘 SCHOOLS OF HINDU LAW (Deep Study)

---

### C. KEY PRINCIPLES OF MITAKSHARA SCHOOL

#### 1. **COPARCENARY CONCEPT**

**Definition:**
Coparcenary is a narrower body than joint family. It consists of male lineal descendants within **four degrees** from common ancestor.

**Who are Coparceners:**
- Under classical Mitakshara: **Only males**
  - Son
  - Grandson
  - Great-grandson
  - Great-great-grandson

**Important Change:**
Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 made **daughters coparceners** equal to sons.

**Illustration:**
A (Propositus) → B (Son) → C (Grandson) → D (Great-grandson) → E (Great-great-grandson)

A, B, C, D, E form coparcenary. E's son cannot be coparcener with A (exceeds 4 degrees).

---

#### 2. **BIRTH RIGHT**

**Principle:**
Under Mitakshara, a son acquires an **interest by birth** in ancestral (coparcenary) property.

**Significance:**
- No act of father required to confer right
- Son becomes coparcener immediately upon birth
- Father cannot alienate coparcenary property without son's consent (except for legal necessity or benefit of estate)

**Case Law:**
**Suraj Narain v. Iqbal Narain** AIR 1953 All 221
- Court held son's birthright in coparcenary property cannot be defeated by father's alienation without legal necessity

---

#### 3. **SURVIVORSHIP (DOCTRINE OF SURVIVAL)**

**Principle:**
On death of a coparcener, his share does not pass by succession but by **survivorship** to surviving coparceners.

**Rule:**
Interest of deceased coparcener expands and merges with shares of surviving coparceners.

**Exception:**
If coparcener leaves behind:
- Widow
- Mother
- Daughter
- Daughter's son

These relatives inherit (not by survivorship but as Class I heirs under Hindu Succession Act, 1956).

**Illustration:**
A and his three sons B, C, D are coparceners. D dies without leaving Class I heirs. D's 1/4 share merges with shares of A, B, and C by survivorship.

---

#### 4. **JOINT FAMILY PROPERTY**

**Types of Property:**

##### a) **Ancestral/Coparcenary Property**
- Property inherited from father, grandfather, or great-grandfather
- All coparceners have birthright
- Cannot be alienated without consent (except legal necessity)

##### b) **Self-Acquired/Separate Property**
- Property acquired by individual's own efforts
- Property received through will, gift, or partition
- Full ownership rights; can alienate freely

**Illustration:**
A inherits property from his grandfather. This is ancestral property for A's sons. But if A purchases land from his salary, it is A's self-acquired property.

---

#### 5. **PARTITION**

**Definition:**
Partition is severance of joint status and division of joint family property.

**Types:**
- **Partial Partition:** Some coparceners separate
- **Total Partition:** Complete disruption of joint family

**Effect:**
- Coparcenary status ends
- Property divided per capita (by headcount)
- Each coparcener gets definite share

**Rights:**
Any coparcener can demand partition as matter of right.

---

### D. INHERITANCE RULES (MITAKSHARA)

**Order of Succession:**

1. **First Preference:** Surviving coparceners (by survivorship)
2. **Second Preference:** Heirs under Hindu Succession Act, 1956
   - Class I Heirs
   - Class II Heirs
   - Agnates
   - Cognates

**Special Rules:**
- Preference to male heirs historically
- 2005 Amendment gave daughters equal rights

---

## 📚 II. DAYABHAGA SCHOOL

### A. BASIC INFORMATION

**Name Origin:**
- "Dayabhaga" means "Division of Inheritance"

**Author:**
- **Jimutavahana** (12th Century CE)
- Scholar from Bengal region

**Text Basis:**
- Original treatise (not a commentary)
- Focused primarily on inheritance law

**Geographical Application:**
- **Bengal** (West Bengal)
- **Assam**
- Parts of Odisha

**Fundamental Difference:**
Dayabhaga rejects Mitakshara's doctrine of birthright and survivorship.

---

### B. KEY PRINCIPLES OF DAYABHAGA SCHOOL

#### 1. **NO BIRTH RIGHT**

**Principle:**
Sons do **NOT** acquire any interest in father's property during father's lifetime merely by birth.

**Significance:**
- Father has absolute ownership of property
- Father can alienate property freely without son's consent
- Sons inherit only after father's death

**Contrast with Mitakshara:**
- **Mitakshara:** Son has birthright
- **Dayabhaga:** Son has only right to inherit (spes successionis)

**Illustration:**
Under Dayabhaga, if father sells all his property during lifetime, sons have no legal remedy as they had no present interest.

---

#### 2. **SUCCESSION, NOT SURVIVORSHIP**

**Principle:**
Property passes by **succession** (inheritance) upon death, not by survivorship.

**Significance:**
- Deceased's share distributed among his heirs
- Follows rules of succession
- Surviving coparceners don't automatically take deceased's share

**Contrast with Mitakshara:**
- **Mitakshara:** Share passes by survivorship to coparceners
- **Dayabhaga:** Share passes by succession to heirs

**Illustration:**
A, B (son), C (son) form joint family. B dies leaving widow W and daughter D. Under Dayabhaga, B's share passes to W and D by succession, not to A and C.

---

#### 3. **SAPINDA RELATIONSHIP**

**Definition:**
Sapinda means "connected by particles of the same body."

**Scope:**
Relationship through offering of *pinda* (rice balls) in funeral ceremonies.

**Extent:**
- Through father: Up to **7 degrees**
- Through mother: Up to **5 degrees**

**Significance:**
Sapinda relationship determines:
- Who can inherit
- Marriage prohibitions

**Illustration:**
A's son's son's son (great-grandson) is sapinda to A within 7 degrees.

---

#### 4. **ORDER OF SUCCESSION (DAYABHAGA)**

Dayabhaga has its own distinctive order of succession:

##### **First Preference:** Sapindas (Blood Relations)
- Son, grandson, great-grandson
- Daughter, daughter's son
- Widow, mother

##### **Second Preference:** Sakulyas (Cognates)
- Relations beyond sapinda degree but within 14 generations

##### **Third Preference:** Spiritual Teacher (Guru)

##### **Fourth Preference:** Disciple (Shishya)

##### **Fifth Preference:** King (State)

**Important:**
After Hindu Succession Act, 1956, this order is largely superseded by statutory order (Class I, Class II, Agnates, Cognates).

---

#### 5. **PROPERTY DIVISION**

**Rule:**
Division is **per capita** (by head count) among heirs.

**No Doctrine of Representation:**
Classical Dayabhaga didn't recognize representation (though modern law does).

**Father's Authority:**
- Father has complete control over property during lifetime
- Can gift, sell, or bequeath
- Sons have no say

---

### C. WIDOW'S POSITION (DAYABHAGA)

**Better Position than Mitakshara:**
- Widow inherits as heir
- Gets share equal to son's share
- Has limited ownership (not absolute in classical law)

**Restrictions (Historically):**
- Could not alienate property without necessity
- Property reverted to husband's heirs after her death

**Modern Law:**
Hindu Succession Act, 1956 gives widow absolute rights as Class I heir.
