# 📘 VOID AND VOIDABLE MARRIAGES (Deep Study)

## 🔍 Introduction

Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 makes a clear distinction between **void marriages** (Section 11) and **voidable marriages** (Section 12). Understanding this distinction is crucial as it determines legal consequences, rights of parties, and legitimacy of children.

---

## 📚 FUNDAMENTAL DISTINCTION

### **Void Marriage:**
- Marriage is **null and void ab initio** (from the beginning)
- No legal existence in eyes of law
- Creates no rights or obligations
- Decree of nullity merely declares existing position
- No formal decree necessary for marriage to be void

### **Voidable Marriage:**
- Marriage is **valid until annulled** by court
- Has legal existence until decree of nullity
- Creates rights and obligations until annulled
- Requires decree of court to set aside
- Cannot be questioned after death of either party (generally)

---

## 🚫 VOID MARRIAGES (Section 11)

### **Section 11: Void Marriages**

**Complete Text:**
"Any marriage solemnized after the commencement of this Act shall be null and void and may, on a petition presented by either party thereto against the other party, be so declared by a decree of nullity if it contravenes any one of the conditions specified in clauses (i), (iv) and (v) of section 5."
