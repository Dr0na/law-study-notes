5. **Fifth Step:** Progeny and children
6. **Sixth Step:** Longevity and seasons
7. **Seventh Step:** Friendship and companionship

**SIGNIFICANCE:**

**1. Completion Point:**

- Most sacred part of ceremony

**3. Mutual Vows:**
- Both parties take steps together
- Symbolizes equal partnership

- Statutory recognition in Section 7(2)
- Completion point legally defined
- No ambiguity about when marriage complete

**CASE LAW:**
**Chhaganlal Govindlal v. Municipal Corporation of Delhi (AIR 1964 SC 1411):** Saptapadi is completion point where it forms part of ceremony.

**CONSEQUENCE:**
If Saptapadi is essential custom and not performed, marriage may be void.

## ❓ QUESTION 3

**Q3-MAR-5M:** Explain the provisions of Section 16 regarding legitimacy of children of void and voidable marriages.

### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

**INTRODUCTION:**
Section 16 of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 provides humanitarian protection to children born of void or voidable marriages by declaring them legitimate despite invalidity of parents' marriage, subject to certain conditions.

**SECTION 16: STATUTORY PROVISION:**

**Text:**
Children of void or voidable marriages are legitimate if:
1. Marriage was null and void OR annulled by decree of nullity, AND
2. Child was **conceived before decree** of nullity, AND
3. At time of intercourse leading to conception:
   - Parties did not know of facts making marriage void, OR
   - (In case of voidable marriage) Before decree of nullity

**RATIONALE:**

**Protection of Innocent Children:**
- Children should not suffer for parents' invalid marriage
- Not responsible for marriage defects
- Right to dignity and rights

**Social Justice:**
- Prevent stigma of illegitimacy
- Ensure children's welfare
- Humanitarian approach

**RIGHTS OF LEGITIMATE CHILDREN:**

Children declared legitimate under Section 16 have right to:
1. **Maintenance** from parents
2. **Succession** to parents' property
3. Social recognition
4. Benefits under other laws

**IMPORTANT LIMITATION:**
Children have rights only to **parents' property**, NOT to property of other relatives (grandparents, uncles, etc.).

**RATIONALE FOR LIMITATION:**
- Other relatives not party to invalid marriage
- Should not be burdened
- Protection extends only to immediate parents

**ILLUSTRATION:**
A marries B (marriage void - A had living spouse). Child C born. C is legitimate under Section 16 and can inherit from A and B, but NOT from A's or B's other relatives.

**CASE LAW:**
Courts liberally interpret Section 16 to protect children's interests.

**CONDITIONS ANALYZED:**

**"Conceived before decree":**
If child conceived after decree of nullity, not covered by Section 16.

**"Did not know facts":**
Protects parties who entered marriage in good faith, unaware of impediment.

**Voidable Exception:**
For voidable marriages, protection applies if child conceived before decree (knowledge less relevant as marriage was valid until decree).

**CONCLUSION:**
Section 16 represents legislative compassion, ensuring children of void/voidable marriages are not penalized for circumstances beyond their control. By granting legitimacy with limited rights to parents' property, law balances protection of children with rights of other family members, demonstrating humane approach to complex matrimonial situations.
