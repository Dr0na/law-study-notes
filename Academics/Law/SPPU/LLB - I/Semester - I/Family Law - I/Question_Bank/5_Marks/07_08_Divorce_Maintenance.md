## ❓ QUESTION 1

**Q1-DIV-5M:** Discuss desertion as a ground for divorce under Hindu Marriage Act.

### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

**INTRODUCTION:**
Desertion under Section 13(1)(ib) of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 is permanent abandonment of one spouse by other without reasonable cause and without consent for continuous period of not less than two years.

**STATUTORY PROVISION:**
"has deserted the petitioner for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition"

**FIVE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS:**

**Mnemonic: "FASAC"**

1. **Factum of Separation:** Actual physical living apart
2. **Animus Deserendi:** Intention to permanently end marital relationship
3. **Sans Consent:** Without consent or against will of deserted spouse
4. **Absence of Reasonable Cause:** No justification for leaving
5. **Continuous 2 Years:** Immediately preceding petition, without substantial resumption

**TYPES:**

**A. Actual/Physical Desertion:**
- Physically leaving matrimonial home
- Living in different place
- No contact or communication

**B. Constructive Desertion:**
- Not physically leaving
- But withdrawing from all marital obligations
- Making life so unbearable that other is forced to leave

**REASONABLE CAUSES (Defenses):**
If respondent left due to:
- Cruelty by petitioner
- Adultery by petitioner
- Lack of maintenance
- Ill-treatment

Then it is NOT desertion (reasonable cause exists).

**MUTUAL SEPARATION:**
If both agree to live separately, not desertion (consent exists).

**CASE LAWS:**

**Moonshee Buzloor Ruheem v. Shumsoonissa Begum (1867):**
- Classic definition of desertion
- Withdrawal from society without reasonable cause and without consent

**Bipinchandra v. Prabhavati (AIR 1957 SC 176):**
- Desertion is total repudiation of marital obligations
- Withdrawal from consortium

**Lachman Utamchand Kirpalani v. Meena (AIR 1964 SC 40):**
- Animus deserendi (intention to desert) essential
- Mere living apart insufficient

**ILLUSTRATION:**
Husband leaves wife in January 2020 and moves to another city without communication or sending maintenance. Wife can file divorce petition in February 2022 (after 2 years continuous desertion).

**CONCLUSION:**
Desertion as ground for divorce requires both factual separation and intention to desert for continuous 2-year period without consent or reasonable cause. Both physical and mental elements must coexist throughout the period.

## ❓ QUESTION 2

**Q2-DIV-5M:** Explain adultery as a ground for divorce under Section 13(1)(i).

### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

**INTRODUCTION:**
Adultery under Section 13(1)(i) of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 is a matrimonial offense constituting ground for divorce available to both spouses equally.

**STATUTORY PROVISION:**
"has, after the solemnization of the marriage, had voluntary sexual intercourse with any person other than his or her spouse"

**ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS (4):**

1. **Sexual Intercourse:**
   - Actual sexual intercourse necessary
   - Mere intention or proximity insufficient

2. **Voluntary:**
   - Must be voluntary (consensual)
   - If by force/rape, not adultery
   - Free will essential

3. **After Marriage:**
   - Must occur after solemnization of marriage
   - Pre-marital relations not covered (may be fraud though)

4. **With Person Other Than Spouse:**
   - With any third person
   - Irrespective of whether third person married or not

**SINGLE ACT SUFFICIENT:**
Even one act of adultery constitutes ground for divorce. Repetition not necessary.

**PROOF:**

**Direct Evidence:**
- Rarely available
- Confession (rare)
- Caught in act (uncommon)

**Circumstantial Evidence:**
- More common method of proof
- Opportunity + Inclination = Inference
- Suspicious circumstances
- Compromising situations

**Examples of Circumstantial Evidence:**
- Found together in bedroom/hotel
- Late night presence together
- Love letters, messages
- Gifts exchanged
- Photographs

**CASE LAW:**

**Smt. Jorden Diengdeh v. S.S. Chopra (AIR 1985 SC 935):**
- Adultery can be inferred from circumstances
- Direct proof not always necessary
- Strong evidence of opportunity and disposition sufficient for inference

**DEFENSES:**

**1. Condonation:**
- Forgiveness after knowledge
- Resumption of marital relations after knowing of adultery
- Bars relief

**2. Connivance:**
- Petitioner encouraged or consented to adultery
- Bars relief

**3. Collusion:**
- Fabricated adultery to obtain divorce
- Not permitted

**GENDER EQUALITY:**
Before 1976 Amendment, adultery ground available differently to husband and wife. **1976 Amendment equalized** - now both spouses have equal right to seek divorce on this ground.

**ILLUSTRATION:**
Wife discovers husband having sexual relations with another woman. Even single act proven is sufficient ground for divorce under Section 13(1)(i).

**CONCLUSION:**
Adultery as ground for divorce reflects that fidelity is fundamental to marriage. Provable by circumstantial evidence and requiring only single act, it provides effective remedy for spouse betrayed by other's infidelity.

## ❓ QUESTION 3

**Q3-MAINT-5M:** Compare maintenance under Section 24 and Section 25 of Hindu Marriage Act.

### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

**INTRODUCTION:**
Hindu Marriage Act provides two types of maintenance: Section 24 (pendente lite - during proceedings) and Section 25 (permanent alimony - after decree). Both aim to provide financial security but differ in timing, nature, and effect.

**SECTION 24: MAINTENANCE PENDENTE LITE**

**Nature:** Temporary/Interim maintenance

**When:** During pendency of matrimonial proceedings

**Covers:**
1. Litigation expenses (court fees, lawyer fees)
2. Monthly maintenance during proceedings

**Duration:** Until final decree or death/remarriage

**Time:** Application disposed within **60 days** target

**SECTION 25: PERMANENT ALIMONY**

**Nature:** Post-decree financial support

**When:** At time of or after decree (divorce, nullity, JS, restitution)

**Forms:**
1. Lump sum (one-time)
2. Monthly/periodical
3. Secured by property charge

**Duration:** For term not exceeding life of applicant

**COMPARATIVE TABLE:**

| **Aspect** | **Section 24** | **Section 25** |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Stage** | During proceedings | After decree |
| **Nature** | Interim | Permanent |
| **Covers** | Litigation + Monthly | Alimony |
| **Time** | 60-day target | No specific limit |
| **Duration** | Till final decree | Life of applicant (max) |
| **Quantum** | 25-33% (guideline) | 33% (guideline) |
| **Modification** | Based on circumstances | Yes [25(2)] |
| **Termination** | On final decree | Remarriage [25(3)] |

**COMMON FACTORS (RICO):**
Both sections consider:
- **R**espondent's income/property
- **I**ncome/property of applicant
- **C**onduct of parties
- **O**ther circumstances

**WHO CAN CLAIM:**
Both sections are gender-neutral - either spouse can claim if lacking sufficient income.

**QUANTUM GUIDELINES:**
- Section 24: Often 25-33% of net income
- Section 25: Often 33% of net income
- (Guidelines only, not rigid rules)

**CASE LAWS:**
- **Chaturbhuj v. Sita Bai (1970):** Section 24 remedial; liberal construction
- **Jasbir Kaur Sehgal v. District Judge (1997):** No fixed formula; fair and reasonable
- **Shamima Farooqui (2015):** Should enable dignified living

**PRACTICAL INTERACTION:**
Section 24 maintenance ends when final decree passed. Section 25 alimony then becomes relevant if decree granted.

**CONCLUSION:**
Sections 24 and 25 provide comprehensive maintenance framework: interim support during litigation ensuring access to justice, and permanent support after decree ensuring financial security. Together they prevent destitution and enable both contest and post-decree life with dignity.

## ❓ QUESTION 4

**Q4-MAINT-5M:** Discuss the advantages of Section 125 CrPC over Hindu Marriage Act maintenance provisions.

### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

**INTRODUCTION:**
Section 125 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 provides criminal remedy for maintenance, offering several advantages over Hindu Marriage Act provisions (Sections 24-25) for wives seeking financial support.

**SECTION 125 CrPC - BASICS:**

**Who Can Claim:**
- Wife (including divorced wife)
- Children
- Parents

**Conditions for Wife:**
- Unable to maintain herself
- Husband has sufficient means
- Refuses/neglects to maintain

**ADVANTAGES OVER HMA PROVISIONS:**

**1. SPEED:**
- **Magistrate Court** (not District Court)
- **Summary procedure**
- Faster disposal (months vs years)
- Less procedural complexity

**2. NO DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS REQUIRED:**
- Can claim **during subsistence of marriage**
- No need to file divorce/judicial separation
- Independent remedy
- Immediate relief available

**3. ACCESSIBILITY:**
- Simple procedure
- Lower court fees
- Less intimidating than District Court
- More accessible to poor/rural women

**4. CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT:**
- **Arrest possible** for non-compliance
- Criminal contempt proceedings
- Stronger enforcement mechanism
- Compliance better assured

**5. NO UPPER LIMIT:**
- Since 2001 Amendment, **no maximum limit**
- Earlier: ₹500 per month limit
- Now: Any reasonable amount based on needs

**6. SPEEDY EXECUTION:**
- Recovered as fine
- Attachment of salary possible
- Criminal machinery available

**COMPARISON TABLE:**

| **Aspect** | **Sec 24/25 HMA** | **Sec 125 CrPC** |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| Court | District Court | Magistrate Court |
| Procedure | Civil | Criminal |
| Time | Slower | Faster |
| Divorce Needed | Yes (or pending) | No |
| Enforcement | Civil execution | Criminal (arrest) |
| Limit | None | None (since 2001) |

**DISADVANTAGES OF SECTION 125:**

1. Lower quantum compared to HMA (sometimes)
2. For wife only (men cannot claim)
3. Bars if living in adultery or refuses to live without reason

**INTERACTION WITH HMA:**

**Can Use Both:**
Wife can file:
- Section 125 for immediate interim relief
- HMA proceedings for comprehensive relief including divorce

**Adjustment:**
Amount granted under Section 125 may be adjusted against HMA maintenance to prevent double payment.

**STRATEGIC USE:**
Lawyers often advise:
- File Section 125 first (quick relief)
- Then file HMA divorce petition
- Section 125 provides interim support during lengthy HMA proceedings

**KEY CASE:**
**Shah Bano Begum v. Mohd. Ahmed Khan (AIR 1985 SC 945):**
Though about Muslim law, established divorced wife can claim under Section 125 if not adequately provided for.

**CONCLUSION:**
Section 125 CrPC offers significant advantages of speed, accessibility, and stronger enforcement through criminal machinery, making it valuable remedy for wives needing immediate financial support without waiting for lengthy District Court proceedings. Strategic use of both Section 125 and HMA provisions provides comprehensive financial protection.

## ❓ QUESTION 5

**Q5-DIV-5M:** Explain irretrievable breakdown of marriage as ground for divorce.

### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

**INTRODUCTION:**
Irretrievable breakdown of marriage refers to situation where marriage has broken down beyond repair with no possibility of reconciliation. Though not explicitly mentioned as ground in Hindu Marriage Act, it has been judicially recognized.

**CONCEPT:**
Marriage relationship has deteriorated to such extent that:
- No possibility of parties living together
- No chance of reconciliation
- Continuation would be mere legal formality
- Emotional and mental bond completely destroyed

**NOT EXPLICIT GROUND:**
Section 13 of Hindu Marriage Act does not list irretrievable breakdown as explicit ground for divorce (unlike some foreign jurisdictions).

**JUDICIAL RECOGNITION:**

**Two Methods:**

**Method 1: Under Cruelty [Section 13(1)(ia)]**

Courts hold that:
- Forcing spouse to continue dead marriage is itself cruelty
- Irretrievable breakdown can constitute mental cruelty
- Continued separation evidence of breakdown

**Method 2: Under Article 142 of Constitution**

Supreme Court can grant divorce using constitutional powers when:
- Marriage irretrievably broken
- No purpose in keeping parties tied
- Justice and equity require dissolution

**LANDMARK CASES:**

**1. Naveen Kohli v. Neelu Kohli (2006) 4 SCC 558:**
- Supreme Court recognized irretrievable breakdown
- Long separation with no reconciliation possibility
- Court can grant divorce under Article 142
- Forcing continuation of dead marriage is cruelty to both

**2. Samar Ghosh v. Jaya Ghosh (2007) 4 SCC 511:**
- Irretrievable breakdown can constitute mental cruelty
- Listed as form of cruelty

**3. Vishwanathan v. Rukn-ul-mulk Rukmani Devi (2008):**
- Article 142 used to grant divorce despite absence of traditional ground
- Marriage dead beyond repair

**FACTORS INDICATING BREAKDOWN:**

1. Long period of separation (5+ years)
2. Multiple failed reconciliation attempts
3. Pending litigation for extended period
4. Mutual hostility and bitterness
5. Separate lives established
6. No communication or relationship
7. Living with other partners
8. Both wish to end marriage but caught in legal technicalities

**LAW COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS:**

**Law Commission Report No. 217 (2009):**
- Recommended irretrievable breakdown as explicit ground
- Suggested amendment to Section 13
- Parliament yet to act

**CRITICISM AND DEBATE:**

**Arguments For:**
- Realistic approach
- No purpose in continuing dead marriage
- Prevents legal entrapment
- Modern no-fault approach

**Arguments Against:**
- May be misused
- Protect weaker party (usually wife)
- Financial settlement concerns
- One party may not agree

**CURRENT POSITION:**

While not statutory ground:
- Courts recognize through cruelty
- Article 142 used in appropriate cases
- Case-by-case basis
- Discretionary

**CONCLUSION:**
Though not explicit ground under Section 13, irretrievable breakdown has gained judicial recognition as form of mental cruelty or basis for Article 142 intervention. This reflects modern understanding that forcing parties to remain in dead marriage serves neither individual nor social interest, though legislative amendment would provide greater clarity and certainty.

## ❓ QUESTION 2

**Q2-RCR-5M:** What is restitution of conjugal rights? Is it constitutionally valid?

### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

**INTRODUCTION:**
Restitution of conjugal rights under Section 9 of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 is a matrimonial remedy aimed at reconciliation when one spouse withdraws from society of other without reasonable excuse.

**SECTION 9 PROVISION:**
When either spouse has withdrawn from society of other without reasonable excuse, aggrieved party can apply to District Court for restitution of conjugal rights.

**CONCEPT:**
"Conjugal rights" include:

**CONDITIONS:**
1. Withdrawal from society of other spouse
2. Without reasonable excuse
3. No legal ground to refuse

**EFFECT OF DECREE:**

**CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDITY:**

**Challenge 1: T. Sareetha (AP HC 1983):**
- Struck down Section 9
- Held: Violates Articles 14, 21 (privacy, dignity)

**Challenge 2: Harvinder Kaur (Del HC 1984):**
- Upheld Section 9
- Purpose: Reconciliation
- Not forcible execution

**SUPREME COURT: Saroj Rani (1984):**
- **UPHELD constitutional validity**
- Does NOT violate Articles 14, 21
- Purpose is reconciliation, not forced cohabitation
- Cannot be executed by physical force
- Reasonable restriction in interest of marriage institution
- Promotes cooling period and reflection

**CURRENT LAW:**
Section 9 is **constitutionally valid** and operative throughout India.

**CRITICISM:**
- Rarely leads to genuine reconciliation
- Often stepping stone to divorce
- 1-year wait prolongs inevitable
- Privacy concerns remain

**CONCLUSION:**
Despite constitutional challenges, Section 9 remains valid law as held by Supreme Court in Saroj Rani case, serving as reconciliation mechanism with divorce option available after 1-year non-compliance.

## ❓ QUESTION 4

**Q4-DIV-5M:** Write a note on grounds available exclusively to wife under Section 13(2).

### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

**INTRODUCTION:**
Section 13(2) of Hindu Marriage Act provides four additional grounds for divorce available exclusively to wife, recognizing historical disadvantages and specific vulnerabilities women face.

**THE FOUR SPECIAL GROUNDS:**

**Mnemonic: "BRMR"**

---

### **GROUND 1: HUSBAND'S PRE-ACT BIGAMY [13(2)(i)]**

**Provision:**
Applicable to marriages solemnized before 1955 where husband had another wife married before such commencement and that wife was alive at time of petitioner's marriage.

**Explanation:**
- Deals with pre-1955 polygamous marriages
- Protects women who were second/third wives
- Provides exit from polygamous relationship

**Limited Application:**
Applies only to pre-1955 marriages.

---

### **GROUND 2: RAPE, SODOMY, BESTIALITY [13(2)(ii)]**

**Provision:**
"that the husband has, since the solemnization of the marriage, been guilty of rape, sodomy or bestiality"

**Explanation:**
If husband guilty of:
- **Rape** (of any person, including wife)
- **Sodomy** (unnatural sexual offenses)
- **Bestiality** (sexual intercourse with animal)

**Rationale:**
- Serious moral turpitude
- Criminal offenses
- Incompatible with marital relationship
- Justifies divorce for wife

**Note:** These are criminal offenses under IPC also.

---

### **GROUND 3: MAINTENANCE NON-COMPLIANCE [13(2)(iii)]**

**Provision:**
Decree or order for maintenance under Section 125 CrPC passed against husband and he failed to comply for **1 year or more**.

**Requirements:**
- Valid maintenance order exists
- Under Section 125 CrPC
- Husband failed to pay for 1 year+

**Rationale:**
- Non-maintenance amounts to cruelty
- Shows disregard for wife's welfare
- Economic abandonment

---

### **GROUND 4: REPUDIATION OF CHILD MARRIAGE [13(2)(iv)]**

**Provision:**
Marriage solemnized before wife attained age 15, and she repudiated marriage after attaining 15 but before 18.

**Limited Application:**
With current minimum age 18, this ground has very limited scope.

**Historical Significance:**
Protected child brides who wished to exit forced marriages.

---

**RATIONALE FOR WIFE-ONLY GROUNDS:**

**1. Historical Disadvantage:**
- Women traditionally powerless
- Additional protection needed

**2. Economic Dependence:**
- Maintenance critical for survival
- Non-compliance serious issue

**3. Sexual Exploitation:**
- Rape, unnatural acts protection
- Bodily integrity rights

**4. Pre-Act Polygamy:**
- Women trapped in polygamous marriages
- Needed exit route

**EQUALITY DEBATE:**

**Criticism:**
Some argue provisions should be gender-neutral in modern times.

**Justification:**
- Women still economically weaker (statistically)
- Ground-specific situations (pre-Act polygamy, rape by husband)
- Affirmative action justified

**TOTAL GROUNDS FOR WIFE:**
- 9 common [13(1)]
- 2 additional [13(1A)]
- 4 special [13(2)]
- **Total: 15 grounds**

**CONCLUSION:**
Section 13(2) special grounds for wife recognize gender-specific vulnerabilities and historical disadvantages, providing additional protection through grounds addressing polygamy, sexual exploitation, and economic abandonment. While gender equality advances, these provisions remain justified given continuing socio-economic realities and nature-specific circumstances they address.
