### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Maintenance and alimony are essential financial support mechanisms ensuring that economically vulnerable spouses (typically wives) are not left destitute during or after matrimonial breakdown. The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 provides two types of maintenance: Section 24 (maintenance pendente lite during proceedings) and Section 25 (permanent alimony after decree). Additionally, Section 125 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 provides a parallel criminal remedy for maintenance. These provisions recognize economic vulnerabilities, prevent destitution, and ensure access to justice and post-divorce financial security.

**Provided** that the application... shall, as far as possible, be disposed of within sixty days from the date of service of notice..."

Yes, but:

Lawyers often advise:

2. File HMA divorce petition

4. Section 24 maintenance in HMA proceedings
5. After divorce, Section 25 permanent alimony

- Stay Section 125 proceedings, OR

Not charity but legal right ensuring basic sustenance.

**2. Recognize Contributions:**
Acknowledge homemaking, child-rearing, career sacrifice.

Maintain reasonable standard of living.

**4. Not Punishment:**
Alimony not to punish payer; balance required.

**5. Changed Circumstances:**
Flexible - can modify based on changes.

---

#### **CONCLUSION**

Maintenance provisions under Hindu Marriage Act (Sections 24 and 25) and Section 125 CrPC provide comprehensive financial protection framework for economically vulnerable spouses. Section 24 ensures interim support enabling litigation access; Section 25 provides post-decree financial security; and Section 125 offers speedy criminal remedy without requiring divorce proceedings.

The three provisions complement each other: Section 24 for interim relief during HMA proceedings, Section 25 for permanent post-decree alimony, and Section 125 for quick relief without HMA proceedings. The RICO factors ensure court considers all relevant circumstances in determining fair quantum.

Despite being gender-neutral provisions, they predominantly protect wives, reflecting continuing socio-economic reality of women's economic dependence. The removal of upper limit in Section 125 (2001 Amendment) and judicial emphasis on dignified living standards (Shamima Farooqui) demonstrate evolution toward more realistic and adequate maintenance levels.

Strategic use of all three provisions, with Section 125 providing immediate relief while HMA proceedings continue, offers effective protection mechanism. As economic roles evolve and more women become financially independent, maintenance law continues to adapt, though the core principle remains: preventing destitution and ensuring financial security during and after matrimonial breakdown.
