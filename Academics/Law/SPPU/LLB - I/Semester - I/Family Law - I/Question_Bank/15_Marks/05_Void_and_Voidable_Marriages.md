### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

#### **INTRODUCTION**

The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 makes a fundamental and crucial distinction between void marriages (Section 11) and voidable marriages (Section 12). This distinction determines the legal status of the marriage, rights of parties, legitimacy of children, and remedies available. A void marriage has no legal existence from the beginning (null ab initio), while a voidable marriage remains valid until annulled by a competent court. Understanding this distinction is essential for proper application of matrimonial law and protection of parties' rights.

### **PART I: VOID MARRIAGES [Section 11]**

#### **A. DEFINITION AND NATURE**

**Section 11 states:**
"Any marriage solemnized after the commencement of this Act shall be null and void and may, on a petition presented by either party thereto against the other party, be so declared by a decree of nullity if it contravenes any one of the conditions specified in clauses (i), (iv) and (v) of section 5."

**Nature:**
- Marriage is **null and void ab initio** (from the very beginning)
- Has no legal existence in eyes of law
- Creates no rights or obligations between parties
- Decree of nullity is merely **declaratory** (declares existing fact)
- No formal decree necessary for marriage to be void (though advisable for practical purposes)

#### **B. GROUNDS FOR VOID MARRIAGE (3 Grounds)**

1. **Li**ving spouse (Bigamy)

---

#### **CONCLUSION**

The distinction between void and voidable marriages under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 is fundamental to matrimonial jurisprudence. Void marriages (bigamy, sapinda, prohibited relationships) involve serious violations of public policy and social norms, rendering them null from inception. Voidable marriages (impotence, mental incapacity, underage, force/fraud, pregnancy by another) involve personal capacity or consent issues, allowing the affected party to decide whether to continue or terminate the marriage.

The classification serves important purposes: it protects societal interests through absolute prohibition of bigamous and incestuous marriages while respecting individual autonomy in matters of personal capacity. The legitimacy granted to children under Section 16, regardless of whether the marriage is void or voidable, reflects the humanitarian approach of the legislation.

Understanding this distinction is crucial for legal practitioners, judges, and parties themselves, as it determines available remedies, time limitations, rights of parties, and status of children. The void/voidable dichotomy represents a sophisticated legal framework that balances public policy concerns with individual rights and provides appropriate remedies for different types of matrimonial irregularities.
