### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

#### **INTRODUCTION**

The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 introduced the concept of divorce in Hindu Law, marking a revolutionary departure from classical Hindu Law which considered marriage an indissoluble sacrament. Section 13 of the Act provides various grounds on which either spouse, or in some cases only the wife, can seek dissolution of marriage by decree of divorce. The 1976 Amendment significantly liberalized these grounds and introduced mutual consent divorce. Currently, there are **15 grounds** for divorce: 9 common to both spouses, 2 additional grounds, and 4 special grounds available only to wife.

### **SECTION 13(1): COMMON GROUNDS (Available to Both Spouses)**

#### **9 GROUNDS - Mnemonic: "AC-DCI-LVR-P"**

---

### **GROUND 1: ADULTERY [Section 13(1)(i)]**

**Provision:**
"has, after the solemnization of the marriage, had voluntary sexual intercourse with any person other than his or her spouse"

**Essential Elements:**
1. Sexual intercourse (actual intercourse necessary)
2. Voluntary (not by force/rape)
3. After marriage
4. With person other than spouse

**Single Act Sufficient:**
Even one act of adultery constitutes ground for divorce.

**Proof:**
- Direct evidence rarely available
- Can be proved by circumstantial evidence
- Opportunity + Inclination = Inference

**Case Law:**
**Smt. Jorden Diengdeh v. S.S. Chopra (AIR 1985 SC 935):**
- Adultery can be inferred from circumstances
- Direct proof not always necessary
- Strong evidence of opportunity and disposition sufficient

**Illustration:**
Wife discovers husband having sexual relations with another woman. Sufficient ground for divorce even if it occurred only once.

---

### **GROUND 2: CRUELTY [Section 13(1)(ia)]**

**Provision:**
"has treated the petitioner with cruelty"

**Types:**

**A. Physical Cruelty:**
- Physical violence, assault
- Causing bodily harm
- Threatening violence

**B. Mental Cruelty:**
- Conduct causing mental pain and suffering
- Reasonable apprehension of harm
- Making life miserable

**Test for Cruelty:**
Would conduct cause reasonable apprehension of harm (physical/mental) to petitioner?
- **Subjective:** Effect on particular spouse
- **Objective:** Would reasonable person consider it cruel?

**Landmark Case:**
**Samar Ghosh v. Jaya Ghosh (2007) 4 SCC 511:**

Supreme Court provided illustrative (not exhaustive) list of mental cruelty:
1. Repeated rude and discourteous behavior
2. Constant demands for money/property
3. Persistent false accusations
4. Denial of sexual relations
5. Persistent malicious behavior
6. Unfounded criticism
7. Public humiliation and insult
8. Desertion without cause
9. Persistent denial of access to children
10. Unreasonable jealousy
11. False allegations of adultery/cruelty
12. Habitual drunkenness/drug addiction
13. Unwillingness to have children without valid reason
14. Persistent nagging
15. Refusal to cohabit
16. Forcing spouse to live separately from family
17. Many other acts causing mental agony

**Other Important Cases:**

**Dastane v. Dastane (AIR 1975 SC 1534):**
- Cruelty is conduct causing reasonable apprehension of harm
- Not limited to physical violence

**Naveen Kohli v. Neelu Kohli (2006) 4 SCC 558:**
- Irretrievable breakdown of marriage can amount to cruelty
- Forcing spouse to continue dead marriage is itself cruelty

**Illustration:**
Wife constantly nags husband, makes false allegations of adultery, refuses to cook, publicly humiliates him. This constitutes mental cruelty justifying divorce.

---

### **GROUND 3: DESERTION [Section 13(1)(ib)]**

**Provision:**

#### **CONCLUSION**

Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 provides a comprehensive framework of 15 grounds for divorce, reflecting both fault-based and no-fault approaches. The grounds cover matrimonial offenses (adultery, cruelty, desertion), incapacity (insanity, disease), and abandonment (renunciation, presumed death). The special grounds for wife recognize historical disadvantages faced by women.

The 1976 Amendment was a watershed moment, introducing mutual consent divorce and equalizing grounds, making Hindu divorce law more progressive and gender-just. Judicial interpretation, particularly in cases like Samar Ghosh (mental cruelty) and Naveen Kohli (irretrievable breakdown), has further evolved the law to meet contemporary needs.

These provisions strike a balance between preserving marriage as an institution and providing exit from irretrievably broken relationships, ensuring that parties are not forced to continue in marriages marked by cruelty, desertion, or other serious matrimonial wrongs.

## ❓ QUESTION 2

**Q2-DIV-15M:** Explain "cruelty" as a ground for divorce under Hindu Marriage Act. What constitutes mental cruelty? Discuss with leading case laws.

### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Cruelty as a ground for divorce under Section 13(1)(ia) of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 has become the most frequently invoked ground in contemporary matrimonial litigation. While physical cruelty is relatively straightforward to establish, the concept of mental cruelty has undergone significant judicial development.

- Public shaming on social media
- Sharing private information
As forms of mental cruelty.

---

#### **CONCLUSION**

Cruelty as a ground for divorce under Section 13(1)(ia) has evolved from a narrow concept focused on physical violence to a broad, inclusive ground encompassing physical, mental, and emotional harm. The judicial expansion of mental cruelty through landmark cases like Dastane, V. Bhagat, Naveen Kohli, and especially Samar Ghosh has made divorce accessible to spouses suffering psychological and emotional abuse.

The subjective-objective test ensures that while individual sensitivity is considered, frivolous claims are filtered out. The recognition that irretrievable breakdown of marriage itself can constitute cruelty reflects modern understanding that forcing parties to continue in a dead marriage is itself a form of torture.

Cruelty provisions serve as a safety valve, allowing escape from marriages marked by violence, abuse, or persistent mistreatment. They recognize that marriage should be based on mutual respect, care, and affection, and when these elements are replaced by cruelty, divorce becomes a necessary remedy to protect the aggrieved spouse's dignity, health, and wellbeing.

As society evolves, judicial interpretation of cruelty continues to expand, addressing new forms of abuse including cyber harassment and economic exploitation, ensuring that matrimonial law remains relevant and responsive to contemporary challenges.
