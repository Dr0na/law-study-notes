### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Schools of Hindu Law represent different systems of interpretation and application of Hindu legal principles. The two major schools—Mitakshara and Dayabhaga—emerged from scholarly commentaries on ancient Smritis and created distinct regional variations that persist even today. The fundamental difference between these schools lies in their treatment of coparcenary, succession, and the concept of birthright in ancestral property. While the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 unified succession rules across India, the distinction between these schools remains relevant for matters concerning coparcenary property and joint family.

### **PART I: MITAKSHARA SCHOOL**

#### **A. BASIC INFORMATION**

**Name Origin:** "Mitakshara" means "measured in words" or "brief commentary"

**Author:** Vijnaneshwara (11th Century CE), court scholar of Chalukya King Vikramaditya VI

**Text Basis:** Commentary on Yajnavalkya Smriti

**Geographical Application:**
- Covers majority of India
- **Excludes:** Bengal and Assam (where Dayabhaga applies)
- States: UP, Bihar (except Mithila followers), Maharashtra, Gujarat, MP, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan, etc.

**Sub-Schools:**
Mitakshara has **FIVE** major sub-schools:

**Mnemonic: "BMBD-P"**
1. **Benaras** (UP, North India) - Orthodox, followed Mitakshara text closely
2. **Mithila** (Bihar) - Vivada Ratnakara by Chandeswara
3. **Bombay** (Maharashtra, Gujarat) - Vyavahara Mayukha by Nilakantha
4. **Dravida/Madras** (Tamil Nadu, South) - Smriti Chandrika; most liberal
5. **Punjab** (Punjab, Haryana) - Customary law influenced

---

#### **B. KEY PRINCIPLES OF MITAKSHARA**

### **1. COPARCENARY CONCEPT**

**Definition:**
Coparcenary is a narrower body than joint family consisting of male lineal descendants within **four degrees** from common ancestor.

**Classical Position:**
Only **males** were coparceners:
- Son, grandson, great-grandson, great-great-grandson from common male ancestor

**2005 Amendment:**
Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 made **daughters coparceners** equal to sons from birth.

**Illustration:**
```
A (Propositus)
↓
B (Son) - Degree 1
↓
C (Grandson) - Degree 2
↓
D (Great-grandson) - Degree 3
↓
E (Great-great-grandson) - Degree 4
↓
F (Son of E) - Exceeds 4 degrees, NOT coparcener with A
```

A, B, C, D, E form coparcenary. When E's son F is born, F cannot be coparcener with A (exceeds 4 degrees).

---

### **2. BIRTH RIGHT PRINCIPLE**

**Doctrine:**
Under Mitakshara, a son acquires an **interest by birth** in ancestral (coparcenary) property.

**Significance:**
- No act of father required to confer right
- Son becomes coparcener immediately upon birth
- Right accrues automatically

**Father's Limited Power:**
- Father cannot alienate coparcenary property without son's consent
- Exception: Legal necessity or benefit of estate
- Sons can challenge alienation

**2005 Amendment Impact:**
Daughters now also acquire interest by birth as coparceners.

**Case Law:**
**Suraj Narain v. Iqbal Narain (AIR 1953 All 221):**
Son's birthright in coparcenary property cannot be defeated by father's unauthorized alienation.

**Illustration:**
When son B is born to A, B immediately acquires interest in coparcenary property that A inherited from A's father. A cannot sell this property without B's consent (unless legal necessity).

---

### **3. SURVIVORSHIP DOCTRINE**

**Principle:**
On death of a coparcener, his share does not pass by succession but by **survivorship** to surviving coparceners.

**Rule:**
Interest of deceased coparcener expands and merges with shares of surviving coparceners automatically.

**Exception:**
If deceased coparcener leaves Class I heirs under Hindu Succession Act, 1956:
- Widow, mother, daughter, son, etc.
- They inherit (not by survivorship but as Class I heirs)

**Illustration:**
A and his three sons B, C, D are coparceners (each holding 1/4). D dies without leaving Class I heirs. D's 1/4 share merges with shares of A, B, C by survivorship (each now holds 1/3).

---

### **4. JOINT FAMILY PROPERTY CLASSIFICATION**

**Two Types:**

**A. Ancestral/Coparcenary Property:**
- Property inherited from father, grandfather, or great-grandfather
- All coparceners have birthright
- Cannot be alienated by karta without necessity/benefit

**B. Self-Acquired/Separate Property:**
- Property acquired by individual's own efforts
- Property received through will, gift, or partition
- Full ownership; can alienate freely

**Illustration:**
Property A inherited from his grandfather = Ancestral property for A's sons. Property A purchased from his salary = A's self-acquired property.

---

### **5. PARTITION RIGHT**

**Principle:**
Any coparcener can demand partition as matter of right.

**Types:**
- Partial partition (some members separate)
- Total partition (complete disruption)

**Effect:**
- Coparcenary status ends
- Property divided per capita (by headcount)
- Each gets definite share

---

### **PART II: DAYABHAGA SCHOOL**

#### **A. BASIC INFORMATION**

**Name Origin:** "Dayabhaga" means "Division of Inheritance"

**Author:** Jimutavahana (12th Century CE), Bengal scholar

**Text Basis:** Original treatise (not a commentary on another work)

**Geographical Application:**
- Bengal (West Bengal)
- Assam
- Parts of Odisha

**No Sub-Schools:**
Unlike Mitakshara, Dayabhaga has no regional sub-schools.

**Fundamental Difference:**
Dayabhaga **rejects** Mitakshara's doctrine of birthright and survivorship.

---

#### **B. KEY PRINCIPLES OF DAYABHAGA**

### **1. NO BIRTH RIGHT**

**Doctrine:**
Sons do **NOT** acquire any interest in father's property during father's lifetime merely by birth.

**Significance:**
- Father has absolute ownership
- Father can alienate property freely without son's consent
- Sons inherit only after father's death
- Sons have only "spes successionis" (hope of succession)

**Contrast with Mitakshara:**
- **Mitakshara:** Son has present interest by birth
- **Dayabhaga:** Son has only expectancy/hope to inherit

**Illustration:**
Under Dayabhaga, if father sells all property during lifetime, sons have no legal remedy as they had no present interest in property.

---

### **2. SUCCESSION, NOT SURVIVORSHIP**

**Principle:**
Property passes by **succession** (inheritance) upon death, not by survivorship.

**Significance:**
- Deceased's share distributed among his heirs according to succession rules
- Surviving coparceners don't automatically take deceased's share
- Regular inheritance law applies

**Contrast:**
- **Mitakshara:** Share passes to surviving coparceners by survivorship
- **Dayabhaga:** Share passes to heirs by succession (may include wife, daughter)

**Illustration:**
Under Dayabhaga: A, B (son), C (son) form joint family. B dies leaving widow W and daughter D. B's share passes to W and D by succession (not to A and C by survivorship).

---

### **3. SAPINDA RELATIONSHIP**

**Definition:**
Connected by offerings of pinda (rice balls) in funeral ceremonies.

**Extent:**
- Through father: Up to **7 degrees**
- Through mother: Up to **5 degrees**

**Significance:**
Sapinda relationship determines:
- Who can inherit
- Marriage prohibitions (though HMA now uses 3/5 degrees)

**Note:** Dayabhaga's sapinda is different from HMA's sapinda which uses 3/5 degrees.

---

### **4. SAPINDA ORDER OF SUCCESSION**

Dayabhaga has distinct order:
1. Sapindas (blood relations)
2. Sakulyas (cognates beyond sapinda)
3. Spiritual teacher
4. Disciple
5. King (State)

**Modern Position:**
Hindu Succession Act, 1956 superseded this order with statutory Class I, Class II, Agnates, Cognates.

---

### **5. WIDOW'S BETTER POSITION**

**Under Dayabhaga:**
- Widow inherits as heir
- Gets share equal to son
- Better position than classical Mitakshara

**Historical Restriction:**
- Limited ownership (couldn't freely alienate)
- Property reverted after her death

**Modern Law:**
Hindu Succession Act, 1956 gives widow absolute rights as Class I heir.

### **PART III: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS**

#### **DETAILED COMPARISON TABLE:**

| **Aspect** | **MITAKSHARA** | **DAYABHAGA** |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Author** | Vijnaneshwara | Jimutavahana |
| **Century** | 11th | 12th |
| **Text Type** | Commentary | Original Treatise |
| **Area** | Most of India | Bengal, Assam |
| **Birth Right** | ✓ YES - Son has present interest | ✗ NO - Only expectancy |
| **Father's Power** | Limited - Cannot alienate coparcenary property | Absolute - Can alienate freely |
| **On Death** | Survivorship (to coparceners) | Succession (to heirs) |
| **Coparcenary** | Recognized; 4-degree rule | Not in same sense |
| **Partition** | Coparcener can demand | Different rules |
| **Widow's Rights** | Limited historically | Better - equal to son |
| **Sub-schools** | 5 (BMBD-P) | None |
| **Sapinda Degrees** | Not specifically defined | 7 (father), 5 (mother) |

### **FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE EXPLAINED**

**EXAMPLE SCENARIO:**

**Facts:** A (father) has ancestral property worth ₹10 lakhs. B is A's son. A wants to sell property.

**Under Mitakshara:**
- B has birthright in property (present interest)
- A cannot sell without B's consent (unless legal necessity)
- If A sells, B can challenge sale
- B can demand partition

**Under Dayabhaga:**
- B has no present interest (only hope to inherit)
- A has absolute ownership
- A can sell freely without B's consent
- B cannot challenge sale during A's lifetime
- B inherits only if property exists at A's death

**This Example Illustrates:**
Core philosophical difference - present right vs future expectancy.

### **PART IV: MODERN RELEVANCE**

#### **IMPACT OF HINDU SUCCESSION ACT, 1956**

**Unification:**
- HSA 1956 unified succession rules across India
- Both schools now follow same statutory rules for intestate succession
- Class I, Class II heirs same for all

**Surviving Distinctions:**
Despite codification, schools differ in:
- Coparcenary property concepts
- Joint family property matters
- Partition procedures
- Birthright in ancestral property

---

#### **2005 AMENDMENT IMPACT**

**Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005:**
- Made daughters coparceners in Mitakshara coparcenary
- Equal to sons from birth
- Rights by birth, survivorship, partition

**Case Law:**
**Vineeta Sharma v. Rakesh Sharma (2020) 9 SCC 1:**
- Clarified daughter's coparcenary rights apply retrospectively
- Equal rights to ancestral property
- Significant impact on Mitakshara system

**Dayabhaga Impact:**
Less affected as birthright concept didn't exist in Dayabhaga.

---

### **PART V: PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE TODAY**

**Where Schools Still Matter:**

**1. Coparcenary Property:**
- Mitakshara coparcenary concepts still relevant
- Birthright principles apply
- Partition rights

**2. Joint Family Property:**
- Distinction between ancestral and self-acquired
- Relevant in Mitakshara areas

**3. Customary Practices:**
- Regional customs influenced by schools
- Marriage ceremonies
- Family practices

**4. Judicial Interpretation:**
- Courts refer to school principles
- Interpret ambiguous provisions
- Fill gaps in statute

**Where Schools Don't Matter:**

**1. Intestate Succession:**
- HSA 1956 applies uniformly
- Class I and II heirs same

**2. Wills:**
- Testamentary succession uniform

**3. Marriage Law:**
- HMA 1955 applies uniformly to all Hindus

---

#### **CONCLUSION**

The Mitakshara and Dayabhaga schools, emerging from 11th and 12th century commentaries, represent two fundamentally different approaches to Hindu Law, particularly regarding property rights. Mitakshara's birthright and survivorship concepts contrast sharply with Dayabhaga's rejection of birthright and adoption of succession principles. While the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 unified succession law and the 2005 Amendment extended coparcenary rights to daughters, the schools remain relevant for understanding coparcenary property, joint family matters, and regional customary practices.

The distinction demonstrates that Hindu Law is not monolithic but evolved differently across regions based on different interpretations of ancient texts. Mitakshara's influence is dominant, covering most of India, while Dayabhaga's principles govern Bengal and Assam. Understanding both schools is essential for comprehensive knowledge of Hindu Law's historical development and continuing regional variations.

The 2005 Amendment's impact on Mitakshara coparcenary by including daughters as coparceners represents the most significant modern reform, bringing gender equality to property rights while maintaining the basic structure of coparcenary. As Hindu Law continues to evolve through legislation and judicial interpretation, these schools provide essential context for understanding contemporary provisions and their application.
