> **Status Frustration** = Frustration experienced by lower-class boys when they fail to achieve status in middle-class institutions, particularly schools.

**Developed by:** Albert Cohen (1955)

## **THE MIDDLE-CLASS MEASURING ROD**

### Concept
- Schools judge all students by middle-class standards
- "Middle-class measuring rod" applied to everyone
- Lower-class boys evaluated by standards they weren't prepared for

### Middle-Class Values in Schools (6)
- Ambition and future planning
- Academic achievement
- Self-reliance
- Respect for property
- Verbal skills and articulation
- Non-violence and self-control

---

## **LOWER-CLASS REALITY**
- Live in present, not future
- Survival focus, not achievement
- Collective orientation
- Lack possessions
- Limited vocabulary
- Physical toughness valued

---

## **THE PROBLEM**

### Process of Status Frustration:
```
Lower-Class Boys → Middle-Class School → Judged by Middle-Class Standards → CANNOT MEET STANDARDS → Failure + Humiliation → STATUS FRUSTRATION
```

### Consequences
- Poor grades and academic failure
- Teacher disapproval
- Peer rejection by middle-class students
- Feel inadequate and humiliated
- Shared frustration among lower-class boys

---

## **THE SOLUTION: DELINQUENT SUBCULTURE**

### Reaction Formation
- Boys come together sharing same problem
- INVERT middle-class values completely
- Create opposite value system
- New status system where delinquency brings respect

### New Status Hierarchy
- Status gained through:
  - Toughness and fighting
  - Daring criminal acts
  - Defying authority
  - Loyalty to gang

---

## **CONCLUSION**

Status frustration explains why lower-class boys form delinquent gangs with inverted values. Systematic failure in middle-class institutions leads to reaction formation where rejected values are inverted, creating subculture where delinquency, not achievement, brings status and respect. Understanding status frustration is key to Cohen's theory of gang delinquency.
