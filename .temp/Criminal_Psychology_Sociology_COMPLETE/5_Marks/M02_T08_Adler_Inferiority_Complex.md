Adler's theory posits that inferiority complex, arising from physical defects, social rejection, or low status, leads to criminal behavior as compensation mechanism. Crime becomes way to prove superiority, gain recognition, and overcome feelings of inadequacy. While not explaining all crime, theory provides psychological insight into how perceived inferiority can drive criminal behavior as maladaptive coping strategy for low self-worth and social rejection.
