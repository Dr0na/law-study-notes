## **FREUD'S THREE-PART PERSONALITY STRUCTURE**

---

### **1. THE ID**

**Nature:**
- Primitive part of personality
- Present at birth
- Completely unconscious

**Represents:**
- Unconscious biological drives
- Basic needs: food, water, sex, sleep
- Seeks immediate gratification

**Operating Principle:**
- **Pleasure Principle**
- "I want it NOW!"
- Immediate satisfaction demanded

---

### **2. THE EGO**

**Nature:**
- Develops after Id
- Conscious and unconscious
- Mediator between Id and reality

**Function:**
- Compensates for Id's demands
- Guides actions realistically
- Remains within social boundaries
- Considers what is practical and acceptable

**Operating Principle:**
- **Reality Principle**
- "Let's be practical about this"
- Adapts Id's desires to reality

---

### **3. THE SUPEREGO**

**Nature:**
- Force of self-criticism and conscience
- Moral component of personality
- Develops through socialization

**Development:**
- Internalizes moral standards from parents and society
- Incorporates values and ethics
- Learns right from wrong

**Function:**
- Controls Id's selfish impulses
- Guides Ego toward moral behavior
- Creates guilt when moral code violated

**Operating Principle:**
- **Morality Principle**
- "That's wrong!"
- Conscience and moral judgment

---

## **IMBALANCE AND CRIME**

### How Imbalance Leads to Crime:

**Overdeveloped Id:**
- Strong primitive urges
- Weak Ego and Superego
- **Result:** Impulsive violent crimes

**Underdeveloped Superego:**
- No conscience or guilt
- **Result:** Psychopathic behavior

**Overdeveloped Superego:**
- Excessive guilt
- Needs punishment
- **Result:** Crime as self-punishment

---

## **CONCLUSION**

Freud's Id-Ego-Superego model explains personality structure. Crime results from imbalance among three components. Properly balanced personality with strong Ego mediating Id's desires according to Superego's moral guidance produces law-abiding behavior. Imbalance in any direction can lead to criminal behavior through different mechanisms.
