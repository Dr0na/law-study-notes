## **PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS AFFECTING EYEWITNESS ACCURACY**

---

### **1. ENCODING (During Event)**

**Stress and Arousal:**
- High stress impairs memory formation
- Weapon focus effect (attention on weapon, not face)
- Tunnel vision under extreme stress

**Duration of Exposure:**
- Brief exposure → Poor memory
- Longer exposure → Better memory
- Time matters significantly

**Witness Characteristics:**
- Age (children, elderly less accurate)
- Intelligence level
- Expectations and biases

---

### **2. STORAGE (Retention Period)**

**Time Delay:**
- Memory fades over time naturally
- Details lost, only gist remains
- Forgetting curve applies

**Post-Event Information:**
- New information contaminates original memory
- Suggestions from others alter memory
- Media coverage influences recall
- Memory is reconstructive, not reproductive

---

### **3. RETRIEVAL (During Testimony)**

**Leading Questions:**
- Can distort memory significantly
- Create false memories
- Suggestive questioning problematic

**Lineup Procedures:**
- Biased lineups reduce accuracy
- Sequential vs simultaneous presentation matters
- Double-blind administration prevents bias

---

## **SPECIAL ISSUES**

### Cross-Race Effect
> People better at recognizing faces of own race than other races.

**Why:**
- Lack of experience with other-race faces
- Encode different features
- Higher error rate in cross-race identification

### False Memories (Elizabeth Loftus)
- Memories can be implanted through suggestion
- Leading questions create false memories
- "Lost in the mall" experiment demonstrated this
- Memory is malleable, not fixed recording

---

## **LEGAL IMPLICATION**

> **Eyewitness CONFIDENCE ≠ Accuracy**

- Confident witness may be completely wrong
- Weak correlation between confidence and accuracy
- Courts should not rely solely on eyewitness testimony
- Corroboration essential

---

## **CONCLUSION**

Eyewitness testimony reliability affected by psychological factors at three stages: encoding (stress, duration, witness traits), storage (time delay, post-event information), and retrieval (leading questions, lineup procedures). Cross-race effect and false memory possibilities further complicate accuracy. Understanding these factors crucial for properly evaluating eyewitness evidence. Courts and investigators must recognize limitations and seek corroboration rather than relying solely on eyewitness identification, regardless of witness confidence.
