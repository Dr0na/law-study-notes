## **WALTER MILLER'S THEORY**

> Lower-class culture has distinct values (focal concerns) that naturally produce delinquency when youth conform to them.

**Mnemonic:** T-T-S-E-F-A (or "TT-SEAM")

---

## **SIX FOCAL CONCERNS**

---

### **1. TROUBLE**
- Getting into and out of trouble is major concern
- Trouble brings status but also punishment
- Ambivalent attitude

---

### **2. TOUGHNESS**
- Physical prowess, masculinity highly valued
- Courage, fearlessness, "macho" behavior
- Prove "real man" status

---

### **3. SMARTNESS**
- "Street smarts" - ability to outsmart others
- Cunning, conning, hustling valued
- NOT academic intelligence

---

### **4. EXCITEMENT**
- Seeking thrills, avoiding boredom
- Gambling, drinking, fast driving
- Break monotony of routine life

---

### **5. FATE**
- Belief life controlled by fate/luck
- "What will be, will be"
- External locus of control

---

### **6. AUTONOMY**
- Desire freedom from authority
- Resentment of control
- "Nobody tells me what to do"

---

## **APPLICATION TO DELINQUENCY**

### Miller's Argument
- Boys conforming to lower-class culture
- Expressing focal concerns naturally
- NOT reacting against middle class (differs from Cohen)
- Normal cultural expression defined as delinquent by middle class

---

## **EXAMPLES**

- **Fighting** → Demonstrates toughness
- **Hustling** → Shows smartness
- **Joyriding** → Provides excitement
- **Defying police** → Asserts autonomy

---

## **CONCLUSION**

Miller's six focal concerns—trouble, toughness, smartness, excitement, fate, and autonomy—characterize distinct lower-class culture. When youth conform to these values, behavior often defined as delinquent by middle-class society. Theory argues gang delinquency is cultural expression, not pathological reaction, requiring policy respecting cultural identity while providing legitimate outlets for valued behaviors.
