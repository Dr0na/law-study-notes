## **DEFINITION**

> **Collective Efficacy** = Social cohesion among neighbors combined with willingness to intervene for common good.

**Developed by:** Robert Sampson and Stephen Raudenbush (1990s)

---

### **2. Informal Social Control**
- Willingness to intervene for common good
- Monitor youth and public spaces actively
- Confront troublemakers when needed
- Call police when appropriate
- Maintain neighborhood order collectively
- Take responsibility for community

---

## **HOW IT PREVENTS CRIME**

### Mechanism
- Neighbors watch out for each other
- Youth supervised by community adults
- Suspicious persons questioned
- Deviant behavior confronted immediately
- Collective action prevents disorder

### Key Finding
> **High collective efficacy → Low crime, REGARDLESS of poverty level**

**Implication:**
- Poor neighborhoods with high collective efficacy have LESS crime than expected
- Community organization matters MORE than poverty alone
- Organization overcomes economic disadvantage
- Empowerment and solidarity are protective factors

---

## **CONTRAST WITH SOCIAL DISORGANIZATION**

**Socially Disorganized Area:**
- LOW collective efficacy

- No intervention in others' problems
- "Not my business" attitude
- High crime rates

**Socially Organized Area:**

- Strong social bonds
- Active intervention
- Collective responsibility
- Low crime rates (even if poor)

- Local control over resources

- Community patrols
- Collective problem-solving

## **CONCLUSION**

Collective efficacy—combination of social cohesion and willingness to intervene—explains why some neighborhoods have low crime despite poverty while others with similar economic conditions have high crime. Strong collective efficacy provides informal social control preventing crime through community solidarity and active intervention. Policy should focus on building collective efficacy through strengthening social bonds, empowering residents, and fostering collective action rather than relying solely on formal criminal justice responses. Organized communities can overcome economic disadvantage through social capital and collective action.
