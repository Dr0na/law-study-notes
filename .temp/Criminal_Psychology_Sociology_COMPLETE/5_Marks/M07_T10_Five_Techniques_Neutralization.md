## **DEFINITION**

> **Techniques of Neutralization** = Rationalizations used BEFORE committing crime to overcome guilt and justify behavior temporarily.

**Developed by:** Gresham Sykes and David Matza (1957)

---

## **FIVE TECHNIQUES (3D-CA)**

---

### **1. DENIAL OF RESPONSIBILITY**
- "It wasn't my fault, I had no choice"
- Blame external forces, circumstances
- Examples: "I was drunk," "Friends made me"
- **Effect:** Removes personal blame

---

### **2. DENIAL OF INJURY**
- "Nobody really got hurt"
- Minimize harm done
- Examples: "Store has insurance," "He's rich"
- **Effect:** Reduces seriousness

---

### **3. DENIAL OF VICTIM**
- "They deserved it"
- Victim becomes wrongdoer
- Examples: "He insulted me," "She asked for it"
- **Effect:** Crime becomes justice

---

### **4. CONDEMNATION OF THE CONDEMNERS**
- "Everyone is corrupt, who are they to judge?"
- Attack accusers' credibility
- Examples: "Police take bribes," "Politicians are criminals"
- **Effect:** Deflects blame to others

---

### **5. APPEAL TO HIGHER LOYALTIES**
- "I had to do it for my gang/family"
- Loyalty to smaller group over society
- Examples: "Gang needed me," "Family comes first"
- **Effect:** Crime becomes noble sacrifice

---

## **HOW IT WORKS**

```
Want to commit crime → Feel guilt → Use neutralization → Guilt overcome temporarily → Commit crime
```

**Key Point:** Used BEFORE crime to enable it, not just after as excuse.

---

## **CONCLUSION**

Five techniques—denial of responsibility, denial of injury, denial of victim, condemnation of condemners, and appeal to higher loyalties—allow individuals to temporarily overcome conventional values and commit crimes while maintaining self-image as basically good person. Understanding these techniques enables development of interventions challenging rationalizations and strengthening accountability.
