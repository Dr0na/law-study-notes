## **THEORIES OF AGGRESSION (3)**

**1. Instinct Theory (Freud)**
- Aggression is innate instinct
- Death instinct ("Thanatos")
- Must be expressed outward or inward

**2. Frustration-Aggression (Dollard)**
- Frustration always leads to aggression
- Blocked goals → Frustration → Aggression

**3. Social Learning (Bandura)**
- Aggression is LEARNED through observation and reinforcement
- Not innate, but learned from models
- Bobo Doll experiment proved this

## **CONCLUSION**

Two types of aggression—hostile (impulsive, emotional, goal is harm) and instrumental (planned, unemotional, harm is means to end)—explain different violent crime patterns. Understanding distinction helps in criminal profiling, risk assessment, and treatment planning. Theories range from instinctual to learned, with modern emphasis on social learning showing aggression can be prevented by reducing exposure to violent models and teaching prosocial behaviors.
