## **SUTHERLAND'S NINE PROPOSITIONS**

---

### **Proposition 1:** Criminal Behavior is Learned
- Crime is learned, not inherited
- Not biological or instinctive

---

### **Proposition 2:** Learned through Communication
- Learned in interaction with others
- Through verbal and non-verbal communication

---

### **Proposition 3:** Learning in Intimate Groups
- Principal learning occurs in intimate personal groups
- Family, close friends, gang members most important
- Face-to-face contact crucial

---

### **Proposition 4:** Learning Includes Techniques and Attitudes
- **(a) Techniques** of committing crime (HOW)
- **(b) Motives, rationalizations, attitudes** (WHY)

---

### **Proposition 5:** Learning Definitions
- Learn definitions of legal codes as favorable or unfavorable to violation
- Attitudes toward law learned from associates

---

### **Proposition 6:** THE PRINCIPLE (Core)
- Person becomes delinquent due to **EXCESS of definitions favorable** to violation over unfavorable
- Balance determines behavior
- Heart of the theory

---

### **Proposition 7:** Associations Vary (FPDI)
- **F**requency - how often
- **D**uration - how long
- **P**riority - how early in life
- **I**ntensity - importance of source

---

### **Proposition 8:** All Learning Mechanisms
- Involves all mechanisms in any other learning
- Classical, operant conditioning, modeling

---

### **Proposition 9:** Expresses General Needs
- Criminal behavior expresses general needs (money, status)
- But NOT explained by those needs
- Learning determines METHOD, not the need itself

---

## **CONCLUSION**

Sutherland's nine propositions systematically explain how criminal behavior is learned through differential association with criminal vs non-criminal patterns. The core principle (Proposition 6) that excess of pro-criminal definitions leads to crime remains central to social learning theories of criminal behavior.
