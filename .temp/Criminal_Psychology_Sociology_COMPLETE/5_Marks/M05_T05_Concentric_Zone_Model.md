## **BURGESS'S FIVE CONCENTRIC ZONES**

Park and Burgess studied Chicago and identified 5 zones expanding from city center:

---

### **ZONE I: Central Business District**
- Commercial and industrial area
- Factories, offices, businesses
- Low residential population

---

### **ZONE II: Zone in Transition**
- **HIGHEST CRIME RATE**
- Deteriorating buildings
- Recent immigrants, poorest residents
- High population turnover
- Social disorganization most severe

---

### **ZONE III: Working Men's Homes**
- Working-class neighborhoods
- More stable than Zone II
- Lower crime rate

---

### **ZONE IV: Residential Zone**
- Middle-class homes
- Better living conditions
- Lower crime rates

---

### **ZONE V: Commuter Zone (Suburbs)**
- Affluent suburbs
- **LOWEST CRIME RATES**
- Highest socioeconomic status

---

## **SHAW AND MCKAY'S KEY FINDING**

> Crime rates HIGHEST in **Zone II** and **remained high** even as ethnic groups changed.

### Revolutionary Insight
- NOT the people (ethnicity) causing crime
- But the **AREA CHARACTERISTICS** causing crime
- As Irish moved out, Italians moved in → Crime stayed high
- As Italians moved out, Polish moved in → Crime stayed high
- **Conclusion:** PLACE matters more than PEOPLE

---

## **WHY ZONE II HAS HIGH CRIME**

### Characteristics of Zone II (5)
- Physical deterioration
- High poverty
- Residential instability
- Ethnic heterogeneity
- Weak social control

---

## **CONCLUSION**

Burgess's Concentric Zone Model demonstrates crime is spatially distributed, with highest rates in Zone II (transition zone). Shaw and McKay's finding that crime persists despite ethnic succession proves social disorganization of area, not characteristics of people, drives crime. Model remains influential in understanding urban crime patterns and targeting place-based interventions.
