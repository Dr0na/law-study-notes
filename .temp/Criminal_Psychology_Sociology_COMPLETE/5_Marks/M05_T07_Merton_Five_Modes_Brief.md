## **MERTON'S FIVE MODES OF ADAPTATION**

---

### **1. CONFORMITY** (✅ Goals | ✅ Means)
- Accept cultural goals AND accept institutional means
- Work hard legitimately to achieve success
- Most common adaptation
- **Result:** No crime

---

### **2. INNOVATION** (✅ Goals | ❌ Means)
- Accept goals BUT reject means
- Use illegal means to achieve goals
- **MOST RELEVANT TO CRIME**
- Examples: Theft, fraud, drug dealing
- **Result:** Property crime, white-collar crime

---

### **3. RITUALISM** (❌ Goals | ✅ Means)
- Reject goals BUT accept means
- Lower aspirations, follow rules rigidly
- Example: Low-ambition bureaucrat
- **Result:** Usually not criminal

---

### **4. RETREATISM** (❌ Goals | ❌ Means)
- Reject both goals and means
- Withdraw from society completely
- Examples: Drug addicts, homeless
- **Result:** Drug-related crimes, vagrancy

---

### **5. REBELLION** (🔄 Goals | 🔄 Means)
- Replace existing goals and means with new ones
- Want to change society fundamentally
- Examples: Revolutionaries, terrorists
- **Result:** Political violence

## **CONCLUSION**

Merton's five modes explain different responses to strain between cultural goals and institutional means. Innovation mode (accepting goals but using illegal means) most relevant to explaining crime. Understanding modes helps identify which individuals most at risk for criminal behavior and why.
