## **HOW BONDS PREVENT CRIME**

### Strong Bonds:
- Attachment → Don't hurt loved ones
- Commitment → Too much to lose
- Involvement → No time for crime
- Belief → Crime is wrong
- **Result:** CONFORMITY

### Weak Bonds:
- No attachment → Don't care about others
- No commitment → Nothing to lose
- No involvement → Free time and boredom
- No belief → Law not important
- **Result:** FREE TO COMMIT CRIME

## **CONCLUSION**

Hirschi's four elements of social bond—attachment, commitment, involvement, and belief—explain why people conform to law. When bonds are strong, people are restrained from crime. When bonds are weak or broken, people are free to commit crime. Theory emphasizes strengthening social bonds as crime prevention strategy.
