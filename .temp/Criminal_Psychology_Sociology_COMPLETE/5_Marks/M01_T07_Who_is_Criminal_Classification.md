## **CONCLUSION**

Criminals can be classified by nature of crime, criminal career pattern, or age. Characteristics include both psychological traits (antisocial personality, low self-control) and sociological factors (poor background, criminal associations). Modern classification focuses on risk assessment, treatment needs, and appropriate interventions rather than simplistic typologies. Understanding criminal classifications helps in developing targeted prevention and rehabilitation strategies appropriate to different offender types.
