## **CONCEPT (EDWIN LEMERT)**

Distinction between initial deviance and deviance that becomes part of identity after labeling.

---

## **PRIMARY DEVIANCE**

### Definition
> Initial rule-breaking behavior; minor, experimental, not part of person's identity.

### Characteristics (5)
- First-time or occasional offense
- Experimental or situational
- Not central to self-concept
- Most people commit some primary deviance
- Easily rationalized
- Doesn't lead to criminal identity

### Examples
- Teenager shoplifts once
- Student cheats on exam
- Person lies on taxes once

### Outcome
If not caught/labeled → Person stops, returns to conformity

---

## **SECONDARY DEVIANCE**

### Definition
> Deviant behavior that becomes part of person's identity after being labeled; criminal role becomes master status.

### Process
```
Primary Deviance → LABELED → Internalize label → Identity changes → SECONDARY DEVIANCE (lifestyle)
```

### Characteristics (5)
- Repeated criminal behavior
- Crime central to identity
- Adopt criminal lifestyle
- Join deviant groups
- Hard to stop

### Example
- Youth caught shoplifting
- Labeled "thief," expelled
- Cannot get job
- Joins gang
- Becomes career criminal

## **KEY DIFFERENCE**

| Aspect | Primary | Secondary |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Frequency | Occasional | Repeated |
| Identity | Not part of identity | Central to identity |
| Cause | Various situational | Result of labeling |
| Outcome | Usually stops | Becomes lifestyle |

---

## **CONCLUSION**

Primary deviance is minor initial rule-breaking that doesn't define person, while secondary deviance is persistent criminal behavior resulting from labeling and internalization of criminal identity. Labeling transforms primary into secondary deviance, demonstrating how criminal justice response can paradoxically increase rather than reduce crime. Policy should avoid unnecessary labeling of minor offenders.
