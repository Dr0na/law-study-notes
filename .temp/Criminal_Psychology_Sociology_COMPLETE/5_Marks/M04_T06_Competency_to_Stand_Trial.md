## **DISTINCTION FROM INSANITY DEFENSE**

| Aspect | Competency to Stand Trial | Insanity Defense |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------|
| **Time** | PRESENT mental state | Mental state AT TIME of offense |
| **Issue** | Can participate in trial? | Was responsible for act? |
| **Result** | Trial postponed if incompetent | Not guilty if insane |
| **Treatment** | Restore competency | Psychiatric hospital |

---

## **CONCLUSION**

Competency to stand trial ensures accused can meaningfully participate in own defense by understanding proceedings, communicating with attorney, and making rational decisions. If incompetent, trial postponed while treatment attempts to restore competency. This protects due process rights and ensures fairness in criminal justice system by preventing trial of those unable to defend themselves due to mental incapacity.
