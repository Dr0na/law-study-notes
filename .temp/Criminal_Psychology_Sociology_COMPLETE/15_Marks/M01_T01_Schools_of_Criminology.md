## INTRODUCTION

Schools of Criminology represent evolution of thinking about crime causation and criminal justice response. Each school emerged to address limitations of predecessor.

## SCHOOLS OF CRIMINOLOGY (4)

---

### **1. PRE-CLASSICAL SCHOOL (Before 18th Century)**

**Main Belief:** Crime caused by supernatural forces like demons and evil spirits.

**Trial Methods (3):**
- **Trial by Ordeal:** Test by fire or water - survival meant innocence
- **Trial by Combat:** Physical fight to determine guilt - winner deemed innocent
- **Trial by Oath:** Swear innocence before God with oath-helpers

**Punishment Approach:**
- Cruel and barbaric methods like torture and public executions
- No proportion between crime severity and punishment given
- Aimed at pleasing divine forces and driving out evil

**Key Problem:** No scientific basis, no fairness, innocent often punished.

---

### **2. CLASSICAL SCHOOL (18th Century - 1764)**

**Founded By:** Cesare Beccaria (1738-1794) and Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832)

**Main Belief:** Humans have free will and rationally choose to commit crime.

---

**Core Principles (8):**

**a) Free Will:**
- Every human can choose between right and wrong - criminals make rational decision to break law based on free choice.

**b) Hedonistic Calculus:**
- People weigh pleasure vs pain before crime - if benefits exceed costs, crime occurs through cost-benefit analysis.

**c) Punishment as Deterrent:**
- Punishment must deter both individual and society - must be proportionate, certain, swift, and public to be effective.

**d) Legal Reforms:**
- Abolish torture and excessive capital punishment - certainty of punishment matters more than its severity.

**e) Equality Before Law:**
- Same crime equals same punishment for all - no special privileges based on social status or wealth.

**f) Written Laws:**
- Clear codification required - no crime without law (nullum crimen sine lege), laws must be publicly known.

**g) Individual Responsibility:**
- Person responsible for own actions - liability requires both guilty act and guilty mind working together.

**h) Proportionality:**
- Punishment severity must match crime gravity - mathematical scale of punishments for different offenses.

---

**Criticism (5):**
- Ignores individual differences like age and mental state
- Assumes perfect rationality but many crimes are emotional
- Ignores social factors like poverty and education
- Too rigid with no flexibility for special circumstances
- Unrealistic view that everyone has equal free will

---

### **3. NEO-CLASSICAL SCHOOL (Late 18th Century)**

**Main Idea:** Classical School principles retained but flexibility added for individual circumstances.

**Key Modifications (5):**

**a) Individual Circumstances:**
- Mental state, age, and criminal history now considered - children treated differently from adults, first offenders different from repeat.

**b) Mitigation and Aggravation:**
- Mitigating factors reduce punishment (mental illness, infancy, provocation, duress) - Aggravating factors increase it (premeditation, cruelty, multiple victims).

**c) Judicial Discretion:**
- Judges given power to individualize sentences - can adjust within limits based on specific case circumstances.

**d) Modified Free Will:**
- Free will acknowledged as not absolute - mental illness and circumstances can limit person's ability to choose freely.

**e) Partial Focus on Criminal:**
- Began considering the person committing act - balance between crime severity and offender's circumstances introduced.

---

**Comparison:**

| Aspect | Classical | Neo-Classical |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Free Will | Absolute | Modified by circumstances |
| Punishment | Fixed for each crime | Flexible based on factors |
| Mental State | Completely ignored | Considered and evaluated |
| Age | Not relevant | Children treated separately |

---

### **4. POSITIVIST SCHOOL (Late 19th Century)**

**Main Belief:** Crime caused by factors beyond control, not free will - study criminals scientifically like medical patients.

**Core Principles (6):**

**a) Determinism:**
- Criminal behavior determined by biology, psychology, society - person cannot help it, no free will involved.

**b) Scientific Study:**
- Use experiments, observations, measurements, statistics - evidence-based conclusions replace philosophical debates.

**c) Multiple Causes:**
- Biological (heredity, brain, genes), Psychological (mental illness, personality), Social (poverty, education, family) - all interact to produce crime.

**d) Criminals are Different:**
- Biological or psychological defects distinguish them from normal - can be identified and classified into criminal types.

**e) Focus on Criminal:**
- Study the person, not just the act - understand individual offender's characteristics and background thoroughly.

**f) Treatment not Punishment:**
- Rehabilitate through therapy, education, social reform - punishment alone doesn't work, address root causes instead.

**Two Types:**
- **Radical (Italian):** Biology causes crime - Lombroso, Ferri, Garofalo
- **Liberal (French):** Society causes crime - Gabriel Tarde

## COMPARATIVE TABLE

| Feature | Pre-Classical | Classical | Neo-Classical | Positivist |
|---------|--------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Time** | Before 1700s | 1700s | Late 1700s | 1800s |
| **Approach** | Supernatural | Rational | Modified Rational | Scientific |
| **Focus** | Divine will | Crime act | Crime + Criminal | Criminal person |
| **Free Will** | None | Absolute | Modified | Denied |
| **Cause** | Supernatural | Choice | Choice + circumstances | Bio-psycho-social |
| **Response** | Torture | Punishment | Flexible punishment | Treatment |
| **Goal** | Expiation | Deterrence | Justice | Rehabilitation |

---

## MODERN CONTRIBUTIONS

**From Classical:** No crime without law principle, proportionate punishment, due process rights, fair trial guarantees.

**From Neo-Classical:** Judicial discretion in sentencing, consideration of circumstances, different juvenile treatment, mitigating and aggravating factors.

**From Positivist:** Scientific investigation methods, rehabilitation programs, probation and parole systems, prevention through addressing root causes.

**Modern System:** Successfully blends all three approaches for balanced criminal justice.

---

## CONCLUSION

Evolution from supernatural beliefs through rationality to scientific study shows progress in understanding crime. Classical gave us rule of law, Neo-Classical added flexibility, Positivist introduced science and treatment. Modern systems integrate all three - Classical legality and proportionality, Neo-Classical individualization, Positivist scientific methods and rehabilitation. This synthesis provides comprehensive framework respecting rights while promoting reform.
