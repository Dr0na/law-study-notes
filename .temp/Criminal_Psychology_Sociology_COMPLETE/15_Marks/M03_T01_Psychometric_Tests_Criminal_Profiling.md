## INTRODUCTION

Psychometric testing measures criminal tendencies through standardized tests while criminal profiling predicts offender characteristics from crime scene evidence - both aid investigation and assessment scientifically.

---

## PART A: PSYCHOMETRIC TESTS

### Purpose (4)
- Assessment of mental state and risk level
- Prediction of re-offending likelihood for parole decisions
- Treatment planning with appropriate program design
- Research on crime patterns scientifically

---

### Major Tests (5 Categories)

**1. Intelligence Tests:**
- WAIS (Wechsler) measures IQ and cognitive abilities - low IQ linked to poor judgment but NOT cause of crime, just risk factor.

**2. Personality Tests:**
- MMPI (Minnesota) with 567 questions identifies antisocial tendencies - most widely used in forensic settings globally.
- PCL-R (Psychopathy Checklist) by Robert Hare scores 0-40 with above 30 indicating psychopathy - measures lack of empathy, manipulation, impulsivity.

**3. Projective Tests:**
- Rorschach inkblot test reveals unconscious thoughts - aggressive themes indicate violent tendencies.
- TAT (picture stories) shows psychological themes - aggression, authority conflict, interpersonal issues.

**4. Neuropsychological Tests:**
- Assess brain function and damage - frontal lobe damage causes impulsivity and poor judgment affecting behavior.

**5. Risk Assessment:**
- VRAG, HCR-20 predict future violence - guide parole and supervision decisions based on statistical risk factors.

## PART B: CRIMINAL PROFILING

**Definition:** Predicting offender characteristics from crime scene evidence - identifies likely age, gender, personality, lifestyle patterns.

---

### Types (3)

**1. Crime Scene Analysis (FBI):** Analyzes physical evidence, victim selection, weapon use, violence level, crime organization.

**2. Investigative Psychology (Canter):** Scientific statistical approach based on research data, not intuition - five aspects analyzed systematically.

**3. Geographical Profiling:** Location patterns of crimes predict where offender lives or will strike next.

---

### Process (6 Steps)

**Step 1 - Assimilate:** Collect all crime information including photos, reports, autopsy, witness statements, victimology.

**Step 2 - Classify:** Organized vs disorganized offender type, crime motive categorization, risk level assessment.

**Step 3 - Reconstruct:** Crime sequence and timeline reconstruction, understand offender's behavior during commission.

**Step 4 - Profile:** Generate offender characteristics - demographics (age, gender), psychological traits, behavioral patterns, lifestyle.

**Step 5 - Investigate:** Use profile to narrow suspects, guide interview strategies, prioritize leads.

**Step 6 - Apprehend:** Aid in capture strategy, tailor interrogation approach, elicit confession techniques.

### FBI Classification

| Feature | Organized | Disorganized |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| IQ | Above average | Below average |
| Planning | Planned | Spontaneous |
| Scene | Controlled | Chaotic |
| Victim | Targeted | Opportunity |
| Weapon | Brings own | Uses at scene |
| Evidence | Minimal left | Extensive left |
| Social | Good skills | Loner, poor skills |
| Work | Employed | Unemployed |

---

### Key Factors (3)

**1. Crime Scene:** Weapon type, force used, body positioning, items taken or left - reveals offender's skill and psychological state.

**2. Victimology:** Who targeted and why, lifestyle and risk level - high-risk victim easier, low-risk suggests skilled offender.

**3. MO vs Signature:**
- **MO (Method):** How crime done, CAN change with experience, serves functional purpose of completing crime and avoiding capture.
- **Signature:** Psychological need expressed, DOESN'T change over time, unique to offender, provides emotional gratification unnecessary for crime itself.
- **Key:** Signature more reliable for linking serial cases because it remains stable.

---

## MERITS (7)

- Narrows suspect pool saving time and resources
- Guides investigation direction and prioritizes leads effectively
- Links serial cases across jurisdictions identifying patterns
- Generates new leads predicting offender location and next moves
- Aids court testimony and risk assessment
- Helps prevention by identifying potential targets
- Improves interview and interrogation strategies

---

## DEMERITS (8)

- Lack of scientific rigor, often intuition-based rather than research
- Inaccuracy problems with vague profiles fitting many people
- Confirmation bias causing tunnel vision in investigations
- Limited applicability, works best only for serial crimes
- Resource intensive requiring expensive trained experts
- Ethical concerns about stereotyping and discrimination
- Unrealistic expectations from TV creating false impressions
- Legal issues, not admissible as primary evidence in court

---

## CONCLUSION

Psychometric tests (MMPI, PCL-R, risk assessment tools) provide objective measurement of criminal tendencies. Criminal profiling predicts offender from crime characteristics using FBI's organized vs disorganized classification, MO vs signature distinction, and systematic six-step process. While profiling has significant limitations including lack of rigorous science, inaccuracy risks, and ethical concerns, when used cautiously by trained professionals specifically for serial crimes, it can enhance investigations by narrowing suspects and guiding strategies. Both tools valuable when limitations recognized and ethical standards maintained throughout application.
