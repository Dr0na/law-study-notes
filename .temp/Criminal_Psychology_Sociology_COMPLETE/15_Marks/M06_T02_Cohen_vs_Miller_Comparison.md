## INTRODUCTION

Cohen and Miller both explain gang delinquency but fundamentally differ - Cohen says REACTIVE (reaction against middle class), Miller says PROACTIVE (expressing own independent culture).

---

## COHEN'S THEORY: REACTIVE

**Main Argument:** Lower-class boys form gangs as REACTION to status frustration experienced in middle-class schools.

**Key Concepts (3):**

**1. Middle-Class Measuring Rod:**
- Schools judge all students by middle-class standards universally - lower-class boys lack these values and skills systematically failing.

**2. Status Frustration:**
- Frustration from repeated school failure and rejection - humiliation and feelings of inadequacy build up in boys.

**3. Reaction Formation:**
- Overreact in opposite direction, INVERT middle-class values completely - create opposite value system expressing hostility toward what rejected them.

---

**Subculture Characteristics (6):**
- Non-utilitarian: Not for money, vandalism and joyriding bring no material benefit
- Malicious: Spiteful toward middle-class symbols and institutions
- Negativistic: Complete opposite of middle-class values deliberately
- Versatile: Variety of crimes without specialization
- Short-run hedonism: Immediate pleasure, no future planning
- Group autonomy: Gang loyalty, anti-authority stance

**Status Through:** Toughness, daring crimes, defying authority, gang loyalty - replaces academic achievement as status source.

---

## MILLER'S THEORY: PROACTIVE

**Main Argument:** Lower-class culture DISTINCT and INDEPENDENT with own values - gang delinquency is normal expression, NOT reaction.

**Key Difference:** NOT reacting to middle class, THEIR OWN autonomous culture naturally produces delinquency when youth conform to it.

---

### Six Focal Concerns (T-T-S-E-F-A)

**1. Trouble:**
- Getting into and out of trouble is dominant concern - ambivalent because brings status but also punishment risk.

**2. Toughness:**
- Physical prowess and masculinity highly valued - prove "real man" status especially important when no male role models at home.

**3. Smartness:**
- Street smarts and ability to con, NOT academic intelligence - cunning, hustling, outwitting others brings respect.

**4. Excitement:**
- Seeking thrills and avoiding monotonous boredom - gambling, drinking, fighting because daily life otherwise routine.

**5. Fate:**
- Life controlled by fate and luck, not personal effort - "what will be, will be" attitude, cannot control destiny anyway.

**6. Autonomy:**
- Freedom from authority and control desired - "nobody tells me what to do," resentment of bosses, teachers, police.

---

**Miller's Point:** Boys NOT reacting but EXPRESSING their cultural values learned from birth naturally.

## COMPREHENSIVE COMPARISON

| Aspect | Cohen (Reactive) | Miller (Proactive) |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Basic Cause** | Reaction to status frustration | Expression of own culture |
| **Lower-Class Culture** | Want same as middle class (can't get) | Have own distinct independent values |
| **Origin** | Status frustration in school | Normal cultural socialization |
| **Values** | Inversion of middle-class values | Independent focal concerns |
| **Lower Class Wants** | Middle-class success (blocked) | Own distinct values (don't want middle-class) |
| **Delinquency** | Reactive rebellion | Proactive cultural expression |
| **Solution** | Provide alternative status paths | Provide legal outlets for values |
| **Tone** | Sympathetic victims of system | Autonomous cultural group |

---

## EXAMPLE: SCHOOL VANDALISM

**Cohen:** Boys frustrated by failure, school represents rejection, vandalism is revenge and malicious rebellion - attack on symbol of humiliation.

**Miller:** Boys seeking excitement (focal concern), demonstrating toughness, defying authority (autonomy) - normal cultural expression, not necessarily hostile or reactive.

---

## POLICY IMPLICATIONS

**Cohen's Approach (4):**
- Change schools with multiple pathways, provide alternative status opportunities through sports and arts, reduce inequality through early intervention, respect diverse backgrounds beyond academic.

**Miller's Approach (4):**
- Accept cultural differences as valid, provide LEGAL outlets for focal concerns expression, don't try imposing middle-class values forcefully, economic opportunities valuing practical skills.

---

## WHICH IS RIGHT?

**Both Partly Correct:** Some gangs form from status frustration (Cohen), others express cultural values (Miller) - different gangs have different causes, context and circumstances matter, modern research finds elements of both.

---

## CONCLUSION

Cohen says lower-class WANTS middle-class success but can't achieve it causing reactive value inversion. Miller says lower-class HAS own independent values and simply follows them proactively. Fundamental question: Does lower class want what middle class has (Cohen) or have its own genuinely different values (Miller)? Modern understanding integrates both - some delinquency reflects frustrated status aspirations while other aspects express genuine cultural differences. Effective policy must provide legitimate status opportunities (Cohen) while respecting cultural diversity and providing legal value outlets (Miller) balancing recognition with cultural authenticity for addressing gang delinquency comprehensively.
