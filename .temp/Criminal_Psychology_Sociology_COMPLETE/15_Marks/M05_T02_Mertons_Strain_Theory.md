## INTRODUCTION

Robert Merton (1910-2003) developed Strain Theory in 1938 explaining that crime happens when there's gap between what society tells people to achieve and opportunities actually available.

---

## FOUNDATION

**Durkheim's Anomie (1897):**
- Anomie means normlessness - social norms break down during rapid change causing deviance.

**Merton's Adaptation:**
- Modified for American society - focused on gap between cultural goals and institutional means creating strain.

---

## MERTON'S THEORY (2 Components)

**1. Cultural Goals:**
- Society tells EVERYONE to be financially successful - "American Dream" ideology where success equals personal worth.

**2. Institutional Means:**
- Legitimate ways to succeed like education, hard work, career advancement - but NOT equally available to all.

---

## THE PROBLEM: STRAIN

**Merton's Key Insight:**
- Society emphasizes goals for everyone but doesn't provide equal means - this gap creates STRAIN (pressure and frustration).

**Example:** Society says "Be rich!" but reality for poor is "No education, no job, no opportunities" - resulting strain may lead to crime.

---

## FIVE MODES OF ADAPTATION (5)

People respond to strain in five different ways:

---

### **MODE 1: CONFORMITY (✅ Goals | ✅ Means)**

- Accept goals AND use legitimate means - work hard legally to achieve success, most common response, law-abiding.

**Example:** Student studies, gets degree, finds job legally.

**Result:** No crime.

---

### **MODE 2: INNOVATION (✅ Goals | ❌ Means)**

- Accept goals BUT use illegal means to achieve them - MOST RELEVANT TO CRIME, explains most property offenses.

**Why:** Blocked legitimate opportunities, poverty, no education, faster results through illegal methods.

**Examples (5):**
- Theft - want money, steal it
- Drug dealing - want wealth, sell drugs
- Fraud - want more, use deception
- Robbery - want money, take by force
- White-collar crime - want more, use illegal corporate methods

**Two Types:**
- Lower-class innovators turn to street crime
- Middle/upper-class innovators turn to white-collar crime

**Result:** Property crime, organized crime, corporate crime.

---

### **MODE 3: RITUALISM (❌ Goals | ✅ Means)**

- Give up on success goals BUT follow rules rigidly - lower aspirations to avoid failure, overly conformist behavior.

**Example:** Bureaucrat with no ambition who just follows procedures mechanically.

**Result:** Usually not criminal, just gave up trying.

---

### **MODE 4: RETREATISM (❌ Goals | ❌ Means)**

- Reject both goals and means completely - withdraw from society, least common adaptation.

**Who:** Drug addicts, alcoholics, homeless, mentally ill dropouts.

**Why:** Failed at both legitimate and illegitimate means - double failure leads to complete withdrawal.

**Result:** Drug crimes, vagrancy, minor survival offenses.

---

### **MODE 5: REBELLION (🔄 Goals | 🔄 Means)**

- Reject existing system AND replace with new goals and means - want to change society fundamentally, not just adapt.

**Who:** Revolutionaries, political terrorists, radical reformers.

**Result:** Political violence, riots, armed rebellion against state.

**Unique Feature:** Only mode trying to change the system itself.

## SUMMARY TABLE

| Mode | Goals | Means | Result | Example |
|------|-------|-------|--------|---------|
| Conformity | ✅ | ✅ | No crime | Student works hard |
| Innovation | ✅ | ❌ | **CRIME** | Theft, fraud |
| Ritualism | ❌ | ✅ | Usually no crime | Bureaucrat |
| Retreatism | ❌ | ❌ | Drug crimes | Addict |
| Rebellion | 🔄 | 🔄 | Political violence | Revolutionary |

---

## CRITICAL ANALYSIS

**Strengths (4):**
- Links crime to social structure not individual pathology
- Explains class differences in crime rates scientifically
- Explains both street crime and white-collar crime
- Provides policy implications for social reform

**Limitations (4):**
- Doesn't explain why most poor people don't commit crime
- Difficult to measure "strain" empirically and precisely
- Assumes everyone accepts same cultural goals
- Doesn't explain violent crime adequately

---

## MODERN EXTENSIONS

**General Strain Theory (Agnew, 1992):**
- Broadened beyond just economic goals - added three types: failure to achieve goals, loss of positive things, exposure to negative things.

---

## CONCLUSION

Merton's theory explains crime as rational response when society creates gap between what it tells people to achieve (success for all) and opportunities it provides (education and jobs unequally distributed). Innovation mode using illegal means to achieve legal goals explains most acquisitive crime. Theory shows crime is social structural problem requiring social solutions like providing genuine opportunities, not just individual moral problem requiring punishment. Understanding strain helps develop prevention addressing root causes of inequality and blocked opportunities.
