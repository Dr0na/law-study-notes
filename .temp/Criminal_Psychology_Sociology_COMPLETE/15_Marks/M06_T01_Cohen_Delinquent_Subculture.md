## INTRODUCTION

Albert Cohen (1918-2014) in "Delinquent Boys" (1955) explained why lower-class boys form gangs committing non-utilitarian crimes like vandalism and fighting—crimes bringing no money or material benefit.

## THE PROBLEM: STATUS FRUSTRATION

### Middle-Class Measuring Rod

**Concept:** Schools judge all students by middle-class standards - evaluation system designed for middle-class children applied universally.

**Middle-Class Values Expected:** Ambition and future planning, academic achievement, good manners, respect for property, verbal skills, non-violence.

**Lower-Class Reality:** Live in present focused on immediate needs, survival focus not achievement, physical toughness valued, limited vocabulary, direct communication style.

---

### Lower-Class Boys in School

**What Happens:** Family hasn't prepared them for middle-class expectations, lack required values and skills, teachers judge by middle-class standards - SYSTEMATIC FAILURE results.

**Consequences:** Poor grades and academic failure, teacher disapproval and negative labeling, rejection by middle-class peers, feelings of inadequacy and humiliation.

---

### Status Frustration Defined

> Frustration from failing to achieve status in middle-class institutions, particularly schools.

**Process:** Lower-class boys → Middle-class school → Judged by standards they can't meet → FAILURE and humiliation → STATUS FRUSTRATION builds.

---

## THE SOLUTION: DELINQUENT SUBCULTURE

### Formation (4 Steps)

**Step 1:** Many boys face same frustration - share common problem of school failure and rejection.

**Step 2:** Come together to form gangs - find others with similar struggles and experiences.

**Step 3:** Reaction Formation - overreact in opposite direction to what frustrated them, INVERT middle-class values completely creating opposite value system.

**Step 4:** New Status System created - status now gained through delinquency not achievement, gang provides alternative recognition and respect.

## CHARACTERISTICS (6)

**1. Non-Utilitarian:**
- Crime NOT for money or material gain - vandalism brings no benefit, joyriding just for fun, fighting without profit motive.
- Purpose is rejecting middle-class values, not economic gain.

**2. Malicious:**
- Acts seem spiteful aimed at middle class - deliberately attacking symbols of what rejected them like school property.

**3. Negativistic:**
- Values complete OPPOSITE of middle-class - inversion not just rejection, everything middle class values they devalue and vice versa.

| Middle-Class Value | Subculture Value |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Respect property | Destroy property |
| Academic achievement | Reject education |
| Politeness | Disrespect |
| Plan future | Live for now |

**4. Versatile:**
- Variety of crimes without specialization - theft today, vandalism tomorrow, not professional criminals focusing on one type.

**5. Short-Run Hedonism:**
- Immediate pleasure focus without long-term planning - live for moment, no concern for future consequences.

**6. Group Autonomy:**
- Strong gang loyalty and resistance to authority - "Us vs Them" mentality, gang becomes substitute family.

## STATUS ACHIEVEMENT

**Middle-Class:** Good grades, career success, material possessions bring respect and status.

**Delinquent Subculture:** Physical toughness, daring criminal acts, defying authority successfully, loyalty to gang bring respect and status.

## COHEN VS MERTON

| Aspect | Merton | Cohen |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Goal Sought | Monetary success | Status and respect |
| Crime Type | Utilitarian (theft for money) | Non-utilitarian (vandalism) |
| Class | All classes | Lower-class boys specifically |
| Solution | Individual innovation | Collective gang subculture |
| Purpose | Achieve material success | Reject middle-class values |

---

## POLICY IMPLICATIONS (4)

**1. Change Schools:** Multiple pathways to success not just academic, vocational education alongside traditional, don't judge all by same standard.

**2. Alternative Status:** Sports where physical skills valued, arts and music programs, youth clubs - legitimate ways to gain respect.

**3. Reduce Inequality:** Early childhood programs preparing for school, better support for disadvantaged families bridging class gap.

**4. Community Programs:** After-school activities with supervision, structured recreation, skill-building opportunities for youth.

---

## CRITICISM (4)

- Not all lower-class boys form gangs, many succeed in school
- Some gang crime IS utilitarian like drug dealing for money
- Theory ignores female delinquency completely, only about boys
- Hard to measure "status frustration" concept empirically

---

## CONCLUSION

Cohen's theory explains gang delinquency as collective solution to status frustration experienced in middle-class institutions. Lower-class boys systematically failing in schools form gangs with inverted values where delinquency brings status replacing academic achievement. Six characteristics—non-utilitarian, malicious, negativistic, versatile, hedonistic, autonomous—capture essence of gang culture as reaction against middle-class rejection. Policy should provide alternative legitimate paths to status and respect for all youth, not just those succeeding by middle-class academic standards, addressing root cause of status frustration through inclusive recognition systems.
