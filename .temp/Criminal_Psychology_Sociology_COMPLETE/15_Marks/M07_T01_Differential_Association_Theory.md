## INTRODUCTION

Edwin Sutherland (1883-1950), "Dean of American Criminology," developed Differential Association Theory in 1939 proposing that criminal behavior is learned through social interaction, not inherited.

---

## CORE PROPOSITION

> Criminal behavior is LEARNED through interaction with others, just like any other behavior.

**Key Points:** Crime NOT inherited, NOT instinctive, LEARNED through normal social processes.

---

## THE NINE PROPOSITIONS

---

### **PROPOSITION 1: Criminal Behavior is Learned**

- Crime is learned, not inherited - not biological trait passed through genes, anyone can learn if exposed properly.

---

### **PROPOSITION 2: Learned through Communication**

- Learning occurs through interaction and communication - includes verbal (talking) and non-verbal (gestures, actions) in two-way process.

---

### **PROPOSITION 3: Learning in Intimate Groups**

**Main Point:** Most important learning happens in close personal groups.

- Family, close friends, gang members have strongest influence - face-to-face contact most powerful for learning crime.
- Media and casual acquaintances have much less influence - intimate relationships matter most for behavioral learning.

---

### **PROPOSITION 4: Learning Includes Techniques AND Attitudes**

**Two Things Learned:**

**(a) TECHNIQUES (How):**
- How to pick locks, sell drugs, forge documents, avoid capture - practical skills needed to commit crimes successfully.

**(b) ATTITUDES (Why):**
- Justifications like "Rich deserve it" or "Everyone does it" - rationalizations that make crime seem acceptable or justified.

**Both Needed:** Techniques alone insufficient without motivation, attitudes alone insufficient without skills to act.

---

### **PROPOSITION 5: Learning Definitions**

**Two Types:**

- **Favorable to Crime:** "Laws are unfair," "Snitches get stitches" - make law violation seem acceptable or justified.
- **Unfavorable to Crime:** "Crime is wrong," "Obey law," "Honesty important" - support conventional law-abiding behavior.

---

### **PROPOSITION 6: THE PRINCIPLE (Core)**

> Person commits crime when exposed to MORE pro-crime definitions than anti-crime definitions.

**Think of Balance:**
```
Pro-Crime Definitions  vs  Anti-Crime Definitions
           ⚖️
If Pro-Crime heavier → CRIME
If Anti-Crime heavier → CONFORMITY
```

**This is the heart of theory!**

---

### **PROPOSITION 7: Associations Vary (FPDI)**

**Four Dimensions:**

- **F - Frequency:** How often exposed - daily contact stronger than occasional, repetition reinforces learning.
- **D - Duration:** How long exposure lasts - years of association stronger than brief encounters create deeper impact.
- **P - Priority:** How early in life - childhood exposures MOST important, first learned has strongest lasting effect.
- **I - Intensity:** Importance of source - family and close friends strongest, strangers and media weakest influence.

**Example:** Criminal father (frequent daily, long duration, from childhood, most important person) → Very likely criminal child.

---

### **PROPOSITION 8: All Learning Mechanisms**

- Uses same mechanisms as any other learning - classical conditioning, reinforcement, observation just like learning language or skill.

---

### **PROPOSITION 9: Same Needs, Different Methods**

- Everyone has same needs (money, status, excitement) - but some learn legal ways, others learn criminal ways to meet needs.
- Need doesn't explain crime - LEARNING determines which method person chooses to meet universal human needs.

---

## VISUAL SUMMARY

```
Person exposed to definitions
        ↓
Pro-Crime (from criminals) vs Anti-Crime (from law-abiding)
        ↓
Ratio determines behavior
        ↓
If Pro > Anti → CRIME
```

---

## POLICY IMPLICATIONS (4)

**1. Prevent Criminal Associations:**
- Break up gangs, separate delinquents - don't mix juveniles with adult criminals in prisons ("criminal university").

**2. Increase Pro-Social Associations:**
- Mentorship programs, positive role models - community involvement and conventional peer groups build prosocial values.

**3. Change Attitudes:**
- Challenge pro-criminal beliefs through education - cognitive therapy helps restructure thinking patterns away from crime.

**4. Strengthen Families:**
- Parenting programs and early intervention - family is primary socialization agent requiring support.

---

## CRITICISM (4)

**1. Hard to Test:**
- Difficult to measure "excess of definitions" empirically - vague concept lacks precise measurement tools.

**2. First Criminal Problem:**
- If crime is learned, who taught the first criminal ever - logical problem with pure learning theory.

**3. Ignores Individual Differences:**
- Same associations produce different outcomes - why do some resist criminal influence while others succumb.

**4. Circular Reasoning:**
- "Why crime?" "Learned it" "How know?" "Committed crime" - tautological argument difficult to falsify scientifically.

---

## CONCLUSION

Differential Association Theory revolutionized criminology by proving criminal behavior is learned through social interaction in intimate groups. Nine propositions explain how excess exposure to pro-criminal definitions leads to crime. While facing measurement challenges, theory provides foundation for modern social learning theories and practical prevention focusing on changing associations, strengthening prosocial bonds, and challenging pro-criminal attitudes. Core insight that crime is learned behavior, not inherited trait, guides contemporary rehabilitation and prevention programs.
