## INTRODUCTION

Travis Hirschi (1935-2017) asked different question in "Causes of Delinquency" (1969): not "Why do people commit crime?" but "Why DON'T people commit crime?" Answer: strong social bonds prevent crime.

---

## FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION

**Hirschi's Insight:** Crime is easy and tempting, human nature is selfish - real puzzle is why people obey law, not why they break it.

> When social bonds are weak, people are FREE to commit crime.

## FOUR ELEMENTS OF SOCIAL BOND (A-C-I-B)

---

### **1. ATTACHMENT**

**Definition:** Emotional bond to others like parents, teachers, friends, spouse - sensitivity to their opinions matters.

**Strong Attachment:**
- Care what they think, don't want to disappoint them, fear losing respect - result is conformity to avoid hurting relationships.

**Weak Attachment:**
- Don't care about others, nothing to lose emotionally, no fear of disappointing anyone - result is freedom to commit crime.

**Most Important:** Parental attachment - quality of relationship matters more than whether parents present, strong bond with parents strongly prevents delinquency.

---

### **2. COMMITMENT**

**Definition:** Investment in conventional life like education, career, reputation - rational stake in conformity, something to lose.

**High Commitment:**
- Much invested through years of education and career building, good reputation to maintain, future prospects at stake - too risky to commit crime, too much to lose.

**Low Commitment:**
- Nothing invested in future, no career prospects or qualifications, no reputation to lose - nothing holding back from crime, nothing to risk.

**Example:** Medical student in final year won't risk crime (5 years invested, career at stake) vs school dropout with no prospects (little to lose).

---

### **3. INVOLVEMENT**

**Definition:** Time and energy spent in conventional activities - busy with legitimate pursuits like school, work, hobbies.

**Principle:** "Idle hands are devil's workshop"

**High Involvement:**
- Schedule fully occupied with school, work, activities, tired at end of day - no time or opportunity for delinquency.

**Low Involvement:**
- Much unstructured free time, bored and idle, hanging out with nothing to do - time and opportunity for crime available.

**Research:** Youth heavily involved in conventional activities commit significantly less crime.

---

### **4. BELIEF**

**Definition:** Acceptance of conventional morality - belief that rules should be obeyed, internalized moral values.

**Strong Belief:**
- Law is legitimate and just, rules should be obeyed, crime is morally wrong - conform because it's right thing to do morally.

**Weak Belief:**
- Law not legitimate, rules are unjust or unfair, crime not necessarily wrong - no moral constraint operating against crime.

**Key:** Not about fear of punishment (external) but internalized morality (internal) guiding behavior voluntarily.

## HOW BONDS PREVENT CRIME

```
STRONG BONDS → Don't hurt loved ones + Too much to lose + No time + Morally wrong → CONFORMITY

WEAK BONDS → Don't care + Nothing to lose + Free time + No morality → FREE TO COMMIT CRIME
```

---

## EMPIRICAL SUPPORT

**Strong Research Evidence:**
- Attachment to parents reduces delinquency significantly
- Educational commitment lowers offending rates measurably
- Activity involvement protective factor proven
- Belief in rules strongly predicts conformity

**One of most tested and supported theories in all of criminology.**

---

## POLICY IMPLICATIONS (4)

**1. Strengthen Attachment:** Family programs, parent-child bonding, mentorship with positive adults.

**2. Increase Commitment:** Education opportunities, job training, career counseling - help youth invest in conventional future.

**3. Increase Involvement:** After-school programs, sports leagues, arts programs - keep youth busy and engaged productively.

**4. Strengthen Belief:** Moral education, character development, fair rules, legitimate authority - build internal moral values.

---

## CRITICISM (4)

**1. Causal Order:** Do weak bonds cause crime or does crime weaken bonds - direction unclear, might be reciprocal.

**2. Criminal Bonds:** Ignores attachment to criminal friends and commitment to criminal career - theory incomplete.

**3. Tautological:** Circular reasoning - weak bonds defined by crime, crime explained by weak bonds.

**4. Ignores Motivation:** Doesn't explain why people WANT to commit crime initially - assumes crime naturally attractive to everyone.

---

## CONCLUSION

Social Bond Theory explains conformity through four elements: attachment (emotional bonds), commitment (investment in future), involvement (busy with activities), belief (internalized morality). Strong bonds prevent crime, weak bonds allow it. Theory has excellent empirical support and provides practical prevention guidance through strengthening family bonds, educational commitment, structured activities, and moral development. While facing some criticisms regarding causation and circularity, practical applications in youth programs and community interventions demonstrate enduring value of bonding approach to crime prevention.
