## HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

### Abroad

**Hugo Münsterberg (1863-1916):**
- "Father of Forensic Psychology" with book "On the Witness Stand" (1908) - studied eyewitness testimony, memory reliability, deception detection pioneering field.

**Timeline:**
- 1910s-1920s: Psychology begins entering courtrooms with expert testimony
- 1960s-1970s: FBI develops criminal profiling, Behavioral Science Unit established 1972
- 1980s-Present: Field professionalizes with academic programs and evidence-based practices

---

### In India

**Development Stages:**
- Pre-independence: Very limited under British rule, minimal mental health consideration
- 1950s-1990s: Slow growth, mostly academic interest, few practitioners
- 2000s-Present: Gradual increase with growing recognition

**Institutions:** CBI, NCRB, Forensic Science Labs, NICFS Delhi.

**Challenges:** Limited training programs, few dedicated positions, need increased awareness and resources.

**Legal Framework:** Section 84 IPC (insanity), Section 328-330 CrPC (mental illness procedures), Section 45 Evidence Act (expert opinion), Mental Healthcare Act 2017.

## APPLICATION 1: INVESTIGATION (5 Roles)

**1. Criminal Profiling:**
- Analyze crime scene evidence systematically, predict offender demographics and psychology, narrow suspect pool efficiently - best for serial murders, rapes, arson.

**2. Interview Techniques:**
- Cognitive Interview enhances witness memory through context reinstatement and varied recall perspectives
- Reid Technique uses nine-phase interrogation to elicit confessions (though criticized for false confession risk)

**3. Polygraph (Lie Detection):**
- Measures heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, sweating assuming lying causes stress → physiological changes
- India status: NOT admissible as evidence, requires consent (Selvi v. State 2010), can be beaten by training or drugs

**4. Psychological Autopsy:**
- Determines suicide vs homicide vs accident when unclear, interviews family and reviews documents to reconstruct mental state before death

**5. Statement Analysis:**
- Assesses witness credibility and truthfulness, distinguishes real memories from fabricated through content analysis

---

## APPLICATION 2: COURT (4 Roles)

**1. Expert Witness:**
- Testifies on mental state, competency, responsibility, risk assessment, sentencing factors - requires advanced degree and forensic training.

**2. Competency to Stand Trial:**
- Assesses accused's PRESENT ability to understand proceedings and assist defense
- Criteria (5): Understand proceedings, understand consequences, communicate with lawyer, assist in defense, make rational decisions
- Outcome: Competent (trial proceeds), Incompetent (treatment to restore), Never competent (alternative procedures)

**3. Criminal Responsibility:**
- Section 84 IPC evaluates unsoundness of mind at time of offense
- Assessment: Was accused mentally ill? Could they understand nature or wrongfulness of act?
- Psychologist evaluates retrospectively and currently with diagnosis and causal link

**4. Eyewitness Testimony:**
- Factors affecting accuracy: Stress impairs memory (weapon focus), time delay causes forgetting, leading questions create false memories, cross-race identification harder
- Key point: Witness confidence does NOT equal accuracy despite common belief

---

## APPLICATION 3: PRISON (6 Roles)

**1. Classification:**
- Match inmates to appropriate security level (maximum, medium, minimum, open) - assesses security risk, mental health needs, program suitability ensuring safety.

**2. Treatment Programs:**
- Cognitive-behavioral therapy targets criminal thinking, anger management for violent offenders, sex offender treatment reducing recidivism, substance abuse programs addressing addiction.

**3. Mental Health Services:**
- Prevalence 3-4 times higher than general population requires screening, individual/group therapy, medication management, crisis intervention when needed.

**4. Suicide Prevention:**
- Risk factors: mental illness especially depression, first-time incarceration shock, solitary confinement, life sentences, victimization by others
- Prevention: Screen high-risk at intake, regular monitoring, remove hazards, crisis procedures, peer support programs

**5. Managing Difficult Inmates:**
- Violent inmates need anger management and special housing, mentally ill require psychiatric treatment, gang members need separation, sexual predators protective custody

**6. Release Preparation:**
- Vocational training and life skills development, psychological preparation for freedom adjustment, family reintegration counseling, community linkages including halfway houses

## CONCLUSION

Forensic Psychology provides vital expertise across three domains: investigation (profiling, interviews, lie detection), courts (expert testimony, competency evaluation, eyewitness assessment), prisons (classification, treatment, mental health services). Historical development from Münsterberg's pioneering work to modern evidence-based practice demonstrates field maturation. In India, while still developing compared to West, field shows promise with growing institutional support and recognition. Despite resource constraints and training limitations, forensic psychology enhances criminal justice effectiveness through scientific understanding of behavior, comprehensive assessment capabilities, and evidence-based intervention development throughout justice system operations.
