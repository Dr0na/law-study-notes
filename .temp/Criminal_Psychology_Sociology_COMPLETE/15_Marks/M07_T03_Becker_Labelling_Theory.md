## INTRODUCTION

Howard Becker (1928-2023) in "Outsiders" (1963) shifted focus from "Why crime?" to "How are people LABELED as criminals?" Deviance is not inherent in acts but created by society's reactions and labeling.

---

## CORE PROPOSITIONS (2)

**1. Deviance Not Inherent:**
- No act is naturally criminal - society decides what's criminal, definitions change by place and time.
- Example: Alcohol legal in India but illegal in Saudi Arabia, marijuana legal in some US states but illegal in India.

**2. Labelling Creates Deviance:**
- Society creates deviance by making rules and applying them to certain people - labeling process itself produces deviant identity and behavior.

## PRIMARY VS SECONDARY DEVIANCE

**Concept by Edwin Lemert**

---

### **PRIMARY DEVIANCE**

**Definition:** Initial minor rule-breaking, not part of person's identity - experimental and situational behavior.

**Characteristics:**
- First-time or occasional offense, easily rationalized
- Not central to self-concept or how person sees themselves
- Most people commit some primary deviance in life
- Doesn't lead to criminal identity if not caught

**Examples:** Teenager shoplifts once, student cheats on exam, person tries drugs once.

**Outcome:** If not caught and labeled, person usually stops and returns to normal conforming behavior.

---

### **SECONDARY DEVIANCE**

**Definition:** Deviant behavior becomes part of identity after being labeled - criminal role becomes master status defining person.

**Process:**
```
Primary Deviance → CAUGHT & LABELED ("criminal") → Treated as deviant → Internalize label → Identity changes ("I AM criminal") → SECONDARY DEVIANCE (lifestyle) → Criminal career
```

**Characteristics:**
- Repeated crimes become pattern, crime central to identity
- Adopt criminal lifestyle and join deviant groups
- Very hard to stop once identity formed

---

## MASTER STATUS

**Definition:** Label that overrides all other characteristics and identities a person has.

**Example:** Person is father, employee, volunteer but gets convicted - labeled "criminal" becomes master status overriding everything, everyone sees them as criminal FIRST, other positive identities fade away.

**Effect:** Becomes self-fulfilling prophecy creating the reality it describes.

---

## LABELLING PROCESS (6 Stages)

**Stage 1 - Rule-Breaking:** Many break rules but not all caught - random or selective enforcement.

**Stage 2 - Detection:** Depends on power (rich escape, poor caught), race, class, visibility, police practices.

**Stage 3 - Labelling:** Formal (arrest, conviction, record) and Informal (reputation, gossip, exclusion).

**Stage 4 - Status Degradation:** Court proceedings and prison strip old identity, assign criminal identity publicly.

**Stage 5 - Accept Label:** Person sees self as criminal, others treat as criminal, opportunities close, forced to associate with other criminals.

**Stage 6 - Secondary Deviance:** Crime becomes way of life, criminal career begins, hard to return to conventional life.

---

## SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY

**How Label Creates Reality:**

- Employers won't hire ex-convicts → No job → Poverty → Back to crime for survival
- Schools expel labeled students → No education → No opportunities → Turn to crime
- Family may reject → No support → Join gang for belonging → More crime
- Police watch closely → Caught again easily → Cycle reinforces itself

**Result:** Label creates the very criminal behavior it describes.

---

## WHO GETS LABELED?

**Key Factors (5):**
- Social class - poor more likely labeled than rich who can afford lawyers
- Race and ethnicity - minorities face higher labeling rates
- Age - youth caught more but sometimes diverted
- Appearance and demeanor - stereotypes about "criminal look" affect outcomes
- Context - same act in different settings produces different labels

**Point:** Not just what you do, but WHO you are determines labeling.

---

## DEVIANCE AMPLIFICATION

**Definition:** Societal reaction INCREASES deviance instead of reducing it - spiral effect.

**Example:** Youth shoplifts once (minor) → Expelled, labeled "thief" → Can't get job → Joins gang → Serious crimes → Career criminal. Minor act amplified into criminal career through labeling process.

---

## POLICY IMPLICATIONS (5)

**1. Avoid Labelling:** Divert youth from system when possible, handle minor offenses informally.

**2. Decriminalization:** Remove criminal labels for minor acts, use civil penalties instead.

**3. No Imprisonment:** Community programs avoid stigma of incarceration and criminal record.

**4. Reintegrative Shaming:** Shame the ACT not the PERSON, forgive and reintegrate, don't permanently stigmatize.

**5. Seal Records:** Remove criminal records after time passes, give genuine second chance for reintegration.

---

## CRITICISM (4)

- Doesn't explain WHY first crime committed, only explains secondary deviance after labeling
- Overstates labeling effect, many overcome labels successfully through resilience
- Romanticizes deviance, portrays criminals as victims while ignoring real victims of crime
- Works better for minor deviance, doesn't explain serious violence well

---

## CONCLUSION

Labelling Theory shows societal reaction can create career criminals from minor offenders. When labeled, treated as criminal, and denied opportunities, person adopts criminal identity (secondary deviance). Label becomes self-fulfilling prophecy through master status, stigmatization, and deviance amplification spiral. Policy favors diversion, decriminalization, and reintegration over harsh labeling and punishment. Theory reminds us that criminal justice intervention can paradoxically increase crime if it creates permanent stigma, so interventions must consider long-term identity effects and provide pathways back to conventional life.
