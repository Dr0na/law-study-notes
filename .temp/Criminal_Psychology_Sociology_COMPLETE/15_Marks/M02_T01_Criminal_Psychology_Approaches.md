## INTRODUCTION

Criminal Psychology studies criminal mind and behavior applying psychological knowledge to understand, investigate, and prevent crime through three main approaches.

---

## MEANING AND PURPOSE

**Definition:** Study of mental processes, motivations, and behavior of criminals - combines theory with practical application.

**Etymology:** Greek "psuchi" (soul/mind) + "logos" (study) - literally means study of mind/soul.

**Purpose (4):**
- Find WHY someone committed crime through psychological analysis
- Understand reactions during and after crime commission
- Assist police and courts in investigations
- Predict future behavior and assess risk of re-offending

**Scope:** Investigation, court testimony, prison rehabilitation, police training, victim counseling, risk assessment.

## THREE APPROACHES

---

### **APPROACH 1: PSYCHOANALYTICAL**

**Founded By:** Sigmund Freud

**Focus:** Unconscious mind and early childhood experiences determine personality and behavior patterns.

---

#### Freud's Personality Structure (3)

**ID:**
- Primitive drives present at birth, unconscious biological needs (food, sex, sleep) - operates on Pleasure Principle seeking immediate satisfaction, impulsive and demanding.

**EGO:**
- Develops after Id as mediator, conscious and unconscious functions - operates on Reality Principle adapting desires to practical reality, rational and considers consequences.

**SUPEREGO:**
- Moral conscience developing through socialization, internalizes values from parents and society - operates on Morality Principle guiding toward moral behavior, creates guilt when violated.

---

#### Crime from Imbalance (3)

**Overdeveloped Id:** Strong primitive urges, weak Ego control, weak Superego provides no guilt - results in impulsive violent crimes without remorse.

**Underdeveloped Superego:** No moral conscience developed, no guilt feelings after wrongdoing - results in psychopathic behavior and repeated offending.

**Overdeveloped Superego:** Excessive guilt and need for punishment, unconscious desire for punishment - results in crime as self-punishment mechanism.

**Freud's Summary:** Criminal is aggressive, frustrated person dominated by childhood events shaping personality.

---

#### Other Theorists (2)

**Alfred Adler - Inferiority Complex:**
- Physical defects, ugly appearance, low social status create inferiority complex - crime compensates for inadequacy, attempt to prove superiority and gain recognition.

**August Aichorn - Faulty Parenting:**
- Both extremes harmful: parental neglect (no love) makes child feel unloved leading to antisocial behavior, over-indulgence (too much love) spoils child who cannot accept limits leading to crime - balance essential, criminal parents influence children negatively.

---

### **APPROACH 2: PSYCHOLOGICAL**

**Focus:** Observable behavior rather than unconscious mind - scientific, measurable, testable approach.

**Characteristics:**
- Uses experiments and psychological tests for objectivity
- Studies what can be observed and measured directly
- Emphasizes learning, conditioning, cognition processes
- Less focus on unconscious and distant childhood
- More focus on current behavior and environmental factors

---

### **APPROACH 3: BEHAVIOURIST**

**Main Idea:** Criminal behavior learned and reinforced through group behavior systems.

**Focus Areas:**
- How groups coordinate criminal activity together
- How criminal behavior learned and reinforced socially
- How environment shapes criminal conduct patterns
- Mutual cooperation among criminals in groups

**Characteristics (4):**
- Individual or group participation in crimes
- Common behavior patterns shared across offenders
- Joint cooperation essential for organized crime
- Social reinforcement maintains criminal behavior

## COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

| Aspect | Psychoanalytical | Psychological | Behaviourist |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Focus** | Unconscious mind | Observable behavior | Group behavior |
| **Method** | Therapy, case studies | Experiments, tests | Pattern observation |
| **Cause** | Personality conflict | Learned behavior | Group reinforcement |
| **Childhood** | Crucial determinant | Important not sole | Less emphasized |
| **Treatment** | Psychotherapy | Behavior modification | Social restructuring |
| **Level** | Individual internal | Individual behavioral | Group/social |

---

## APPLICATIONS

**Investigation:** Understanding criminal motivation, profiling offenders, developing interview and interrogation strategies tailored to psychology.

**Courts:** Expert testimony on mental state, competency evaluation, criminal responsibility assessment, sentencing recommendations based on psychological factors.

**Prisons:** Psychological assessment of inmates, treatment program design, risk assessment for parole, rehabilitation monitoring and progress evaluation.

---

## CONCLUSION

Criminal Psychology's three approaches—psychoanalytical (unconscious conflicts, childhood), psychological (observable behavior, learning), behaviourist (group systems, reinforcement)—provide comprehensive framework for understanding criminal mind. Psychoanalytical explores deep personality structures, psychological applies scientific methods to measurable behavior, behaviourist examines social reinforcement in groups. Modern practice integrates all three recognizing crime results from complex interaction of intrapsychic conflicts, learned behaviors, and social group dynamics. Understanding these approaches enables development of effective prevention, investigation, and rehabilitation strategies based on scientific psychological knowledge rather than mere punishment alone.
