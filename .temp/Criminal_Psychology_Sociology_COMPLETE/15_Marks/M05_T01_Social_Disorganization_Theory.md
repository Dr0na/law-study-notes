## INTRODUCTION

Chicago School sociologists (1920s-1930s) developed Social Disorganization Theory explaining why certain neighborhoods have more crime than others - crime results from area characteristics not bad people.

**Key Figures:** Robert Park, Ernest Burgess, Clifford Shaw, Henry McKay.

---

## CORE CONCEPT

**Social Disorganization:** Community's inability to regulate itself and control crime - breakdown of effective social institutions and informal control mechanisms result in high crime rates.

---

## CONCENTRIC ZONE MODEL (5 Zones)

Burgess studied Chicago and identified 5 zones expanding from center:

```
[Zone I - Central Business]
[Zone II - Transition] ← HIGHEST CRIME
[Zone III - Working Class]
[Zone IV - Residential]  
[Zone V - Suburbs] ← LOWEST CRIME
```

**Zone I - Central Business:** Commercial area with offices and factories, low residential population.

**Zone II - Transition:** HIGHEST crime rate area with deteriorating buildings, recent immigrants and poorest residents, high population turnover, most socially disorganized.

**Zone III - Working Class:** Stable working-class neighborhoods, better conditions than Zone II, lower crime rates.

**Zone IV - Residential:** Middle-class homes with good conditions, low crime rates, stable families.

**Zone V - Suburbs:** Affluent suburban areas with LOWEST crime rates, highest socioeconomic status.

---

## KEY FINDING (Shaw & McKay)

> Crime stayed HIGH in Zone II even when ethnic groups completely changed over decades.

**Example:** Irish moved out, Italians moved in → Crime stayed high. Italians moved out, Polish moved in → Crime still stayed high.

**Revolutionary Insight:** NOT the people's ethnicity causing crime but the AREA characteristics - place matters more than people living there.

## CHARACTERISTICS OF DISORGANIZED AREAS (5)

**1. Residential Instability:**
- High turnover with people constantly moving - no attachment to community forms, residents don't care about neighborhood.

**2. Ethnic Heterogeneity:**
- Many different ethnic and language groups - communication barriers and mistrust, cannot unite for common goals.

**3. Economic Deprivation:**
- High poverty and unemployment rates - struggling families focused on survival, less community involvement capacity.

**4. Weak Institutions:**
- Poor quality schools and weak religious institutions - few community organizations providing social support.

**5. Physical Deterioration:**
- Dilapidated buildings and abandoned properties - "broken windows" signal lack of control and care.

## BREAKDOWN OF SOCIAL CONTROL

### What Should Happen

**Informal Social Control:** Neighbors monitor behavior, adults supervise youth, community pressure maintains standards, collective enforcement of norms.

### What Actually Happens in Disorganized Areas

- People don't know neighbors personally
- Fear prevents intervention in problems
- "Not my problem" mentality prevails
- Youth unsupervised and roam freely
- Crime increases without oversight

---

## COLLECTIVE EFFICACY (Modern Concept)

**Definition:** Social cohesion plus willingness to intervene for common good - Sampson & Raudenbush 1990s research.

**Components:**
- Social Cohesion: Trust, shared values, community feeling, strong social ties among neighbors.
- Informal Control: Willingness to intervene, monitor youth, confront troublemakers, maintain order together.

**Key Finding:** High collective efficacy → Low crime EVEN in poor areas - organization matters more than poverty alone, empowerment is protective.

---

## POLICY IMPLICATIONS (4)

**1. Increase Stability:** Home ownership programs, keep long-term residents, reduce turnover through incentives building neighborhood attachment.

**2. Strengthen Community:** Support organizations, block watch programs, community centers, religious institutions - build collective efficacy deliberately.

**3. Improve Physical Environment:** Repair buildings, better lighting, remove graffiti quickly - signal community cares and maintains control.

**4. Empower Residents:** Community policing partnerships, resident councils with decision power, local control over resources giving voice.

---

## CRITICISM (3)

- Most people in disorganized areas don't commit crime, ignores individual variation within same environment
- Focuses only on lower-class street crime, white-collar crime not explained by area characteristics
- Causal direction unclear whether disorganization causes crime or crime causes disorganization, might be reciprocal

---

## CONCLUSION

Social Disorganization Theory proves crime concentrates in areas with high turnover, poverty, weak institutions, and absent social control mechanisms. Shaw and McKay's finding that crime persists despite ethnic succession demonstrates area characteristics, not people's characteristics, drive crime rates. Modern collective efficacy concept shows organized communities overcome even economic disadvantage through social cohesion and intervention willingness. Effective crime prevention requires strengthening communities, empowering residents, building collective efficacy, and improving physical environment rather than merely arresting individuals from problem areas.
