## INTRODUCTION

Three Italian criminologists—Lombroso, Ferri, Garofalo—founded Positivist School applying scientific method to crime study, shifting focus from crime to criminal and from punishment to treatment.

---

## 1. CESARE LOMBROSO (1835-1909)

**Title:** "Father of Modern Criminology" and "Father of Criminal Anthropology"

**Book:** "The Criminal Man" (1876)

---

### Theory: Born Criminal

**Main Idea:** Criminals are BORN not made - can be identified by physical characteristics indicating biological defects.

**Atavism Theory:**
- Criminals are evolutionary throwbacks - represent earlier stage of human evolution resembling primitive humans or apes.

---

### Physical Stigmata (Signs)

**Cranial:** Abnormal skull, low forehead, large jaw, prominent cheekbones, asymmetrical face.

**Facial:** Small eyes, large ears, twisted nose, thick lips, sparse beard.

**Body:** Long arms (ape-like), excessive tattoos, abnormal teeth, extra fingers/toes.

---

### Classification (4)

**1. Born Criminals (40%):** Possess physical stigmata, cannot be reformed - biological destiny to commit crime.

**2. Insane Criminals:** Mental illness causes crime - need medical treatment, not punishment.

**3. Criminaloids:** Weak nature triggered by environment - can commit crime under certain conditions.

**4. Criminals of Passion:** Emotional crimes (love, honor) - one-time offenders, otherwise normal.

---

### Criticism (5)

- Unscientific methodology with small sample and no control group
- Physical stigmata theory completely disproved by later research
- Ignored all social factors like poverty and education
- Too deterministic, removed personal responsibility completely
- Ethical issues including stereotyping based on appearance

**Contribution:** Introduced scientific method even though specific findings were wrong.

---

## 2. ENRICO FERRI (1856-1929)

**Title:** "Father of Positive School"

**Book:** "Criminal Sociology" (1884)

---

### Theory: Multiple Factors

**Main Idea:** Crime caused by THREE types of factors working together, not just biology alone.

---

### Three Causes (3)

**1. Anthropological (Individual):**
- Biological (age, sex, heredity) and Psychological (intelligence, temperament) - individual characteristics of person matter.

**2. Physical (Natural Environment):**
- Climate, temperature, seasons, geography - example: violent crimes increase in hot summer weather.

**3. Social (Social Environment):**
- Poverty, unemployment, education, family, urbanization, political system - society's conditions shape criminal behavior significantly.

---

### Classification (5)

**1. Born Criminals:** Biological tendency - difficult to reform.

**2. Insane Criminals:** Mental illness causes - need treatment.

**3. Habitual Criminals:** Environment made them criminal - can be reformed through environmental change.

**4. Occasional Criminals:** By chance or opportunity - easily reformed.

**5. Passionate Criminals:** Emotion-driven - usually don't repeat.

---

### Key Concepts

**Law of Criminal Saturation:**
- Every society has certain crime level determined by conditions - like salt dissolving in water, crime "saturates" at level determined by social, physical, anthropological factors.

**Penal Substitutes:**
- Instead of punishment, use social measures - free trade, cheap housing, street lighting, education reform, tax changes address root causes.

**Contribution:** Broadened criminology from pure biology to include social factors - multiple causation model used today.

---

## 3. RAFFAELE GAROFALO (1852-1934)

**Profession:** Italian jurist and criminologist

**Book:** "Criminologia" (1885)

---

### Theory: Natural Crime

**Main Idea:** Distinction between natural crime (universal) and legal crime (varies by place and time).

**Two Moral Sentiments:**
- **Probity:** Respect for property rights - violation creates property crimes.
- **Pity:** Compassion for human life - violation creates violent crimes.

**Natural Crime:** Acts violating these sentiments like murder and robbery - wrong everywhere and always.

**Legal Crime:** Acts violating specific laws like tax evasion - varies by country and era.

---

### Classification (4)

**1. Murderers:** Completely lack pity - eliminate through death penalty for societal protection.

**2. Violent Criminals:** Deficient in pity - life imprisonment or transportation to isolate from society.

**3. Property Criminals:** Lack probity - transportation and forced labor as punishment.

**4. Sex Offenders:** Morally deficient - treatment varies by severity of offense.

**Note:** Garofalo harshest of three - favored elimination of incurable dangerous criminals.

---

### Contribution

- Provided legal and moral framework to Positivist School - concept of universal crimes influenced international criminal law development.

---

## COMPARISON

| Aspect | Lombroso | Ferri | Garofalo |
|--------|----------|-------|----------|
| Focus | Biology, physical traits | Multiple factors combined | Law and morality |
| Cause | Born criminal with atavism | Bio + Social + Physical | Moral deficiency |
| Treatment | Identify and control | Social reform prevents | Eliminate dangerous |
| Approach | Anthropological | Sociological | Jurisprudential |

**Progress:** Lombroso started biology → Ferri added society → Garofalo added law.

---

## CONCLUSION

The triumvirate established scientific criminology as alternative to Classical School. Lombroso's biological determinism proved flawed but introduced scientific method. Ferri's multiple causation (bio-psycho-social) remains foundational today. Garofalo's natural crime concept provided philosophical basis for universal criminal justice. Together they shifted justice from retribution to treatment, free will to determinism, punishment to prevention. Modern criminology retains scientific methodology and multi-causal approach while rejecting strict biological determinism and harsh elimination policies.
