## INTRODUCTION

Sykes and Matza (1957) observed most delinquents feel guilt and drift in/out of crime. They use "neutralization techniques" to overcome guilt BEFORE committing crimes.

---

## KEY OBSERVATIONS (3)

1. Delinquents feel guilty (not rejecting values completely)
2. Admire law-abiding persons (don't want family victimized)
3. Delinquency is episodic (not always criminal, most age out)

**Conclusion:** NOT fully committed to deviant values

---

## CONCEPT OF DRIFT

**Definition:** Movement between conventional and criminal behavior

**Metaphor:** Like drifting on raft between two shores
- Not committed to crime
- Not committed to convention
- Move between both

**Implication:** Youth can drift IN and OUT of crime

## FIVE TECHNIQUES OF NEUTRALIZATION (3D-CA)

> Rationalizations used BEFORE crime to overcome guilt

---

### **1. DENIAL OF RESPONSIBILITY**
- "It wasn't my fault"
- Blame external forces
- Examples: "I was drunk," "Friends made me"

### **2. DENIAL OF INJURY**
- "Nobody really hurt"
- Minimize harm
- Examples: "Store has insurance," "He's rich"

### **3. DENIAL OF VICTIM**
- "They deserved it"
- Victim becomes wrongdoer
- Examples: "He insulted me," "Rich exploit poor"

### **4. CONDEMNATION OF CONDEMNERS**
- "Everyone corrupt, who are they to judge?"
- Attack accusers
- Examples: "Police take bribes," "Politicians steal"

### **5. APPEAL TO HIGHER LOYALTIES**
- "Had to do it for gang/family"
- Loyalty to smaller group
- Examples: "Gang needed me," "Family first"

## HOW NEUTRALIZATION WORKS

```
Want to commit crime → Feel guilt → Use neutralization → Guilt overcome → Commit crime
```

**Key:** Used BEFORE crime to enable it, not just after as excuse

---

## POLICY IMPLICATIONS (4)

1. **Challenge rationalizations** - Show logical flaws
2. **Strengthen values** - Moral education
3. **Victim awareness** - Meet real victims
4. **Accountability** - Take responsibility, no excuses

---

## CONCLUSION

Neutralization techniques allow individuals to temporarily overcome guilt and commit crimes while maintaining self-image as good person. Five techniques—denial of responsibility, injury, and victim, condemnation of condemners, appeal to loyalties—enable crime by releasing moral constraints. Drift concept explains episodic nature of youth crime. Understanding these allows interventions challenging rationalizations and strengthening accountability.
