---

## FACTORS IN PROFILING (3)

**1. Crime Scene**
- Weapon used, force level
- Body positioning, items taken
- Planning level

**2. Victimology**
- Who was targeted and why
- Victim's lifestyle
- High-risk vs low-risk victim

**3. MO vs Signature**
- **MO:** Method (can change), functional
- **Signature:** Psychological need (doesn't change), unique

## MERITS (7)

**1. Narrows Suspects**
- Reduces number to investigate
- Saves time and resources

**2. Guides Investigation**
- Prioritizes leads
- Determines strategies

**3. Links Cases**
- Identifies serial crimes
- Connects across jurisdictions

**4. Generates Leads**
- Predicts where offender might be
- Anticipates next moves

**5. Courtroom Use**
- Expert testimony
- Risk assessment

**6. Prevention**
- Identifies potential targets
- Warns potential victims

**7. Interview Strategies**
- Tailors interrogation approach
- Elicits confessions better

---

## DEMERITS (8)

**1. Lack Scientific Rigor**
- Often based on intuition, not research
- More "art" than "science"

**2. Inaccuracy**
- Can be vague or wrong
- May fit many people
- High false positive rate

**3. Confirmation Bias**
- Police focus only on matching suspects
- Ignore contradictory evidence
- Real offender may be missed

**4. Limited Use**

- Needs highly trained experts
- Expensive
- Time-consuming

**6. Ethical Issues**

## ORGANIZED VS DISORGANIZED (FBI)

| Feature | Organized | Disorganized |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| IQ | Above average | Below average |
| Planning | Planned | Spontaneous |
| Scene | Controlled | Chaotic |
| Victim | Targeted | Opportunity |
| Evidence | Minimal | Extensive |
| Social | Good skills | Loner |

## CONCLUSION

Criminal profiling offers valuable investigative tool despite limitations. Seven merits including narrowing suspects and guiding investigation demonstrate utility for serial crimes. However, eight demerits including lack of rigor, inaccuracy, and ethical concerns require cautious use. When used by trained professionals as one tool among many (not sole basis), profiling can enhance investigations. Future should focus on increasing scientific validation and standardizing methods.
