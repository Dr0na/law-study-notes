## DURKHEIM'S ANOMIE (1897)

**Definition:** Anomie = Normlessness; breakdown of social norms

**When It Happens:**
- Rapid social change
- Economic boom or bust
- Social upheaval
- Weak institutions

**Effect:** People unclear about rules → Deviance increases

---

## MERTON'S STRAIN THEORY (1938)

**Merton's Modification:**
- Adapted anomie for modern society
- Made it specific to goals-means gap
- Structural inequality focus

---

### Two Components

**1. Cultural Goals:**
- Society tells EVERYONE to be successful
- Financial success emphasized

**2. Institutional Means:**
- Legitimate ways to succeed
- Education, hard work
- NOT equally available

**Problem:** Goals for all, means for few → STRAIN

---

### Five Modes

2. **Innovation** (✅❌) - **CRIME**

4. **Retreatism** (❌❌) - Withdraw
5. **Rebellion** (🔄🔄) - Change system

## MODERN EXTENSIONS

**Institutional Anomie (Messner & Rosenfeld, 1994):**
- Economy dominates all institutions
- Weakens family, education, religion

**General Strain (Agnew, 1992):**
- Broadened beyond economic goals
- Three types of strain
- Individual focus

---

## CONCLUSION

Both theories explain crime as result of social structural problems. Durkheim focused on norm breakdown during change; Merton specified goals-means gap in modern society. Together they show crime is social product requiring social solutions—addressing structural conditions, not just punishing individuals.
