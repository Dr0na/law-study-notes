## SCOPE OF CRIMINOLOGY (6)

**1. Nature of Crime:**
- Definition, classification, types of crimes - statistics, trends, patterns, measurement methods used by agencies.

**2. Causes of Crime:**
- Individual factors: Biology (genes, brain), Psychology (personality, mental illness), Cognition (decision-making, reasoning)
- Social factors: Poverty, education, family structure, peer influence, subcultural factors affecting behavior
- Environmental factors: Neighborhood characteristics, social disorganization, opportunity structures for crime

**3. Criminal Behavior:**
- Why people commit crimes examining motivation, how criminal behavior develops over time and life course, patterns of offending including specialization, why people stop (desistance from crime)

**4. Criminal Justice System:**
- Police (law enforcement, investigation, arrest, community policing strategies)
- Courts (prosecution, trial, adjudication, sentencing decisions)
- Corrections (prisons, probation, parole, rehabilitation programs, community supervision)
- Analysis of system effectiveness, fairness, and needed reforms

**5. Crime Prevention:**
- Primary prevention before crime occurs targeting general population
- Secondary prevention through early intervention with at-risk individuals
- Tertiary prevention via rehabilitation of convicted offenders
- Evidence-based strategies and community programs

**6. Victimology:**
- Impact of crime on victims (physical, psychological, financial effects)
- Victim-offender relationship patterns and dynamics
- Victim rights, services, compensation programs
- Prevention of secondary victimization by system

## OBJECTIVES OF CRIMINOLOGY (5)

**1. Understanding Crime:**
- Analyze nature and extent accurately, study patterns and distributions, document societal impact systematically.

**2. Identifying Causes:**
- Determine factors leading to crime at individual, social, environmental levels - develop and test causal theories scientifically.

**3. Preventing Crime:**
- Develop evidence-based prevention strategies, implement effective policies and programs, address root causes identified through research.

**4. Reforming Criminals:**
- Rehabilitation and reintegration into society, reduce recidivism rates significantly, develop effective treatment addressing criminogenic needs.

**5. Protecting Society:**
- Ensure public safety and social order, balance punishment with rehabilitation appropriately, develop fair and effective justice system.

## INTERDISCIPLINARY NATURE (7)

| Science | Contribution to Criminology |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Psychology | Criminal mind, behavior, motivation, personality, mental illness understanding |
| Sociology | Social factors, group behavior, structures, institutions, cultural influences |
| Psychiatry | Mental illness-crime link, treatment of offenders, forensic assessment |
| Law | Legal framework, procedures, rights, due process requirements |
| Economics | Poverty-crime connection, cost-benefit analysis, economic theories |
| Biology | Genetics, brain function, hormones, evolutionary psychology perspectives |
| Anthropology | Cultural influences, cross-cultural crime patterns, traditional justice systems |

**Criminology draws from all these** to provide holistic understanding impossible with single discipline alone.

---

## CONCLUSION

Criminology as scientific interdisciplinary study encompasses six-part scope (nature, causes, behavior, justice system, prevention, victims) guided by five objectives (understanding, identifying causes, preventing, reforming, protecting). Drawing from psychology, sociology, law, biology, and other sciences enables comprehensive approach to complex crime phenomenon. Scientific methodology ensures policies based on evidence rather than mere intuition or tradition, leading to more effective and humane criminal justice responses.
