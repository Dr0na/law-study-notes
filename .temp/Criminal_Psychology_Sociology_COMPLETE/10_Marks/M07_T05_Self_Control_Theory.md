## SELF-CONTROL THEORY (Gottfredson & Hirschi, 1990)

**Main Idea:** Low self-control is single best predictor of crime

---

### What is Self-Control?

Ability to:
- Delay gratification
- Consider consequences
- Resist temptation
- Control impulses

---

### Characteristics of Low Self-Control (6)

1. **Impulsivity** - Act without thinking
2. **Simple tasks** - Avoid complex, want easy
3. **Risk-seeking** - Thrill-seeking, reckless
4. **Physical over mental** - Action over thought
5. **Self-centered** - No empathy
6. **Temper** - Quick to anger, low frustration tolerance

---

### Origin

**Developed in childhood (before age 10):**

**Good Parenting → High Self-Control:**
- Monitor child
- Recognize bad behavior
- Punish consistently
- Care about child

**Poor Parenting → Low Self-Control:**
- Don't monitor
- Don't recognize problems
- Don't punish or punish erratically
- Don't care (neglect)

---

### Why Low Self-Control Leads to Crime

Crime perfect for person with low self-control:
- Immediate gratification
- Little effort required
- Exciting and risky
- Few long-term benefits

**Also leads to:** Poor grades, unemployment, substance abuse, accidents

---

### Key Claims

1. **Established by age 10** - Remains stable throughout life
2. **General theory** - Explains crime AND other problems (drinking, smoking, accidents)

---

## SELF-ESTEEM AND CRIME

**Two Competing Ideas:**
- **Low self-esteem → Crime:** Feel inferior, crime compensates
- **High self-esteem → Crime:** Inflated ego, violence when challenged

**Research:** Mixed results, relationship is complex

**Threatened Egotism:** Violence occurs when high self-esteem is threatened

---

## COMPARISON

| Concept | Relation to Crime |
|---------|------------------|
| Self-Control | Low SC → High crime (STRONG support) |
| Self-Esteem | Complex, mixed findings |

**Conclusion:** Self-control much better predictor

---

## POLICY IMPLICATIONS (4)

1. **Early intervention** - Before age 10
2. **Parent training** - Teach effective parenting
3. **School programs** - Self-control training
4. **Recognize limits** - Criminal justice too late, focus on prevention

---

## CRITICISM

- Circular reasoning ("Why crime?" "Low self-control")
- Self-control CAN change (not as stable as claimed)
- Ignores opportunity and situation
- Too simplistic (one cause for all crime?)

---

## CONCLUSION

Self-Control Theory posits low self-control from poor parenting causes crime because criminal behavior provides immediate gratification. Policy focuses on early childhood intervention and parenting education. While facing criticisms, emphasis on early formation has influenced prevention programs targeting at-risk families before criminal patterns establish.
