## INTRODUCTION

Gabriel Tarde (1843-1904), French sociologist, opposed Lombroso arguing crime is LEARNED through IMITATION, not inherited biologically.

## THREE LAWS OF IMITATION

---

### **LAW 1: LAW OF CLOSE CONTACT**

**Statement:** Imitation occurs between people in close physical and social contact.

**Explanation:**
- People imitate those geographically and socially CLOSE to them - family, friends, neighbors have strongest influence over behavior.

**Application to Crime (5):**
- Children imitate criminal parents' behavior patterns
- Juveniles imitate gang members they associate with daily
- Crime spreads in neighborhoods through close contact
- Prisons become "schools of crime" where inmates learn from each other
- Organized crime transmits techniques through close apprenticeship relationships

---

### **LAW 2: IMITATION OF SUPERIORS BY INFERIORS**

**Statement:** Lower class imitates upper class, subordinates imitate leaders.

**Explanation:**
- Inferiors copy superiors who have prestige and status - young imitate old, poor imitate rich, less educated imitate more educated.

**Application to Crime (5):**
- Lower class imitates white-collar financial frauds of upper class
- Subordinates copy corrupt behavior of leaders in organizations
- Desire for upper-class lifestyle leads to theft when unaffordable
- Political corruption spreads downward through government hierarchy
- Media portrayal of successful criminals inspires imitation behavior

---

### **LAW 3: LAW OF INSERTION (SUBSTITUTION)**

**Statement:** New behavioral patterns replace old patterns when they come into contact.

**Explanation:**
- More effective methods win over traditional ones - innovation and modernization occur naturally through replacement.

**Application to Crime (5):**
- Cybercrime replaces traditional property crime methods
- Identity theft replaces physical theft of documents
- Modern sophisticated burglary techniques replace crude old methods
- New synthetic drugs replace traditional narcotics in markets
- Technology constantly changes criminal methods and opportunities

## TARDE VS LOMBROSO

| Aspect | Lombroso (Biological) | Tarde (Social) |
|--------|----------------------|---------------|
| Cause | Biological heredity | Social imitation and learning |
| Criminal | Born criminal | Made criminal through learning |
| Focus | Individual biology | Social environment and interaction |
| Solution | Identify and eliminate | Change social conditions |
| Reform | Impossible for born criminals | Possible through education |

---

## MODERN RELEVANCE

**Legacy:**
- Foundation for Sutherland's Differential Association Theory (1939)
- Basis for all modern social learning theories of crime
- Influenced Akers, Bandura, and contemporary criminologists

**Policy Implications:**
- Separate criminals to prevent imitation and learning
- Provide positive prosocial role models for youth
- Media responsibility avoiding glamorization and detailed coverage
- Early intervention preventing criminal behavior learning

---

## CONCLUSION

Tarde's Laws show crime spreads through imitation: people imitate those close to them (Law 1), inferiors imitate superiors (Law 2), new methods replace old ones (Law 3). By proving crime is socially learned through imitation, not biologically inherited, Tarde challenged Lombroso's determinism and laid foundation for modern social learning theories. His emphasis on imitation remains highly relevant today for understanding copycat crimes, gang behavior dynamics, cybercrime evolution, and media influence on criminal conduct patterns.
