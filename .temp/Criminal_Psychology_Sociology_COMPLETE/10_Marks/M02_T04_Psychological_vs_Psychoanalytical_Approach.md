## INTRODUCTION

Criminal psychology uses two main approaches: psychoanalytical (focuses on unconscious mind) and psychological (focuses on observable behavior).

---

## PSYCHOANALYTICAL APPROACH

**Founded by:** Sigmund Freud

**Focus:** Unconscious mind and childhood experiences

### Freud's Personality (3)

**ID:**
- Primitive drives (food, sex, sleep)
- Pleasure principle: "I want now!"
- Unconscious, impulsive

**EGO:**
- Reality principle: "Be practical"
- Mediator between Id and reality
- Rational

**SUPEREGO:**
- Moral conscience
- Morality principle: "That's wrong!"
- Creates guilt

### Crime from Imbalance
- Overdeveloped Id → Impulsive crimes
- Underdeveloped Superego → No guilt (psychopathy)
- Overdeveloped Superego → Crime for self-punishment

---

## PSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACH

**Focus:** Observable behavior

**Characteristics:**
- Scientific experiments and tests
- Studies measurable behavior
- Learning and conditioning emphasized
- Current behavior, less focus on childhood

---

## COMPARISON

| Aspect | Psychoanalytical | Psychological |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Focus** | Unconscious mind | Observable behavior |
| **Method** | Case studies, therapy | Experiments, tests |
| **Key Concept** | Id-Ego-Superego | Learning, conditioning |
| **Cause** | Personality conflict | Learned behavior |
| **Childhood** | Crucial | Important but not sole |
| **Treatment** | Psychotherapy | Behavior modification |
| **Testability** | Difficult | Easier |

---

## APPLICATIONS

**Psychoanalytical:**
- Deep personality understanding
- Long-term therapy
- Unconscious motivations

**Psychological:**
- Behavior modification programs
- Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)
- Measurable, time-limited interventions
- Prison programs

## CONCLUSION

Psychoanalytical approach offers deep understanding through unconscious and childhood, while psychological approach provides scientific, testable methods. Modern forensic psychology integrates both—using scientific methods while recognizing personality dynamics. Both contribute valuable insights for comprehensive assessment and treatment of offenders.
