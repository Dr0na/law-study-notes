**2. INSTRUMENTAL/PROACTIVE**
- Planned, calculated
- Unemotional
- Goal: OBTAIN something (harm is means)
- Example: Armed robbery for money

## THEORIES OF AGGRESSION (3)

**1. INSTINCT THEORY (Freud)**
- Aggression is innate instinct
- Death instinct ("Thanatos")
- Must be expressed

**2. FRUSTRATION-AGGRESSION (Dollard)**
- Frustration always leads to aggression
- Blocked goals → Frustration → Aggression
- Example: Poverty → Frustration → Crime

**3. SOCIAL LEARNING (Bandura)**
- Aggression is LEARNED, not innate
- Through observation and reinforcement
- **Bobo Doll experiment** proved it
- Children imitate violent models

**Modern View:** Social learning most supported

## FACTORS IN AGGRESSION

**Biological (3):**
1. **Brain:** Amygdala (emotion), prefrontal cortex (control), hypothalamus
2. **Neurotransmitters:** Low serotonin → More aggression, High testosterone → More aggression
3. **Genetics:** Inherited component exists

**Environmental (4):**
1. **Family:** Child abuse, witnessing violence
2. **Peers:** Gang membership, peer pressure
3. **Media:** Violent TV, movies, games

## PREVENTION (4 Levels)

**Individual:** Anger management, therapy  
**Family:** Parenting education, counseling  
**Community:** Youth programs, mentorship  
**Society:** Gun control, alcohol regulation

## CONCLUSION

Aggression has biological (brain, hormones), psychological (frustration, learning), and environmental (family, peers, media) causes. Theories range from Freud's instinct to Bandura's social learning. Two types—hostile (emotional) and instrumental (calculated)—explain different violent crimes. Modern emphasis on learned nature suggests prevention possible through education, positive modeling, and addressing environmental risk factors.
