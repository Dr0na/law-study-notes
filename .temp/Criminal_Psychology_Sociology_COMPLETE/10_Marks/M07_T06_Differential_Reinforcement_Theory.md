## INTRODUCTION

Akers and Burgess (1966) modernized Sutherland's theory by adding operant conditioning (B.F. Skinner). They combined sociology with behavioral psychology.

**Main Idea:** Criminal behavior shaped by its consequences (rewards and punishments)

---

## KEY PRINCIPLES (4)

**1. Differential Association** (from Sutherland)
- Association with criminal vs non-criminal persons
- Learn definitions
- In intimate groups

**2. Definitions** (from Sutherland)
- Favorable or unfavorable to crime
- Learned from associates

**3. Differential Reinforcement** (NEW)
> Behavior strengthened or weakened by consequences

**4. Imitation** (NEW - from Bandura)
- Observe and model others
- Especially if they're rewarded

---

## TYPES OF CONSEQUENCES (4)

**1. Positive Reinforcement**
- Behavior + Reward → Repeat
- Examples: Theft → Money → Repeat theft

**2. Negative Reinforcement**
- Behavior removes something bad → Repeat
- Examples: Crime → Escape poverty → Repeat

**3. Punishment**
- Behavior + Bad consequence → Stop
- Examples: Crime → Arrested → Less likely

**4. Extinction**
- Behavior + No reward → Stop
- Examples: Shoplifting → Always caught → Give up

---

## THE PROCESS

```
Person → Associates (learn definitions) → Tries behavior → If REWARDED → REPEAT | If PUNISHED → STOP → Pattern develops
```

---

## BALANCE OF REINFORCEMENTS

**Person continues crime when:**
> Rewards > Costs

**Rewards:** Money, status, excitement, peer approval  
**Costs:** Risk of arrest, punishment, guilt, family disappointment

---

## ADVANTAGES OVER SUTHERLAND (4)

1. **More specific** - Clear mechanisms
2. **More testable** - Can measure rewards/punishments
3. **Explains continuation** - Why keep or stop offending
4. **Treatment applications** - Behavior modification programs

---

## POLICY IMPLICATIONS (4)

1. **Increase costs** - Certain punishment
2. **Decrease rewards** - Seize proceeds
3. **Increase legitimate rewards** - Jobs, recognition
4. **CBT programs** - Change thinking and behavior

---

## CONCLUSION

Differential Reinforcement enhanced Sutherland's theory by adding operant conditioning—behavior shaped by consequences. Rewards increase crime, punishments decrease it. More specific and testable than Sutherland, providing practical framework for interventions changing reinforcement patterns. Modern behavior modification programs and CBT reflect this theory's influence.
