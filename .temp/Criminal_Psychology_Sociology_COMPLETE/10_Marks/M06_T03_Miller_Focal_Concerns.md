## INTRODUCTION

Walter Miller (1958) argued lower-class culture is distinct and independent, not reactive. Gang delinquency is normal expression of lower-class values (focal concerns).

**Key Difference from Cohen:** NOT reacting to middle class; FOLLOWING their own culture

---

## SIX FOCAL CONCERNS (T-T-S-E-F-A)

**Focal Concerns = Values most important to lower-class culture**

---

### **1. TROUBLE**
- Getting into and out of trouble is major concern
- **Ambivalence:** Trouble brings status BUT also punishment
- **Crime link:** Fighting, drinking bring respect

---

### **2. TOUGHNESS**
- Physical prowess, masculinity highly valued
- Prove "real man" status
- **Why:** Often no male role models (female-headed homes)
- **Crime link:** Fighting to show toughness, cannot back down from challenges

---

### **3. SMARTNESS**
- "Street smarts" - ability to outsmart others
- Cunning, conning, hustling
- NOT academic intelligence
- **Crime link:** Fraud, hustling, outwitting police brings status

---

### **4. EXCITEMENT**
- Seeking thrills, avoiding boredom
- Gambling, drinking, fast driving
- Life otherwise monotonous
- **Crime link:** Joyriding, crimes for thrill

---

### **5. FATE**
- Life controlled by fate/luck, not effort
- "What will be, will be"
- Cannot control destiny
- **Crime link:** Don't worry about consequences, "If caught, it's fate"

---

### **6. AUTONOMY**
- Desire freedom from authority
- "Nobody tells me what to do"
- Resentment of control
- **Crime link:** Defying authority, breaking rules to assert independence

---

## GANG DELINQUENCY EXPLAINED

**Miller's Argument:**
- Boys CONFORMING to lower-class culture
- Expressing focal concerns naturally
- NOT reacting to middle class
- Behavior defined as "delinquent" by middle class, but normal for them

**Process:**
1. Grow up learning focal concerns
2. Form peer groups (gangs)
3. Act according to values (fighting, hustling, excitement)
4. Middle class calls it "crime"

---

## POLICY IMPLICATIONS (4)

1. **Accept cultural differences** - Don't try to change their culture
2. **Provide legal outlets** - Sports for toughness, business for smartness
3. **Realistic expectations** - Don't expect middle-class values
4. **Economic opportunities** - Jobs valuing practical skills

---

## CONCLUSION

Miller's six focal concerns—trouble, toughness, smartness, excitement, fate, autonomy—characterize distinct lower-class culture. Gang delinquency is normal expression of these values, not pathological reaction to status frustration. Understanding this requires policy respecting cultural identity while providing legitimate outlets for valued behaviors rather than imposing middle-class standards.
