├─────────────────────────────────────┤

│       • Intention present           │
│       • Precede the act             │
│                                     │

├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ What? AGREEMENT between 2+ persons  │
│                                     │
│ 4 Elements (A-T-I-O):               │
│ • AGREEMENT (express/implied)       │
│ • TWO+ persons                      │
│ • INTENTION (common)                │
│ • OVERT act (sometimes)             │
│                                     │
│ Example: A, B, C agree to commit    │
│ robbery & plan together → All 3     │
│ abetted by CONSPIRACY even before   │
│ robbery                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Remember: **A-T-I-O**

## 🔥 High-Yield Facts (Must Remember)

### Count Facts:
✔ **3** Forms of Abetment
✔ **4** Elements of Conspiracy (A-T-I-O)
✔ **5** Requirements of Intentional Aid (P-I-F-T-K)
✔ **6** Liability Situations (G-N-P-D-I-M)
✔ Sections **45-60** BNS

### Critical Illustrations:
✔ Instigation: A tells B that C wronged him → B attacks
✔ Conspiracy: A, B, C agree to rob → All abettors
✔ Aid: A supplies poison to B → B kills C with it
✔ Not Done: A instigates B → B refuses → A still liable
✔ Probable: A instigates robbery → B murders during → A liable if foreseeable
✔ Innocent Agent: A gives poison to child → Child gives to victim → A principal

### Key Distinctions:
✔ Instigation ≠ Advice (must be active)
✔ Conspiracy to Abet ≠ Criminal Conspiracy (Section 61)
✔ Mere presence ≠ Intentional aid (must be active help)
✔ Abetment ≠ Attempt (helps another vs tries oneself)
