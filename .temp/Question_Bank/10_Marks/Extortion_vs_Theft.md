### **DISTINCTION BETWEEN EXTORTION AND THEFT**

#### **Introduction**

Extortion and Theft are two important offenses against property under the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023. While both involve taking another person's property dishonestly, they differ fundamentally in the **manner of taking**. Theft involves taking property **without consent**, while extortion involves taking property **with consent obtained through threat or intimidation**. Theft is defined under **Section 303 BNS** (previously Section 378 IPC), while Extortion is defined under **Section 308 BNS** (previously Section 383 IPC).

### **I. THEFT (Section 303 BNS)**

#### **Definition**

**"Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of any person without that person's consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit theft."**

#### **5 Essential Ingredients of Theft**

**1️⃣ Dishonest Intention**

**Requirement**: Must be **dishonest intention** to take property

**Dishonestly** (Section 23 BNS): Doing anything with intention of causing wrongful gain to one person or wrongful loss to another.

**Test**: Did accused intend to cause wrongful gain/loss?

**Example**: Taking property knowing one has no right to it.

**2️⃣ Movable Property**

**Requirement**: Property must be **movable**

**Movable Property** includes:
- Corporeal property (tangible - car, jewelry, money)

**NOT Theft**:
- ❌ Immovable property (land, buildings)
- ❌ Services
- ❌ Intangible rights (unless deemed property)

**Examples**:
- ✅ Stealing car, laptop, jewelry → Theft
- ❌ Occupying someone's land → Not theft (different offense)

---

**3️⃣ Taking Out of Possession**

**Requirement**: Taking property **out of possession** of another person

**Possession** means:
- Physical custody OR
- Legal control over property

**Key Point**: Must take from someone's possession

**Example**:
- Taking money from person's wallet = Theft
- Taking abandoned property = Not theft (no possession)

---

**4️⃣ Without Consent**

**Requirement**: Taking must be **without consent** of possessor

**Critical Element**: Absence of consent

**Distinctions**:
- No consent = Theft
- Consent obtained by deception = Cheating (not theft)
- Consent obtained by threat = Extortion (not theft)

**Example**:
- Secretly taking property = Without consent → Theft
- Taking with permission = Not theft

---

**5️⃣ Moving the Property**

**Requirement**: Accused must **move** the property in order to take it

**"Moving"**: Any motion or change of position

**Key Point**: Even slightest movement sufficient

**Examples**:
- ✅ Lifting article from shelf → Movement
- ✅ Pushing car few inches → Movement
- ❌ Merely touching without moving → Not theft

**Illustration**: A cuts down tree on B's land intending to dishonestly take it. Tree falls. Not yet theft until A moves it away.

### **II. EXTORTION (Section 308 BNS)**

#### **Definition**

### **III. DISTINCTION: Extortion vs Theft**

| **Aspect** | **THEFT** | **EXTORTION** |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| **Section** | Section 303 BNS | Section 308 BNS |
| **Consent** | ❌ **Without consent** | ✅ With consent (vitiated by fear) |
| **How Taken** | **Secretly** or **without knowledge** | By **threat/intimidation** |
| **Property** | Only **movable** property | Movable OR **immovable** property |
| **Presence** | Victim may be absent | Victim usually **present** |

---

### **IV. DISTINCTION: Robbery vs Dacoity**

### **V. KEY CASE LAWS**

**Shri Ram v. State of U.P.** (1975):
- Theft requires taking without consent
- Extortion requires consent obtained by putting in fear
- Held: Clear distinction based on consent element

**Jhandu Lal v. State of Punjab** (1974):
- For robbery, force must be voluntary
- Must be used to commit theft or overcome resistance
- Held: Force is essential distinguishing element

---

### **Conclusion**

The distinction between extortion and theft lies fundamentally in the **presence or absence of consent**. In **theft**, property is taken **without the owner's consent** - stealthily or secretly. In **extortion**, property is obtained **with consent**, but that consent is **vitiated by fear** induced through threats or intimidation. 

Further, **theft** is limited to **movable property** only, while **extortion** can involve both movable and immovable property. When theft or extortion is accompanied by **force or threat of instant harm**, it becomes **robbery**, and when robbery is committed by **five or more persons** acting conjointly, it becomes **dacoity**. 

Understanding these distinctions is crucial as they determine the appropriate charge and punishment, ranging from 3 years for simple theft/extortion to life imprisonment for dacoity, reflecting the escalating threat to person and property.
