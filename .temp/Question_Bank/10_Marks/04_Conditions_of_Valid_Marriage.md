### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Sapinda relationship is a crucial concept under Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, governing marriage prohibitions based on degrees of blood relationship. Defined under Section 3(f) and made a condition for valid marriage under Section 5(iv), sapinda relationship prevents marriages between persons related within certain degrees, thereby safeguarding against consanguineous marriages.

---

### **DEFINITION [Section 3(f)]**

Section 3(f) of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 defines sapinda relationship as follows:

"Two persons are said to be 'sapindas' of each other if one is a lineal ascendant of the other within the limits of sapinda relationship, or if they have a common lineal ascendant who is within the limits of sapinda relationship with reference to each of them."

**Limits Specified:**
- **3 degrees** through father (excluding first generation)
- **5 degrees** through mother (excluding first generation)

---

### **MEANING AND ORIGIN**

**Etymology:**
"Sapinda" is Sanskrit word meaning:
- "Sa" = same/common
- "Pinda" = body/particles
- Literally: "Connected by particles of same body"

**Religious Significance:**
- In Hindu tradition, pinda (rice balls) offered during funeral ceremonies (shraddha)
- Persons offering pinda to same ancestor are sapindas
- Traditionally determined funeral rite participation

---

### **HOW TO CALCULATE SAPINDA DEGREES**

**Rule of Calculation:**
1. **Exclude first generation** (self and immediate parent)
2. **Count upward** to ascertain degrees

---

### **CALCULATION THROUGH FATHER'S LINE (3 Degrees)**

**Step-by-Step:**

```
Self (A)
↓
Father (EXCLUDED - First Generation)
↓
Grandfather (1st Degree)
↓
Great-grandfather (2nd Degree)
↓
Great-great-grandfather (3rd Degree)
```

**Within 3 Degrees Through Father:**
- A and Grandfather = Sapindas (1 degree)
- A and Great-grandfather = Sapindas (2 degrees)
- A and Great-great-grandfather = Sapindas (3 degrees)
- A and Great-great-great-grandfather = NOT sapindas (exceeds 3 degrees)

---

### **CALCULATION THROUGH MOTHER'S LINE (5 Degrees)**

**Step-by-Step:**

```
Self (A)
↓
Mother (EXCLUDED - First Generation)
↓
Maternal Grandfather (1st Degree)
↓
Mat. Great-grandfather (2nd Degree)
↓
Mat. GG-grandfather (3rd Degree)
↓
Mat. GGG-grandfather (4th Degree)
↓
Mat. GGGG-grandfather (5th Degree)
```

**Within 5 Degrees Through Mother:**
- A and Maternal Grandfather = Sapindas (1 degree)
- A and up to 5th degree ancestor = Sapindas
- Beyond 5 degrees = NOT sapindas

---

### **PRACTICAL EXAMPLES**

**Example 1:**
Can A (male) marry his father's sister (paternal aunt)?

**Calculation:**
```
A → Father (excluded) → Grandfather (1) → Grandfather's children include father and aunt
```
Father's sister is within 3 degrees through father = **Sapinda relationship**
**Answer:** NO, unless custom permits.

**Example 2:**
Can A marry his mother's mother (maternal grandmother)?

**Calculation:**
```
A → Mother (excluded) → Maternal Grandmother (1)
```
Within 5 degrees through mother = **Sapinda relationship**
**Answer:** NO, unless custom permits.

**Example 3:**
Can A marry his cousin (father's brother's daughter)?

**Calculation:**
```
A → Father (excluded) → Grandfather (1) → Uncle → Cousin
```
Within 3 degrees = **Sapinda relationship**
**Answer:** NO, unless custom permits.

---

### **PROHIBITION UNDER SECTION 5(iv)**

**Statutory Provision:**
"The parties are not sapindas of each other, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two"

**Effect:**
Marriage between sapindas is **VOID** under Section 11.

---

### **EXCEPTION - CUSTOM**

**Custom May Permit:**

In certain communities, marriages within sapinda relationship are permitted by custom.

**Example: South Indian Custom**
- Cross-cousin marriages (mother's brother's daughter)
- Traditionally acceptable
- Custom must be proved

**Requirements for Valid Custom:**
- Must be ancient, certain, reasonable
- Continuous and uniform observance
- Must apply to both parties
- Burden of proof on party claiming custom

**Case Law:**
**Veerappa Setty v. Veeramma (AIR 1955 Mad 291):**
Custom permitting sapinda marriage must be strictly proved.

---

### **WHY 3 AND 5 DEGREES?**

**Historical Rationale:**

**Father's Line (3 Degrees):**
- Agnatic (male line) succession important
- 3 generations sufficient for property purposes
- Religious rituals performed up to 3 generations

**Mother's Line (5 Degrees):**
- Maternal relationship given wider recognition
- Acknowledges maternal ancestry importance
- Extended family includes maternal relations more broadly

**Genetic Rationale:**
Sufficient genetic distance to minimize risk of genetic disorders.

---

### **CASE LAWS**

**Madhavrao v. Raghavendrarao (AIR 1946 SC 33):**
- Sapinda relationship calculated strictly per Section 3(f)
- Marriage within prohibited sapinda degrees is void
- No relaxation without valid custom

---

#### **CONCLUSION**

Sapinda relationship under Hindu Marriage Act represents an important prohibition based on degrees of blood relationship. The 3-degree rule through father and 5-degree rule through mother, calculated by excluding the first generation, creates a clear mathematical formula for determining prohibited marriages. This concept, rooted in Hindu religious tradition of pinda offerings, serves modern purposes of preventing consanguineous marriages and genetic disorders while maintaining family and social order. The exception for custom acknowledges regional diversity, particularly South Indian cross-cousin marriage traditions, while requiring strict proof to prevent abuse. Understanding sapinda calculation is essential for determining validity of Hindu marriages.

- Reduced maternal mortality

---

#### **CONCLUSION**

The age requirement under Section 5(iii) of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 serves as crucial safeguard against child marriages, ensuring that parties possess maturity necessary for informed consent and marital responsibilities. The voidable nature of underage marriages, with 2-year window for annulment, balances protection of minors with stability of marriages ratified by continued cohabitation after attaining majority.

The dual regime under HMA and Prohibition of Child Marriage Act provides both civil remedy (annulment) and criminal deterrence (prosecution), reflecting society's strong commitment to ending child marriages. Section 16's protection of children's legitimacy demonstrates humane approach of protecting innocent offspring.

As India moves toward gender parity in marriage age and stricter enforcement through registration requirements and prohibition officers, the age requirement provisions continue to evolve, contributing significantly to social reform and protection of children's rights.
