### **RAPE AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT**

#### **Introduction**

Rape and Sexual Harassment are grave offenses against women under the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023, falling under Module V dealing with Offenses Against Women. While both involve sexual conduct violating a woman's dignity and autonomy, they differ significantly in their nature, ingredients, and severity. **Rape** (Sections 63-73 BNS) is the most serious sexual offense involving non-consensual sexual intercourse, while **Sexual Harassment** (Section 75 BNS) involves unwelcome sexual advances or conduct of a sexual nature without penetration. Both offenses recognize women's fundamental right to bodily autonomy and dignity.

### **I. RAPE (Sections 63-73 BNS)**

#### **Definition (Section 63 BNS)**

**Previously Section 375 IPC**

A man is said to commit **"rape"** if he:
- Has sexual intercourse with a woman
- Under circumstances falling within any of the **seven descriptions** specified

#### **Critical Elements**

**1. Sexual Intercourse**:
- Penetration is sufficient to constitute sexual intercourse
- Extent of penetration immaterial

**2. By Man with Woman**:
- Accused must be male
- Victim must be female

**3. Circumstances of Non-Consent or Vitiated Consent**

---

### **II. 7 CIRCUMSTANCES CONSTITUTING RAPE**

---

#### **1️⃣ Against Her Will**

**Meaning**: Sexual intercourse **against the woman's will**

- Woman expressly refuses or resists
- Force used to overpower her resistance
- Clear lack of consent

**Example**: Man forcibly has intercourse despite woman's resistance and refusal.

---

#### **2️⃣ Without Her Consent**

**Meaning**: Sexual intercourse **without consent**

**Distinction from "Against Will"**:
- **Against will**: Active resistance/refusal
- **Without consent**: Passive - woman unable to express consent

**Situations**:
- Woman unconscious
- Woman in vegetative state
- Woman asleep
- Woman under influence of drugs/alcohol (unable to consent)

**Example**: Man has intercourse with unconscious woman - no consent possible.

---

#### **3️⃣ Consent Obtained by Fear of Death/Hurt**

**Meaning**: Consent obtained by putting woman or any person in whom she is interested, in **fear of death or hurt**

**Key Points**:
- Consent exists but **vitiated by fear**
- Fear can be of harm to woman herself or to others (family, children)
- Threat of death or hurt

**Example**: Man threatens to kill woman's child unless she consents - consent vitiated by fear.

---

#### **4️⃣ Consent by Mistaken Belief (Lawful Husband)**

**Meaning**: Man induces woman to believe he is her husband or person with whom she is **lawfully married**

**Key Points**:
- Woman consents believing man is her husband
- Deception about identity
- Consent obtained by fraud

**Example**: Man impersonates woman's husband in dark room - woman consents thinking he is her husband.

---

#### **5️⃣ Consent - Mental Unsoundness or Intoxication**

**Meaning**: Consent when woman, at time of giving consent:
- Unable to understand **nature and consequences** of act, due to:
  - **Unsoundness of mind**, OR
  - **Intoxication**, OR
  - **Stupefying substance** administered

**Key Points**:
- Woman incapable of understanding what she is consenting to
- Capacity to consent vitiated

**Example**: Woman given intoxicating substance without knowledge, then man has intercourse - she cannot meaningfully consent.

---

#### **6️⃣ Consent of Minor (Below 18 Years)**

**Meaning**: **With or without consent**, when woman is **under eighteen years of age**

**Critical Point**: **Consent irrelevant if below 18**

**Rationale**:
- Minor cannot give valid consent for sexual intercourse
- Protection of children
- Statutory rape

**Example**: Man has consensual intercourse with 16-year-old girl - still rape (consent invalid due to age).

---

#### **7️⃣ Unable to Communicate Consent**

**Meaning**: When woman is **unable to communicate consent**

**Situations**:
- Physical disability preventing communication
- Speech/hearing impairment
- Other conditions preventing expression of consent

**Key Point**: Taking advantage of inability to communicate

**Example**: Man has intercourse with woman who is paralyzed and cannot communicate her refusal.

---

**3️⃣ Showing Pornography**:

### **V. CONSENT - CRITICAL ANALYSIS**

#### **Rape - Consent Absent or Vitiated**

**No Consent**:
- Against will (Circumstance 1)
- Without consent (Circumstance 2)
- Unable to communicate (Circumstance 7)

**Vitiated Consent**:
- By fear (Circumstance 3)
- By fraud of identity (Circumstance 4)
- Due to unsoundness/intoxication (Circumstance 5)

**Invalid Consent**:
- Minor below 18 (Circumstance 6) - consent irrelevant

#### **Sexual Harassment - Unwelcome**

- Conduct must be **unwelcome**
- Woman does not desire or invite such conduct
- Different standard from rape's "consent"

---

### **VI. PUNISHMENT PROVISIONS**

**Rape** (Section 64 BNS):
- **Minimum 7 years** imprisonment (can extend to **10 years**) + fine
- Aggravated forms: **10 years to life** or life
- Gang rape: **20 years to life** or life

**Sexual Harassment** (Section 75 BNS):
- Imprisonment up to **3 years**, OR
- Fine, OR
- Both

**Note**: Vast difference in punishment reflects greater seriousness of rape.

---

### **Conclusion**

Rape and sexual harassment are distinct offenses with rape being the most serious sexual offense under BNS 2023. The critical distinction lies in the presence of **sexual intercourse** - rape involves non-consensual or vitiated-consent sexual intercourse under seven specified circumstances, while sexual harassment involves unwelcome sexual conduct without penetration, including physical contact, demands for sexual favors, sexually colored remarks, or showing pornography. 

The seven circumstances under which intercourse constitutes rape comprehensively cover all situations of non-consent or invalid consent, including force, fear, fraud, mental incapacity, minority, and inability to communicate. The law's recognition of these circumstances ensures protection of women's sexual autonomy and bodily integrity. The significant difference in punishment - minimum 7 years for rape versus maximum 3 years for sexual harassment - reflects the gravity distinction, while both offenses affirm that women have the fundamental right to say "no" to unwelcome sexual conduct and to have their consent respected.
