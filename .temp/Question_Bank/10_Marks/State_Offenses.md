### **OFFENSES AGAINST THE STATE**

#### **Introduction**

Offenses against the State are the most serious category of crimes under the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023, covered under **Sections 147-156** (previously Sections 121-130 IPC). These offenses strike at the very foundation of state sovereignty, security, and governance. They include waging war against the Government, sedition, and allied offenses.

### **Conclusion**

Offenses against the State under BNS 2023 represent the gravest category of crimes, threatening state sovereignty and public order. **Waging war** is the most serious, involving organized armed insurrection against the Government, punishable with death or life imprisonment. **Sedition** involves bringing Government into hatred, contempt, or disaffection through words, signs, or representations, but recent judicial interpretation requires incitement to violence or public disorder, not mere criticism. 

The law carefully balances **state security** with **fundamental rights** like freedom of speech, ensuring that genuine criticism and dissent through lawful means remain protected while punishing acts that threaten state existence or incite violence. Other offenses like assaulting constitutional authorities, waging war against allied powers, and allowing prisoners to escape complete the framework protecting state security. These provisions, while severe, are essential for maintaining sovereignty, territorial integrity, and constitutional governance.
