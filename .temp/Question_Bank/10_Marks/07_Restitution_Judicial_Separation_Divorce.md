## ❓ QUESTION 2

**Q2-DIV-10M:** Discuss the provision relating to divorce by mutual consent under Section 13B of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.

### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Section 13B, introduced by the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976, provides for divorce by mutual consent - a revolutionary provision that marked a shift from fault-based to no-fault divorce in Indian matrimonial law. This provision recognizes that when both parties agree their marriage has broken down and cannot be revived, they should be able to dissolve it by mutual agreement without proving any matrimonial offense. This represents a more humane, dignified, and practical approach to divorce.

---

### **SECTION 13B: STATUTORY PROVISION**

**Text of Section 13B(1):**
"Subject to the provisions of this Act a petition for dissolution of marriage by a decree of divorce may be presented to the district court by both the parties to a marriage together... on the ground that they have been living separately for a period of one year or more, that they have not been able to live together and that they have mutually agreed that the marriage should be dissolved."

---

### **ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS**

**Four Requirements:**

**1. Joint Petition:**
- Both parties must petition **together**
- Not separate individual petitions
- Joint application essential

**2. Living Separately:**
- Parties must have been **living separately** for **1 year or more**

- Cannot continue marital relationship

**4. Mutual Agreement:**

  - Not obtained by force, fraud, or coercion
  - Genuine agreement

---

---

### **WITHDRAWAL OF CONSENT**

**Right to Withdraw:**

**Effect of Withdrawal:**
- Petition dismissed
- No divorce granted
- Marriage continues

**Case Law:**
**Sureshta Devi v. Om Prakash (AIR 1992 SC 1904):**
- Right to withdraw exists until second motion heard
- After second motion and decree, no withdrawal possible

**After Second Motion:**
Once second motion heard and decree passed, withdrawal not possible (except through appeal).

---

### **NO NEED TO PROVE GROUNDS**

**Important Principle:**

**Vishnu Dutt Sharma v. Manju Sharma (AIR 2009 SC 489):**
- No need to prove any traditional ground (adultery, cruelty, desertion)
- Mutual consent itself sufficient
- Court should not deny decree if Section 13B conditions satisfied
- Court cannot investigate reasons for breakdown
- Parties' decision to separate respected

**Rationale:**
- Parties know their relationship best
- Forcing continuation of marriage serves no purpose
- Dignified exit without fault-finding

---

### **ADVANTAGES OF MUTUAL CONSENT DIVORCE**

**1. No Fault-Finding:**
- No need to prove matrimonial offense
- Preserves dignity of both parties
- No character assassination

**2. Faster Process:**
- Quicker than contested divorce
- Minimum time: 18 months (1 yr separation + 6 months cooling + 6 months for motion)
- Contested divorces take years

**3. Less Acrimonious:**
- Cooperative approach
- Reduces bitterness
- Better for children

**4. Privacy:**
- No public airing of marital problems
- Private arrangement
- Confidential settlement

**5. Control:**
- Parties retain control
- Can negotiate terms (custody, maintenance, property)
- Not imposed by court

**6. Cost-Effective:**
- Less litigation
- Lower legal fees
- No prolonged court battles

---

### **PRACTICAL ASPECTS**

**Settlement:**
Parties typically settle:
- Custody of children
- Maintenance/alimony
- Property division
- Other terms

**Incorporated in Petition:**
Settlement terms incorporated, court approves if reasonable.

**If Settlement Disputed:**
May lead to withdrawal by one party.

---

### **LIMITATIONS AND CRITICISMS**

**1. Waiting Period:**
- 1 year separation + 6 months cooling = long
- Criticism: Unnecessarily prolongs inevitable

**2. Withdrawal Risk:**
- One party can withdraw before second motion
- Creates uncertainty
- May be used for bargaining

**3. Pressure:**
- One party may pressure other for mutual consent
- Settlement negotiations may involve coercion

**4. Children's Interest:**
- May not adequately protect children's rights
- Focus on parties' wishes

---

### **RECENT JUDICIAL TRENDS**

**Courts' Approach:**
- Liberal interpretation
- Encourage mutual consent divorces
- Reduce cooling period in some cases (using Article 142)
- Recognize irretrievable breakdown

**Law Commission Recommendations:**
- Reduce separation period
- Reduce cooling period
- Irretrievable breakdown as explicit ground

---

#### **CONCLUSION**

Section 13B represents a progressive, humane approach to divorce, acknowledging that when both parties agree their marriage cannot be salvaged, law should facilitate dissolution rather than forcing them to prove fault. The two-motion procedure with cooling period ensures decision is not impulsive while providing opportunity for reconciliation. Despite limitations, mutual consent divorce has become most popular divorce route, reflecting modern understanding that marriage should be based on mutual willingness and forcing parties to remain married against their wishes serves neither individual nor social interest. This provision exemplifies evolution of Hindu marriage law from indissoluble sacrament to a relationship that, while valued, can be dissolved by mutual agreement when it fails.

## ❓ QUESTION 2

**Q2-RCR-10M:** What is restitution of conjugal rights? Discuss its constitutional validity in light of judicial pronouncements.

### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Restitution of conjugal rights under Section 9 of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 is a unique matrimonial remedy aimed at reconciliation. It enables a spouse to seek court's assistance in compelling the other spouse to resume cohabitation when withdrawal from society has occurred without reasonable excuse. This remedy has been subject to constitutional challenges, with courts ultimately upholding its validity while recognizing it cannot be enforced by physical force.

---

### **SECTION 9: STATUTORY PROVISION**

**Text:**
"When either the husband or the wife has, without reasonable excuse, withdrawn from the society of the other, the aggrieved party may apply, by petition to the district court, for restitution of conjugal rights and the court, on being satisfied of the truth of the statements made in such petition and that there is no legal ground why the application should not be granted, may decree restitution of conjugal rights accordingly."

---

### **CONCEPT OF CONJUGAL RIGHTS**

**Conjugal Rights Include:**
- Right to cohabitation (living together)
- Right to consortium (companionship)
- Right to marital relations
- Right to mutual comfort and assistance
- Right to society of spouse

**3. No Legal Ground to Refuse:**
Court satisfied no legal impediment exists.

---

### **EFFECT OF DECREE**

---

### **CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES**

#### **CHALLENGE 1: T. SAREETHA (Andhra Pradesh High Court)**

**T. Sareetha v. T. Venkata Subbaiah (AIR 1983 AP 356)**

**Arguments Against Section 9:**
- Violates **Article 21** (Right to Life and Personal Liberty)

- Tantamount to "marital rape"
- Violates **Article 14** (Equality)

**AP High Court Held:**

- Cannot compel person to live with another

---

#### **CHALLENGE 2: HARVINDER KAUR (Delhi High Court)**

**Harvinder Kaur v. Harmander Singh (AIR 1984 Del 66)**

**Delhi HC Held:**
- Section 9 is **CONSTITUTIONAL** and valid
- Does not violate Article 21
- Purpose is reconciliation, not forced cohabitation
- Decree not executable by force
- Cannot be enforced through physical compulsion
- Promotes institution of marriage

**Reasoning:**
- Section 9 aims at saving marriage
- Encourages reconciliation

- Reasonable restriction in interest of marriage institution

---

#### **SUPREME COURT: SAROJ RANI (Final Word)**

**Saroj Rani v. Sudarshan Kumar (AIR 1984 SC 1562)**

**Supreme Court Held:**
- Section 9 is **CONSTITUTIONALLY VALID**
- Does **not violate** Articles 14 and 21
- Purpose is reconciliation and preservation of marriage
- Cannot be executed by physical force
- Reasonable restriction justified
- Promotes institution of marriage
- Gives opportunity for cooling period and reflection

**Ratio:**

- Section 9 provides opportunity for reconciliation
- Enforcement mechanism (contempt) applies only to disobedience of court order, not physical forcing
- After 1 year, divorce option available

**Current Law:**
Section 9 continues to be **valid and operative** throughout India.

---

### **CRITICISM AND DEBATE**

**Arguments Against (Despite Validity):**

1. **Rarely Leads to Reconciliation:**
- Most decrees not complied with
- Used as stepping stone to divorce
- 1-year mandatory wait prolongs inevitable

2. **Privacy Concerns:**
- Intrusion into personal autonomy
- Right to choose with whom to live

3. **Human Rights:**
- UN committees expressed concern
- Forced cohabitation issues

4. **Gender Dimension:**
- Though gender-neutral, often affects women
- Power imbalance in marriage

**Arguments in Favor:**

1. **Saves Marriages:**
- Some couples do reconcile
- Provides cooling period

2. **Cultural Context:**
- Marriage valued in Indian society
- Family pressure can help reconciliation

3. **Not Forcible:**
- Cannot be executed by force
- Only moral pressure

4. **Alternative Available:**
- After 1 year, divorce option exists
- Not permanent trap

---

#### **CONCLUSION**

Restitution of conjugal rights under Section 9, despite constitutional challenges, has been upheld by the Supreme Court in Saroj Rani v. Sudarshan Kumar as a valid provision aimed at promoting reconciliation and preserving marriages. While the Andhra Pradesh High Court struck it down in T. Sareetha, the Supreme Court's contrary view prevails, establishing that Section 9 does not violate fundamental rights as it cannot be enforced by physical force and provides for divorce after 1-year non-compliance.

The continuing debate reflects tension between individual autonomy and social interest in preserving marriages. In practice, restitution rarely leads to genuine reconciliation and often merely prolongs proceedings before inevitable divorce. However, as it stands, Section 9 remains part of Hindu matrimonial law, serving as first step in matrimonial relief framework and providing cooling period before more drastic step of divorce.
