### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

#### **INTRODUCTION**

The Mitakshara School is one of the two major schools of Hindu Law, founded by Vijnaneshwara's 11th-century commentary on Yajnavalkya Smriti. Applicable to most of India except Bengal and Assam, it established key concepts of birthright, coparcenary, and survivorship that fundamentally shaped Hindu inheritance law. The school further developed into five regional sub-schools, each with distinctive features while maintaining core Mitakshara principles.

## ❓ QUESTION 2

**Q2-SCH-10M:** Discuss the doctrine of "birthright" and "survivorship" under Mitakshara School. How have statutory reforms affected these concepts?

### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Two fundamental doctrines distinguish Mitakshara School from Dayabhaga: the doctrine of birthright and the doctrine of survivorship. These concepts revolutionized Hindu inheritance law by giving sons present interest in ancestral property from birth and determining succession through survivorship rather than regular inheritance. Understanding these doctrines is crucial for comprehending Mitakshara coparcenary system and its evolution through statutory reforms.

---

### **PART I: DOCTRINE OF BIRTHRIGHT**

**Concept:**
Under Mitakshara, a son acquires an **interest by birth** in coparcenary (ancestral) property.

**Key Features:**

**1. Automatic Acquisition:**
- Interest accrues **immediately upon birth**
- No act of father required
- No registration or formality necessary
- Automatic operation of law

**2. Present Interest (Not Expectancy):**
- Son has present, immediate interest
- Not mere hope of inheritance (spes successionis)
- Can claim and enforce rights during father's lifetime

**3. Ancestral Property:**
Birthright applies only to **ancestral property**:
- Property inherited by father from father, grandfather, or great-grandfather
- Property inherited up to three degrees

**Self-Acquired Property:**
Father's self-acquired property: No birthright; father has absolute control.

---

**LEGAL CONSEQUENCES OF BIRTHRIGHT:**

**A. Father's Limited Power:**
- Father cannot alienate coparcenary property without son's consent
- Exception: Legal necessity or benefit of estate

**B. Son Can Challenge:**
- Son can challenge unauthorized alienation
- Sale/gift without necessity voidable

**C. Partition Right:**
- Son can demand partition as matter of right
- Force division of coparcenary property

**D. Right Survives Father:**
- If father dies, son still has share
- Share passes to son's heirs

---

**CASE LAWS:**

**Suraj Narain v. Iqbal Narain (AIR 1953 All 221):**
- Son's birthright cannot be defeated by father's alienation without legal necessity

**Gurupad Khandappa Magdum v. Hirabai (AIR 1978 SC 1239):**
- Father has limited power to alienate coparcenary property
- Must be for legal necessity or benefit of estate

---

**ILLUSTRATION:**

**Scenario:**
```
Grandfather G dies leaving property
↓
Father F inherits (becomes ancestral for F's sons)
↓
Son S is born
↓
S immediately gets birthright in property F inherited
↓
F cannot sell without S's consent (unless necessity)
```

---

### **2005 AMENDMENT IMPACT ON BIRTHRIGHT:**

**Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005:**
- Extended birthright to **daughters**
- Daughters become coparceners by birth equal to sons
- Interest accrues from birth
- All coparcenary rights

**Vineeta Sharma v. Rakesh Sharma (2020):**
- Supreme Court: Daughter's birthright applies retrospectively
- Rights accrue irrespective of father being alive or dead
- Landmark judgment for women's property rights

---

### **PART II: DOCTRINE OF SURVIVORSHIP**

**Concept:**
On death of a coparcener, his share does not pass by **succession** but by **survivorship** to surviving coparceners.

**Principle:**
Interest of deceased coparcener automatically expands and merges with shares of surviving coparceners.

**Key Features:**

**1. Automatic Operation:**
- No will required
- No succession formalities
- Instant expansion

**2. Only Among Coparceners:**
- Applies only between coparceners
- Not to other family members

**3. Per Capita Division:**
- Share distributed equally among survivors
- Not per stirpes

---

**HOW SURVIVORSHIP WORKS:**

**Illustration:**
```
A, B, C, D are coparceners (each 1/4 share)
↓
D dies (no Class I heirs)
↓
D's 1/4 share merges by survivorship
↓
A, B, C now each have 1/3 share
```

**Formula:**
Surviving coparceners = Deceased's share ÷ Number of survivors
Each survivor gets equal portion of deceased's share added to own.

---

**EXCEPTION TO SURVIVORSHIP:**

**Hindu Succession Act, 1956:**

If deceased coparcener leaves **Class I heirs**:
- Widow
- Son, daughter
- Mother
- Son's children, daughter's children, etc.

Then survivorship does NOT apply. Property passes by **succession** to Class I heirs.

**Rule:**
Survivorship applies only if NO Class I heirs.

**Illustration:**
```
A, B (son), C (son) are coparceners
↓
B dies leaving widow W and daughter D (Class I heirs)
↓
NO survivorship
↓
B's share passes to W and D by succession
(NOT to A and C by survivorship)
```

---

**RATIONALE FOR SURVIVORSHIP:**

**1. Unity of Property:**
- Coparcenary property held in common
- No defined individual shares
- Community of interest

**2. Keeping Property in Male Line:**
- Historically, kept property in agnatic (male) line
- Prevented fragmentation

**3. Simplicity:**
- Automatic operation
- No succession formalities
- No probate required

---

### **CONTRAST WITH SUCCESSION**

| **Aspect** | **Survivorship** | **Succession** |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Trigger** | Death of coparcener | Death of owner |
| **To Whom** | Surviving coparceners | Heirs (as per law/will) |
| **Nature** | Automatic expansion | Transfer/inheritance |
| **Formality** | None required | Succession certificate/probate |
| **Scope** | Only coparcenary property | All property |
| **School** | Mitakshara | Dayabhaga + Modern Law |

---

### **PART III: STATUTORY REFORMS**

#### **HINDU SUCCESSION ACT, 1956**

**Impact on Birthright:**
- Retained for coparcenary property
- But succession rules unified
- Class I heirs concept introduced
- Exception to survivorship created

**Impact on Survivorship:**
- Modified by Class I heirs provision
- If Class I heirs exist, they inherit
- Pure survivorship applies only if no Class I heirs

---

#### **2005 AMENDMENT - REVOLUTIONARY CHANGE**

**Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005:**

**Section 6 Amended:**
- Daughters made coparceners by birth
- Equal to sons in all respects
- Interest from birth in coparcenary property

**Impact on Birthright:**
- Daughters now have birthright
- Equal share
- Can demand partition
- Father cannot alienate without daughter's consent

**Impact on Survivorship:**
- Daughters' shares also pass by survivorship
- Or to their Class I heirs

**Retroactive Application:**
**Vineeta Sharma v. Rakesh Sharma (2020) 9 SCC 1:**
- Three-judge bench held: Rights accrue from 9th September 2005 regardless of when father died
- Daughter has rights even if father died before 2005
- Landmark for women's property rights

---

### **MODERN POSITION**

**What Remains:**
- Birthright concept continues (now for daughters too)
- Coparcenary system operational
- Survivorship applies (with Class I exception)
- Partition rights exercisable

**What Changed:**
- Gender equality achieved
- Daughters equal coparceners
- Modified survivorship (Class I heirs)
- Unified succession rules

**Practical Relevance:**
- Property disputes still invoke these concepts
- Courts apply birthright and survivorship principles
- Partition cases common
- Understanding essential for legal practice

---

#### **CONCLUSION**

The doctrines of birthright and survivorship are cornerstone principles of Mitakshara School, creating unique property system where sons (now daughters too) acquire present interest by birth and shares pass by survivorship to surviving coparceners. While Hindu Succession Act, 1956 modified pure survivorship by introducing Class I heirs exception, and 2005 Amendment extended birthright to daughters achieving gender equality, these Mitakshara concepts remain central to understanding coparcenary property and joint family law. They represent sophisticated juristic thought balancing individual rights with family cohesion, though now reformed to align with constitutional values of equality and women's rights.
