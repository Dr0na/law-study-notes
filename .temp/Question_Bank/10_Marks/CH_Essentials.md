### **ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS OF CULPABLE HOMICIDE**

#### **Introduction**

Culpable Homicide is defined under **Section 100 of the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023** (previously Section 299 of the Indian Penal Code). The term "homicide" is derived from Latin words **"homo"** (man) and **"caedere"** (to cut or kill), meaning the killing of a human being. Not all homicides are culpable (punishable). The law distinguishes between lawful homicide (e.g., in self-defense, by lawful authority) and unlawful homicide which is culpable. Culpable Homicide consists of both **physical** and **mental** elements, both of which must be proved to establish the offense.

#### **Definition (Section 100 BNS)**

"Whoever causes death by doing an act with the **intention of causing death**, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is **likely to cause death**, or with the **knowledge** that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide."

---

### **I. ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF CULPABLE HOMICIDE**

Culpable Homicide has two essential elements:
1. **Physical Element (Actus Reus)**
2. **Mental Element (Mens Rea)**

---

### **II. PHYSICAL ELEMENT (ACTUS REUS)**

#### **1. Causing of Death**

- There must be actual **death** of a human being
- Death must be the **direct result** of the accused's act or omission
- The act must be the proximate cause of death

**Test**: A person causes actus reus if that actus would not have occurred without his participation.

#### **2. Nature of Act**

The act should be of such nature that:
- It would put someone's life in **peril**, OR
- It would damage someone's life to such extent that the person would **die**

**Characteristics**:
- Usually involves a **high degree of violence** against the person
- But in special circumstances, may not involve extreme violence

#### **3. Examples of Acts Constituting Culpable Homicide**

**Acts involving direct violence**:
- Stabbing a person in vital organs
- Shooting someone at point-blank range
- Administering poison
- Bludgeoning on head with blunt instrument

**Acts not involving direct violence but causing death**:
- Starving someone (denying food and water until death)
- Confining a terminally ill person and denying medication
- Locking someone in airtight room causing suffocation

**Illustration from Section 100**:
- Y is diagnosed with terminal illness and needs certain drugs to live from day to day
- A confines him in a room and denies him his medication
- Y dies as a result
- A is guilty of culpable homicide (physical element satisfied)

#### **4. Act Done Under Lawful Authority**

**Exception**: When law commands or permits the harm to be inflicted:
- A duly appointed executioner putting condemned criminal to death
- Killing enemy soldier in war
- No criminal liability arises in such cases

---

### **III. MENTAL ELEMENT (MENS REA) - THREE FORMS**

The mental element is the most critical component of Culpable Homicide. The accused must have one of the following three mental states:

---

#### **FORM A: INTENTION OF CAUSING DEATH**

**Requirement**: The act is committed with **direct intention** of causing death.

**Key Features**:
- Positive intention to kill
- Accused deliberately acts with idea that person will die
- There must be specific intent to cause death

**Distinction**:
- If person pushes someone for joke and person falls, hits head and dies → **No intention** (not CH)
- If person deliberately pushes someone with idea that person will fall and die → **Intention present** (CH)

**Examples**:
1. A shoots B aiming at B's heart with intention to kill → Intention of causing death
2. A strangles B by neck until B dies → Intention of causing death
3. A administers deadly poison to B knowing it will kill → Intention of causing death

**Illustration from Section 100**:
- A shoots Z with a gun, shooting him through the heart
- Z dies as a consequence
- A has committed culpable homicide (intention of causing death)

---

#### **FORM B: INTENTION OF CAUSING BODILY INJURY LIKELY TO CAUSE DEATH**

**Requirement**: The accused intends to cause **such bodily injury as is likely to cause death**.

**Key Features**:
- Accused intends to cause bodily injury (not necessarily death itself)
- The bodily injury intended is of such nature that it is **likely** to cause death
- Does not require certainty of death, only likelihood

**Two Types of Situations**:

**Type 1: Direct Bodily Injury Causing Death**
- Bodily injury itself is done in fashion which causes death
- Example: Bludgeoning someone on head repeatedly with blunt instrument
- The injury directly leads to death

**Type 2: Bodily Injury + Intervening Events**
- There are injuries and intervening events between injuries and death
- Provided delay is not too blatant
- Must prove injuries were administered with intention

**Proof Required**:
- The act must be of nature that bodily injury is **intended**
- Bodily injury must be **likely** to cause death

**Examples**:
1. A repeatedly beats B on head with iron rod knowing such injury likely to cause death
2. A stabs B in stomach multiple times, causing injuries likely to result in death
3. A throws B from height knowing fall likely to cause death

**Illustration from Section 100**:
- A knowing that Z is laboring under such disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with intention of causing bodily injury
- Z dies in consequence of the blow
- A is guilty of culpable homicide

---

#### **FORM C: KNOWLEDGE THAT ACT IS LIKELY TO CAUSE DEATH**

**Requirement**: The accused has **knowledge** that the act he commits is likely to cause death.

**Key Features**:
- Distinguished from **intention**
- Person may not **intend** to kill
- But person **knows** that the act will likely take someone's life

**Distinction: Knowledge vs Intention**

**Knowledge**:
- Bare state of conscious awareness of certain facts
- Person knows act will likely cause death but may not desire it
- Mind might remain supine or inactive

**Intention**:
- Conscious state where mental faculties are roused into activity
- Directed toward specific end
- Person positively wants to cause death

**Test**: Would a reasonable person in accused's position know that the act is likely to cause death?

**Examples**:
1. A doctor uses infected syringe knowingly on patient
   - Act by itself will not directly cause death
   - But doctor has knowledge that actions will lead to death by infection

2. A drives vehicle at high speed through crowded market
   - May not intend to kill anyone
   - But has knowledge that act likely to cause death

3. A sets up trap/pit and covers it, knowing persons likely to fall and die
   - May not intend specific person's death
   - But has knowledge that act likely to cause death

**Illustration from Section 100**:
- A knows Z to be behind a bush
- B does not know it
- A, intending to cause or knowing it to be likely to cause Z's death, induces B to fire at the bush
- B fires and kills Z
- Here, B may be guilty of no offense (no knowledge)
- But A has committed culpable homicide (knowledge present)

**Another Illustration**:
- A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the knowledge that death is likely to be thereby caused
- Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed
- A has committed culpable homicide (knowledge present)

### **IV. ILLUSTRATIONS SUMMARIZED**

| **Illustration** | **Element Satisfied** | **Type** |
|-----------------|----------------------|----------|
| Confining terminally ill person, denying medication | Intention of causing death OR Knowledge | Form A or C |
| Mowing over pedestrian deliberately | Intention of causing bodily injury likely to cause death | Form B |
| Inducing another to fire at bush knowing person behind it | Knowledge that act likely to cause death | Form C |
| Laying trap over pit knowing persons likely to fall | Knowledge that act likely to cause death | Form C |

---

### **V. RELATIONSHIP WITH MURDER**

**Important Distinction**:
- Culpable Homicide is the **genus** (broader category)
- Murder is the **species** (specific type)
- **All murders are culpable homicides**, but **all culpable homicides are not murders**

**When CH becomes Murder**:
Section 101 BNS specifies four situations when culpable homicide amounts to murder (requires higher degree of intention/knowledge)

**When CH does NOT amount to Murder**:
Section 101 provides five exceptions where even though all elements of murder are satisfied, it is reduced to culpable homicide

---

### **VI. CAUSATION PRINCIPLE**

**General Rule**: An event may be caused by one factor if it would not have happened without that factor.

**Application**: A person causes death (actus reus) if that death would not have occurred without his participation.

**Intervening Cause**: If another person's act intervenes and becomes more immediate and direct cause, original accused may be excused.

**Contributory Negligence**: Victim's own negligence does not absolve accused if accused's act was proximate cause.

---

### **VII. PUNISHMENT**

**Section 105 BNS** (Previously Section 304 IPC)

**Part I**: If act done with **intention** or **knowledge that death will be caused**:
- Imprisonment for life, OR
- Imprisonment up to 10 years + Fine

**Part II**: If act done with **knowledge** that act is **likely** to cause death:
- Imprisonment up to 10 years, OR
- Fine, OR
- Both

---

### **Conclusion**

Culpable Homicide is a serious offense requiring both physical and mental elements. The physical element requires causing of death by an act. The mental element has three forms - intention of causing death, intention of causing bodily injury likely to cause death, or knowledge that act is likely to cause death. The law carefully distinguishes between different degrees of mens rea to ensure proportionate punishment. All three forms must be understood thoroughly as they form the foundation for understanding the distinction between culpable homicide and murder.
