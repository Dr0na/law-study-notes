### **MISTAKE OF FACT AND MISTAKE OF LAW**

#### **Introduction**

Mistake is one of the important defenses available to an accused person to get exemption from criminal liability under the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023. The term "mistake" means commission or omission of an act ignorantly or unintentionally causing injury. It represents unconscious ignorance or forgetfulness of a fact. A court determines guilt on the basis of **believed facts**, not real facts. The fundamental principle governing this defense is enshrined in the Latin maxim: **"Ignorantia facti excusat, ignorantia juris non-excusat"** which means **"Ignorance of fact excuses, ignorance of law does not excuse"**.

---

### **I. THE FUNDAMENTAL MAXIM**

**"Ignorantia facti excusat, ignorantia juris non-excusat"**

This maxim establishes two cardinal principles:

**1️⃣ Ignorance of Fact Excuses (Ignorantia facti excusat)**
- A person cannot be blamed for not knowing facts
- If person makes honest mistake about factual circumstances, may be excused
- Law recognizes that facts may not be known or may be misunderstood

**2️⃣ Ignorance of Law Does NOT Excuse (Ignorantia juris non-excusat)**
- Everyone is **presumed to know the law**
- Cannot claim as defense that one did not know act was illegal
- If allowed, every accused would claim ignorance of law
- Would encourage people not to learn the law

**Rationale**:
- Facts are infinite and may not be known
- Laws are published and accessible - everyone expected to know them
- Maintaining law and order requires presumption of knowledge of law

---

### **II. SECTION 14 BNS: ACT DONE BY PERSON BOUND BY LAW**

#### **Provision** (Previously Section 76 IPC)

"Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is, or who by reason of a **mistake of fact** and not by reason of a mistake of law in **good faith** believes that he is, **bound by law** to do it."

#### **Essential Ingredients**

**1. Mistake of Fact** (not mistake of law)
- The person must act by reason of mistake about factual circumstances
- Does not apply to mistake about legal provisions

**2. Good Faith**
- Act must be done honestly
- With **due care and attention**
- As a reasonable person would act in circumstances

**3. Belief of Being Bound by Law**
- Person believes himself under **legal compulsion**
- Thinks he has **legal duty** to do the act
- Must do it as required by law

#### **Meaning of "Bound by Law"**

**"Bound by law"** means person thinks he is under **legal compulsion** or has **legal duty** to perform the act.

**Examples**:
- Police officer executing warrant
- Soldier following superior's lawful order
- Public servant carrying out court order
- Person complying with summons

#### **Illustration from Section**

- A, a soldier, fires on a mob by order of superior officer in conformity with commands of law
- A has committed no offense
- A believed he was **bound by law** to follow lawful order

---

### **III. SECTION 17 BNS: ACT JUSTIFIED BY LAW**

#### **Provision** (Previously Section 79 IPC)

"Nothing is an offence which is done by any person who is **justified by law**, or who by reason of a **mistake of fact** and not by reason of a mistake of law in **good faith** believes himself to be justified by law, in doing it."

#### **Essential Ingredients**

**1. Mistake of Fact** (same as Section 14)

**2. Good Faith** (same as Section 14)

**3. Belief of Being Justified by Law**
- Person believes there is **legal justification** for action
- Not compulsion, but **legal permission** or **legal right**
- Act is legally permissible or authorized

#### **Meaning of "Justified by Law"**

**"Justified by law"** means person thinks he has **legal right** or **legal justification** to do the act (not that he must do it).

**Examples**:
- Person exercising right of private defense
- Parent disciplining child (within legal limits)
- Person preventing breach of peace
- Citizen making lawful arrest

#### **Illustration from Section**

- A, under influence of madness, attempts to kill B
- B, in exercise of right of private defense, kills A
- B believed he was **justified by law** in killing to protect himself
- B has committed no offense

### **IV. DISTINCTION: SECTION 14 vs SECTION 17**

| **Aspect** | **Section 14 (Bound by Law)** | **Section 17 (Justified by Law)** |
|------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Key Phrase** | "**Bound by law**" | "**Justified by law**" |
| **Belief** | Under legal **compulsion** | Legal **justification** exists |
| **Nature** | Legal **duty** to do act | Legal **right** to do act |
| **Mindset** | "I **must** do this by law" | "I **may** do this by law" |
| **Example** | Police executing warrant | Person exercising private defense |

**Common Elements**:
- Both require **mistake of fact** (not law)
- Both require **good faith**
- Both provide complete immunity
- Both look at **believed circumstances**

---

### **V. THREE CONDITIONS FOR MISTAKE DEFENSE**

For accused to get protection on ground of mistake:

#### **1️⃣ State of Things Believed Would Justify Act**

**Requirement**: If facts were as accused believed them to be, act would have been lawful.

**Example**: If A believes Z is burglar (but Z is innocent), and uses force - IF Z had actually been burglar, force would be justified.

#### **2️⃣ Mistake Must Be Reasonable**

**Requirement**: A reasonable person in accused's position would have made same mistake.

**Test**: Not what accused thought, but what **reasonable person** would have thought.

**Example**: Not reasonable to shoot someone without verifying they are a threat.

#### **3️⃣ Mistake Must Relate to Fact, Not Law**

**Requirement**: Mistake must be about factual circumstances, not legal provisions.

**Why**: If mistake of law allowed, every accused would claim ignorance.

---

### **VI. MISTAKE OF FACT vs MISTAKE OF LAW**

#### **A. MISTAKE OF FACT**

**Definition**: Mistake about **factual circumstances** or situation.

**Legal Effect**: **CAN be a defense** if conditions satisfied.

**Examples**:
1. Person takes someone else's property thinking it is his own (mistaken about ownership)
2. Police arrests wrong person believing he is the accused (mistaken identity)
3. Person believes spouse is dead and remarries (mistaken about fact of death)

**Characteristics**:
- Relates to **circumstances** or **events**
- Relates to **existence** or **non-existence** of facts
- Can be verified by evidence
- If reasonable and in good faith, excuses liability

---

#### **B. MISTAKE OF LAW**

**Definition**: Mistake about **what the law is** or **legal consequences**.

**Legal Effect**: **NOT a defense** (general rule).

**Examples**:
1. Person thinks bigamy is not crime (mistaken about legal provision)
2. Person believes certain age sufficient for marriage (mistaken about law)
3. Person misunderstands divorce requirements (mistaken about legal effect)

**Characteristics**:
- Relates to **legal provisions** or **legal status**
- Relates to **interpretation** of law
- Everyone presumed to know the law
- Generally no excuse even if genuine

---

### **VII. IMPORTANT CASE LAWS**

#### **1️⃣ R v. Tolson (1889) - Mistake of Fact as Defense**

**Facts**:
- Woman's husband went missing, told he was lost at sea
- After 7 years, believing him dead, she remarried
- First husband later returned
- Charged with bigamy

**Held**: **NOT GUILTY** - Defense of mistake of fact available.

**Reasoning**:
- She believed in **good faith** that husband was dead
- Belief was **reasonable** (7 years, told ship lost at sea)
- This was **mistake of fact** (about whether husband alive)
- If her belief had been true, second marriage would be lawful

**Principle**: **Reasonable mistake of fact** can be defense if belief honest and reasonable.

---

#### **2️⃣ R v. Prince (1875) - Mistake Must Be Reasonable**

**Facts**:
- Prince took girl below 16 years without parental consent

**Held**: **CONVICTED** - Mistake not a defense.

**Reasoning**:
- Prince did NOT act in **good faith**
- **Failed to make enquiries** about girl's age
- Mistake was **unreasonable**
- A reasonable person would have verified age

**Principle**: Mistake must be **reasonable** with **due care and attention**.

**Distinction from Tolson**:
- **Tolson**: Reasonable to believe husband dead after 7 years
- **Prince**: Unreasonable not to verify girl's age

---

#### **3️⃣ R v. Wheat and Stock - Mistake of Law No Defense**

**Facts**:
- Accused was illiterate
- Misinformed that he had been granted divorce
- Remarried
- Charged with bigamy

**Held**: **GUILTY** of bigamy.

- Even illiteracy and misinformation no defense

**Principle**: **Mistake of law is NOT a defense**.

**Distinction from Tolson**:
- **Tolson**: Mistake of **fact** (believed husband dead) - Defense
- **Wheat**: Mistake of **law** (believed divorced) - NO defense

---

### **VIII. GOOD FAITH: ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT**

**Definition (Section 2(10) BNS)**:
"Nothing is said to be done or believed in good faith which is done or believed without **due care and attention**."

**Requirements**:

**1. Honesty**
- Must act with honest intention
- Not with malice or bad motive

**2. Due Care and Attention**
- Degree of **reasonableness** in care exercised
- What a **prudent person** would do
- Based on:
  - Nature of act
  - Magnitude and importance
  - Facility to exercise care

---

### **IX. EXCEPTIONS: WHEN MISTAKE OF LAW MAY BE DEFENSE**

In **limited circumstances**, mistake of law can be defense:

1. **Law not published**
2. **Statute later declared unconstitutional**
3. **Relied upon judicial decision**
4. **Relied upon official interpretation**

---

### **Conclusion**

The distinction between mistake of fact and mistake of law is fundamental to criminal jurisprudence. While ignorance of fact can excuse if the mistake is reasonable and made in good faith, ignorance of law generally cannot excuse as everyone is presumed to know the law. Sections 14 and 17 of BNS 2023 carefully balance the need to protect those who act on honest and reasonable mistakes with the principle that law must be known and followed. The protection is available only when the mistake relates to facts, the belief is reasonable, and the act is done in good faith with due care and attention. As illustrated by cases like **Tolson** and **Prince**, reasonableness is key - what matters is not merely that the accused believed something, but that a reasonable person in those circumstances would have held the same belief.
