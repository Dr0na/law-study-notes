### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Maintenance pendente lite under Section 24 of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 is a remedial provision ensuring that the financially weaker spouse can effectively participate in matrimonial proceedings. The term "pendente lite" (Latin) means "during litigation," and this provision covers both litigation expenses and monthly maintenance during the pendency of any proceeding under the Act.

### **SECTION 24: STATUTORY PROVISION**

**Text:**
"Where in any proceeding under this Act it appears to the court that either the wife or the husband, as the case may be, has no independent income sufficient for her or his support and the necessary expenses of the proceeding, it may, on the application of the wife or the husband, order the respondent to pay to the petitioner the expenses of the proceeding, and monthly during the proceeding such sum as, having regard to the petitioner's own income and the income of the respondent, it may seem to the court to be reasonable."

**Proviso:**
"...shall, as far as possible, be disposed of within sixty days from the date of service of notice..."

### **PURPOSE AND RATIONALE**

**1. Access to Justice:**
- Ensures financially weak party can afford legal representation
- Prevents economic barrier to justice
- Constitutional imperative (Article 21)

**2. Equality of Arms:**
- Levels playing field between economically unequal parties
- One party shouldn't have unfair advantage due to wealth

**3. Prevent Economic Hardship:**
- Matrimonial litigation can be lengthy
- Prevents destitution during proceedings
- Maintains reasonable living standard

**4. Enable Effective Defense/Claim:**
- Quality legal representation possible
- Can engage competent counsel
- Prepare case properly

---

### **WHO CAN CLAIM**

**Gender Neutral:**
Either **wife** OR **husband** can claim (whoever lacks sufficient income).

**Practical Reality:**
- Predominantly claimed by wives
- Due to economic dependence and lower earning capacity
- But law permits husband to claim if wife wealthier

**Conditions for Claim:**
1. Proceeding under HMA pending (divorce, nullity, JS, restitution, maintenance)
2. Applicant has no independent income sufficient for:
   - Support/maintenance, AND
   - Necessary expenses of proceedings
3. Respondent has means to pay

---

### **WHAT CAN BE CLAIMED**

**Two Components:**

**1. Expenses of Proceedings:**
- **Court fees** (filing fees, process fees)
- **Advocate's fees** (lawyer's professional charges)
- **Expert fees** (if experts engaged)
- **Other costs** (travel, documentation, etc.)

**Lump Sum or Installments:**
Court may order lump sum for litigation expenses.

**2. Monthly Sum During Proceedings:**
- Regular **monthly maintenance**
- For livelihood, accommodation, food
- Medical expenses
- Day-to-day expenses
- Throughout pendency of case

---

### **FACTORS CONSIDERED BY COURT**

**Mnemonic: "RICO"**

**1. Respondent's Income and Property:**
Court examines:
- Salary, business income
- Assets (movable, immovable)
- Investments, savings
- Earning capacity
- Other income sources

**2. Income and Property of Petitioner:**
Court examines:
- Own earnings (if any)
- Assets owned
- Earning capacity and qualifications
- Employment status
- Other support sources

**3. Conduct of Parties:**
- Matrimonial conduct
- Behavior during marriage
- Fault (if any)

**Note:** Conduct relevant but not determinative. Even "guilty" party may get maintenance based on need.

**4. Other Circumstances:**
- Standard of living during marriage
- Social status
- Health and medical needs
- Children's needs (if with claimant)
- Duration of marriage
- Age of parties

---

### **QUANTUM (AMOUNT)**

**No Fixed Formula:**
Court has discretion to determine reasonable amount.

**General Practice:**
Courts often award **25-33% of respondent's net income** as interim maintenance.

**Important:** Guideline only, not rigid rule. Depends on:
- Actual needs
- Paying capacity
- All circumstances

**Lump Sum for Litigation:**
For litigation expenses, court may order lump sum (e.g., ₹50,000, ₹1 lakh) based on:
- Anticipated legal fees
- Court fees
- Complexity of case

---

### **DURATION**

**Starts:** From date of order (or as court directs)

**Continues:** Throughout pendency of main proceedings

**Ends:**
- On final disposal of main proceeding
- Death of either party
- Remarriage of recipient
- As court directs

**After Final Decree:**
Section 24 maintenance ceases. Section 25 (permanent alimony) may then apply.

---

### **TIME LIMIT FOR DISPOSAL**

**60-Day Target [Proviso to Section 24]:**

Application for maintenance pendente lite shall, **as far as possible**, be disposed of within **60 days** from service of notice on respondent.

**Purpose:**
- Ensure quick interim relief
- Prevent delays
- Enable immediate support

**Practical Reality:**
Often delayed beyond 60 days due to:
- Court workload
- Adjournments
- Evidence requirement

However, courts conscious of target and try to expedite.

---

### **MODIFICATION**

**Change in Circumstances:**
Court can modify order if:
- Increase in respondent's income → Increase maintenance
- Decrease in income → Decrease maintenance
- Petitioner obtains employment → Reduce/terminate
- Needs increase/decrease

**On Application:**
Either party can apply showing material change.

---

### **ENFORCEMENT**

**If Not Paid:**
- Execution proceedings under CPC
- Attachment of salary
- Attachment of property
- In extreme cases: Arrest and detention (contempt)

**Court's Coercive Powers:**
- Can enforce through contempt jurisdiction
- Disobedience of court order punishable

---

### **CASE LAWS**

**Chaturbhuj v. Sita Bai (AIR 1970 SC 259):**
- Section 24 is remedial provision
- Should be liberally construed
- Purpose: Enable weaker party to conduct proceedings effectively

**Jasbir Kaur Sehgal v. District Judge (AIR 1997 SC 1796):**
- Court should consider needs of applicant and capacity of respondent
- Quantum should be reasonable and just
- No fixed formula

**Sunita Kachwaha v. Anil Kachwaha (AIR 2015 SC 366):**
- Maintenance pendente lite should be decided expeditiously
- 60-day time limit should be followed as far as possible
- Delay defeats purpose of interim relief

---

### **INTERACTION WITH OTHER PROVISIONS**

**With Section 25:**
- Section 24 is interim (during)
- Section 25 is permanent (after)
- Sequential, not simultaneous

**With Section 125 CrPC:**
- Both can be claimed
- Section 125 amount adjusted against Section 24
- Strategy: File Section 125 first (faster), then HMA

**With Property Rights:**
- Separate from property claims
- Maintenance is personal right
- Not connected to property settlement

---

#### **CONCLUSION**

Section 24 of Hindu Marriage Act represents legislative recognition that access to justice should not be denied due to economic inequality. By providing for litigation expenses and monthly maintenance during proceedings, with a 60-day disposal target, it ensures that the financially dependent spouse can effectively prosecute or defend matrimonial proceedings. The liberal judicial interpretation in cases like Chaturbhuj and emphasis on expeditious disposal in Sunita Kachwaha demonstrate courts' commitment to making this remedial provision effective. As matrimonial litigation can be lengthy, Section 24 serves as crucial support mechanism, embodying principles of equality, access to justice, and prevention of economic hardship.
