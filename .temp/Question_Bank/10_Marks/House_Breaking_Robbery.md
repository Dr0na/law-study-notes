### **HOUSE BREAKING AND ROBBERY**

#### **Introduction**

House breaking and robbery are serious offenses against property under the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023. While house breaking (Section 309 BNS) involves entering or exiting a building through specific illegal means, robbery (Section 309 BNS) involves theft or extortion combined with violence or threat. When house breaking is committed in order to commit robbery, the offense becomes more serious. Dacoity (Section 310 BNS) is an aggravated form of robbery involving five or more persons.

**1️⃣ Breaking Through Wall, Roof, Floor, Door, Window, or Other Part**
- Making opening by force

### **II. WHEN HOUSE BREAKING BECOMES ROBBERY**

#### **Connection Between House Breaking and Robbery**

**House Breaking becomes Robbery when**:
- Person commits **house-breaking** (enters/exits by any of 6 ways)
- **After** house-breaking, commits theft or extortion
- OR commits theft/extortion and uses house-breaking to **exit**

**Section 311 BNS**: "If any person, in committing or in attempting to commit robbery, voluntarily causes hurt, such person and any other person jointly concerned in committing or attempting to commit such robbery, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine."

**Aggravating Factors**:
- If hurt caused during robbery → Enhanced punishment
- House breaking + Robbery = More serious offense

---

### **III. ROBBERY (Section 309 BNS)**

#### **Definition**

- Violence or threat of violence, AND
- Intent to commit theft/extortion OR to overcome resistance

#### **5 Essential Ingredients of Robbery**

**Base Element**: Must be theft OR extortion

**Theft** (Section 303 BNS):
- Dishonest taking of movable property
- Without consent
- With intention to take dishonestly

**Extortion** (Section 308 BNS):

**2️⃣ Use of Force or Threat of Injury**

**Requirement**: Voluntary causing or attempting to cause:

---

**3️⃣ Force Must Be Against Person**

- Force must be used **on the person** whose property is taken

---

**4️⃣ Force Used in Order to Commit Theft/Extortion**

**Two Scenarios**:

**(a) Force to commit theft/extortion**:
- Force used to facilitate taking of property
- Example: Hitting person and then taking wallet

**(b) Force to retain property after theft**:

- Example: Snatching purse, pushing victim who tries to stop

---

**5️⃣ Fear of Instant Harm**

**Timing**: Fear must be of **instant** (immediate) harm
- Not future harm
- Not delayed threat

**Degree**: Fear of:

---

#### **Formula for Robbery**

- Extortion + Threat of death = **ROBBERY**

### **Conclusion**

House breaking, robbery, and dacoity represent escalating degrees of offenses against property under BNS 2023. House breaking involves entering or exiting premises through six specified illegal ways. When house breaking is combined with theft or extortion, and force or threat is used, it becomes robbery. Robbery is fundamentally **theft or extortion plus violence or threat of violence**, requiring five essential elements including use of force on persons and fear of instant harm. When robbery is committed by five or more persons acting conjointly, it becomes dacoity, attracting even more serious punishment. The law distinguishes these offenses based on **manner of commission, number of offenders, and degree of violence**, ensuring proportionate punishment for varying levels of threat to person and property.
