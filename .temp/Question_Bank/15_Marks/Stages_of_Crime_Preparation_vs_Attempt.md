## ✅ MODEL ANSWER (SPPU STYLE)

### Introduction (1 mark)

A crime is not committed in an instant. It is the culmination of a **series of acts** which eventually result in the commission of an illegal act. The commission of every crime involves **FOUR distinct stages**, beginning with the mental conception of the offense and ending with its actual accomplishment. Understanding these stages is crucial in criminal law, as **punishability varies** at each stage - some stages are punishable, while others are not.

Under the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023, the law recognizes these stages and provides for punishment at specific stages, particularly **Attempt** (Section 62) and **Accomplishment** (various substantive offenses).

---

### FOUR Stages of Crime (6 marks)

The commission of a crime passes through **FOUR progressive stages**:

### 1️⃣ **INTENTION** (1.5 marks)

**Definition**: Intention is the **first stage** in the commission of an offense. It is the mental determination or resolution to commit a criminal act.

**Nature**:
- Purely **mental stage**
- Formation of criminal design in the mind
- No external manifestation
- Exists in the mind alone

**Legal Position - NOT Punishable**:
- Mere intention, **not followed by any act**, cannot constitute an offense
- The law does NOT take notice of mere intention alone
- **Maxim**: "Cogitationis poenam nemo patitur" (No one is punished for merely thinking)

**Rationale for Non-Punishment**:
- **Difficult to prove**: Very hard for prosecution to prove the guilty mind without overt act
- **No harm caused**: Thought alone causes no harm to society
- **Impossible to detect**: No way to know what someone is thinking
- **Room for repentance**: Person may change mind

**Example**:
- A decides in his mind to kill B
- Does nothing further
- Merely thinks about various ways to commit murder
- **Not punishable** - pure intention without action

**Illustration**:
If every person who ever thought of committing a crime were punished, prisons would overflow. The law wisely waits for some overt act before intervening.

---

### 2️⃣ **PREPARATION** (1.5 marks)

**Definition**: Preparation is the **second stage** in which the offender arranges the **necessary means and measures** for the commission of the intended criminal act.

**Nature**:
- Involves **external acts**
- Arranging means for commission
- Planning and getting ready
- Still **remote** from actual commission

**Legal Position - Generally NOT Punishable**:
- Intention followed by preparation is **not enough** to constitute crime
- Preparation has **not been made punishable** in most cases
- Difficult for prosecution to prove that preparations were for particular crime

**Rationale for Non-Punishment**:
- **Ambiguous intent**: Preparations could be for lawful or unlawful purpose
- **No direct harm**: No immediate danger to victim
- **Possibility of abandonment**: Person may still change mind
- **Difficult to prove**: Hard to establish that specific crime was intended

**Exceptions** (Where Preparation IS Punishable):
1. Preparation for **waging war** against Government of India
2. Preparation for **dacoity**
3. **Counterfeiting currency or stamps**
4. **Possessing counterfeit currency**
5. Other specific statutory provisions

**Examples of Preparation**:
- Buying a knife or weapon
- Watching victim's daily routine
- Studying layout of house to be burgled
- Making a plan or drawing map
- Collecting information about victim

**Illustration**:
- A purchases a gun and ammunition
- Studies B's daily schedule
- Notes when B is alone
- This is **PREPARATION** - not punishable (unless specific exception applies)

**Key Principle**: Preparation is the stage of **"getting ready"** to commit the crime, but **not yet trying** to commit it.

---

### 3️⃣ **ATTEMPT** (1.5 marks)

**Definition**: Attempt is the **direct movement** towards the commission of a crime **after the preparation is made**. It is an act done with intent to commit an offense, which forms part of a series of acts that would constitute the actual commission if not interrupted.

**Nature**:
- **Overt act** toward commission
- More than merely preparatory
- **Proximate** to actual commission
- Direct and immediate step

**Legal Position - PUNISHABLE**:
- Generally **punishable under Section 62 BNS**
- Person may be guilty even if actual commission is **impossible**
- Attempt is itself a crime, though lesser punishment than completed offense

**3 Essential Ingredients of Attempt**:

1️⃣ **Guilty Intention**
   - Must have intention to commit the offense
   - Mens rea (guilty mind) essential

2️⃣ **Act Towards Commission**
   - Must do **some act** towards commission
   - Act must be **more than mere preparation**
   - Must be a substantial step

3️⃣ **Falls Short of Completion**
   - Act must **fall short** of completed offense
   - If completed, it's accomplishment, not attempt
   - Interruption prevents completion

**Punishment**:
- **Section 62 BNS**: Punishable with up to **half** of the maximum punishment for the offense
- Where no express provision, half of imprisonment or fine

**Examples of Attempt**:
- A aims gun at B and pulls trigger, but gun misfires → **Attempt to murder**
- A puts hand in B's pocket to steal, but pocket empty → **Attempt to theft**
- A mixes poison in B's food, but B doesn't consume → **Attempt to murder**

**Illustration**:
- A (from preparation example) now goes to B's house with loaded gun
- Points gun at B
- Pulls trigger
- Gun jams and doesn't fire
- This is **ATTEMPT to murder** - **PUNISHABLE**

**📌 Important Case**: Abhayanand Mishra v. State of Bihar
- Accused applied to university with forged certificates
- Application sent to university
- University discovered fraud before exam
- **Held**: Crossed preparation stage; constituted **attempt to cheat**
- Preparation complete when application prepared; attempt when dispatched

---

### 4️⃣ **ACCOMPLISHMENT / COMPLETION** (1.5 marks)

**Definition**: Accomplishment is the **last and final stage** in the commission of an offense. The accused **succeeds** in his attempt and the crime is **fully completed**.

**Nature**:
- Crime actually committed
- All elements of offense present
- **Actus reus** (guilty act) + **Mens rea** (guilty mind) both present
- Harm caused

**Legal Position - FULLY Punishable**:
- Guilty of the **complete offense**
- **Full punishment** as prescribed for that offense
- No reduction in punishment

**Examples**:
- A fires at B intending to kill, B dies → **Murder** (accomplished)
- A takes B's property dishonestly → **Theft** (accomplished)
- A makes false document → **Forgery** (accomplished)

**Illustration**:
If A fires at B with intention to kill him:
- If B **dies** → A guilty of **MURDER** (accomplishment) - full punishment
- If B **only injured** → A guilty of **ATTEMPT to murder** - reduced punishment

**Principle**: Accomplishment is the successful execution of the criminal intent, resulting in the commission of the offense intended.

---

### CRITICAL DISTINCTION: Preparation vs Attempt (7 marks)

The most important and frequently examined aspect is the **distinction between Preparation and Attempt**. This distinction determines whether an act is punishable or not.

#### General Principle

**Preparation**: Devising or arranging means necessary for commission → **Generally NOT punishable**

**Attempt**: Direct movement with those means toward commission → **Punishable**

#### 5 Tests to Distinguish Preparation from Attempt

### 1️⃣ **PROXIMITY TEST** (1.5 marks)

**Principle**: How **close** is the act to the actual commission of the offense?

**Preparation**:
- Act is **remote** from the commission
- **Considerable distance** still exists between act and offense
- Several more steps required

**Attempt**:
- Act is **proximate** (close/near) to the commission
- Act is the **last step** before completion or very close to it
- Direct and immediate connection to offense

**Example**:
- Buying poison → **Preparation** (remote)
- Mixing poison in victim's food → **Attempt** (proximate)

**Illustration**:
- A buys match sticks and petrol to burn B's house → **Preparation**
- A pours petrol on B's house and lights matchstick → **Attempt**

---

### 2️⃣ **EQUIVOCALITY TEST / UNAMBIGUOUS INTENTION TEST** (1.5 marks)

**Principle**: Does the act **unequivocally show** criminal intention?

**Preparation**:
- Act is **equivocal** (ambiguous)
- Could be for **lawful or unlawful** purpose
- Criminal intent not clearly manifested

**Attempt**:
- Act is **unequivocal** (clear and unambiguous)
- **Clearly shows** criminal intention
- No other reasonable explanation

**Example**:
- A standing near bank with bag → **Equivocal** (could be customer or robber) - Preparation
- A enters bank with gun and demands money → **Unequivocal** (clearly robbery) - Attempt

**Illustration**:
- A purchases a dagger → **Equivocal** (could be for self-defense, collection, or murder) - Preparation
- A approaches B with dagger raised to strike → **Unequivocal** (clearly intends harm) - Attempt

---

### 3️⃣ **LOCUS POENITENTIAE TEST** (1.5 marks)

**Principle**: Does the person still have **opportunity to voluntarily desist**?

**Preparation**:
- Person has **locus poenitentiae** (place for repentance)
- Can still **change mind** and stop
- **Voluntarily withdraw** without intervention

**Attempt**:
- Person has **crossed point of no return**
- **Committed** to the course of action
- Cannot voluntarily withdraw; intervention needed

**Example**:
- A makes plan to kill B → Can abandon plan - **Preparation**
- A fires gun at B → Cannot take bullet back - **Attempt**

**Rationale**: Law gives opportunity for reformation until person crosses into attempt stage.

---

### 4️⃣ **OVERT ACT TEST** (1 mark)

**Principle**: Has a **substantial step** been taken toward commission?

**Preparation**:
- No **overt act** toward commission
- Only planning and arranging
- Preparatory acts only

**Attempt**:
- **Overt act** toward commission done
- Substantial step taken
- Directly connected to offense

**Example**:
- Planning route to victim's house → No overt act - **Preparation**
- Going to victim's house with weapon → Overt act - **Attempt**

---

### 5️⃣ **SERIES OF ACTS TEST** (1.5 marks)

**Principle**: Is the act part of the **series of acts** that would constitute the offense?

**Preparation**:
- Acts are **preparatory** to the series
- Not yet part of the criminal series
- Antecedent acts

**Attempt**:
- Acts are **part of the series** that would constitute the offense
- If continued uninterrupted, would result in completion
- Part of the execution phase

**Example**:
- Making plan, buying tools → Preparatory acts - **Preparation**
- Breaking lock, entering house → Part of burglary series - **Attempt**

---

#### Comparative Table: Preparation vs Attempt

| Aspect | Preparation | Attempt |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Definition** | Arranging means | Using means arranged |
| **Proximity** | Remote from crime | Proximate to crime |
| **Intent Clarity** | Equivocal | Unequivocal |
| **Locus Poenitentiae** | Can withdraw | Point of no return |
| **Overt Act** | No substantial step | Substantial step taken |
| **Punishability** | Generally NOT | YES (Section 62) |
| **Stage** | Getting ready | Trying to do |
| **Example** | Buying gun | Firing gun |

---

#### Practical Illustrations

**Illustration 1**: **Theft Case**
- A watches jewelry shop daily, notes security → **Preparation**
- A breaks shop lock at night → **Attempt**
- A takes jewelry and leaves → **Accomplishment**

**Illustration 2**: **Murder Case**
- A buys poison intending to kill B → **Preparation**
- A mixes poison in B's drink → **Attempt**
- B drinks and dies → **Accomplishment**

**Illustration 3**: **Exam Fraud Case** (from Abhayanand Mishra)
- A prepares forged certificates at home → **Preparation**
- A sends application to university → **Attempt** (crossed line)
- University accepts and A writes exam → **Accomplishment** (but discovered before this)

---

### Conclusion (1 mark)

The **four stages of crime** - Intention, Preparation, Attempt, and Accomplishment - represent the **progressive development** of criminal conduct from mere thought to completed offense. Understanding these stages is crucial because **punishability varies** at each stage.

While **Intention and Preparation are generally not punishable** (with specific exceptions), **Attempt becomes punishable** under Section 62 BNS as it represents a direct step toward commission of the offense. **Accomplishment** results in full punishment for the completed crime.

The **critical distinction between Preparation and Attempt** lies in tests of **proximity, equivocality, locus poenitentiae, overt act, and series of acts**. This distinction ensures that the law does not punish mere thoughts or ambiguous actions, but intervenes at the stage where a person has taken a definite, unambiguous step toward committing a crime, thereby **balancing individual liberty with social protection**.
