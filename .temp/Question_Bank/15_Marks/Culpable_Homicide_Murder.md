### **DISTINCTION BETWEEN CULPABLE HOMICIDE AND MURDER**

#### **Introduction**

The distinction between culpable homicide and murder is one of the most important and complex aspects of criminal law. Both offenses relate to causing death of a human being, but they differ in the degree of intention and knowledge required. Section 100 of the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023 (previously Section 299 IPC) defines Culpable Homicide, while Section 101 BNS (previously Section 300 IPC) defines Murder. As held by the Supreme Court in **Rampal Singh v. State of U.P.**, **"Culpable homicide is the genus and murder is the species"**. This means all murders are culpable homicides, but all culpable homicides are not murders.

### **I. CULPABLE HOMICIDE (Section 100 BNS)**

#### **Definition**

"Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide."

#### **Essential Elements**

**1️⃣ Physical Element (Actus Reus)**
- There must be causing of death of a human being
- Death must be the direct result of the accused's act
- The act must be of such nature that endangers human life

**2️⃣ Mental Element (Mens Rea) - Three Forms**

**Form A: Intention of Causing Death**
- The accused directly intends to cause death
- Example: A shoots B aiming at B's heart with intention to kill

**Form B: Intention of Causing Bodily Injury Likely to Cause Death**
- The accused intends to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death
- Example: A repeatedly beats B on head with iron rod knowing such injury likely to cause death

**Form C: Knowledge that Act is Likely to Cause Death**
- The accused has knowledge that the act will likely cause death, though may not intend it
- Example: A doctor knowingly uses infected syringe on patient, knowing it will likely cause death

---

### **II. MURDER (Section 101 BNS)**

#### **Definition and Relationship**

Section 101 states that **"Culpable homicide is murder"** in four specific situations. This establishes two fundamental principles:

1. For an act to be classified as murder, it must first satisfy all elements of culpable homicide
2. All murders are culpable homicides, but not all culpable homicides are murders

#### **4️⃣ Situations When Culpable Homicide is MURDER**

**1. Intention of Causing Death**

When the act is done with the **direct intention of causing death**.

The degree of intention must be very high - there must be positive intention to cause death, not merely harm or grievous hurt.

*Examples*: Shooting at vital organs, stabbing in heart, administering deadly poison

**2. Intention to Cause Bodily Injury Sufficient in Ordinary Course to Cause Death**

When the act is done with intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause death, and the bodily injury intended is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.

*Case Law*: **Virsa Singh v. State of Punjab** - Accused gave one spear blow that pierced through and ruptured liver and both kidneys. Held: Bodily injury sufficient in ordinary course to cause death = Murder.

**3. Intention to Cause Bodily Injury That Person is Likely to Die From**

When there is intention to cause bodily injury, and that bodily injury is likely to cause death of the person to whom harm is caused.

*Special knowledge cases*: Where offender has special knowledge about victim's condition (e.g., hemophilia) and causes injury that leads to death.

**4. Imminently Dangerous Act - Knowledge It Will Probably Cause Death**

When the person commits an act so **imminently dangerous** that it must in **all probability** cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and does such act **without any excuse** for incurring the risk.

*Case Law*: **State of A.P. v. R. Punnayya** - Accused set fire to inhabited hut in which persons were sleeping, causing three deaths. Held: Act imminently dangerous that must in all probability cause death = Murder.

### **III. 5️⃣ EXCEPTIONS: When Culpable Homicide Does NOT Amount to Murder**

Even though all conditions of murder are satisfied, the law recognizes five situations where the offense is reduced to culpable homicide not amounting to murder:

#### **Exception 1: Grave and Sudden Provocation**

**Provision**: Culpable homicide is not murder if offender, while deprived of self-control by **grave and sudden provocation**, causes death of person who gave provocation.

**Conditions**:
- Provocation must be **grave** (serious, not trivial)
- Provocation must be **sudden** (no time for premeditation)
- Must not be **self-invited** by accused

**Case Law**: **K.M. Nanavati v. State of Maharashtra**
- Naval officer discovered wife's affair, went to lover's flat and shot him
- Claimed grave and sudden provocation
- Held: **Conviction for Murder upheld** - Time gap between discovery and killing showed premeditation, not sudden passion
- **Principle**: For Exception 1, provocation must be sudden with no time for cooling down

#### **Exception 2: Private Defense Exceeded in Good Faith**

**Provision**: Culpable homicide is not murder if offender, in exercise in **good faith** of right of **private defense**, exceeds the power given by law.

**Conditions**:
- Must be exercising right of private defense
- Must act in good faith
- Must exceed the right without premeditation
- No intention to do more harm than necessary

**Illustration**: Z attempts to horsewhip A (not grievous hurt). A draws pistol. Z persists. A, believing in good faith he cannot prevent being horsewhipped by any other means, shoots Z dead. A has committed Culpable Homicide, not Murder.

#### **Exception 3: Public Servant Exceeding Powers**

**Provision**: Not murder if offender is **public servant** or person assisting public servant, acting in **good faith** for advancement of **public justice**, and exceeds powers given by law.

**Conditions**:
- Must be public servant or assisting public servant
- Acting for advancement of public justice
- Belief in good faith that act was lawful and necessary
- Exceeds powers given by law
- No ill-will toward person harmed

#### **Exception 4: Sudden Fight**

**Provision**: Not murder if committed **without premeditation** in a **sudden fight** in **heat of passion** upon sudden quarrel.

**Conditions**:
- No premeditation - not planned
- Sudden fight - quarrel arose suddenly
- Heat of passion - committed in heat of moment
- No undue advantage taken
- Not done in cruel or unusual manner

**Case Law**: **Darshan Singh v. State of Punjab** - Sudden quarrel, fight in heat of passion, accused stabbed deceased with knife without premeditation. Held: Exception 4 applicable - Culpable Homicide not Murder.

#### **Exception 5: Consent of Person Above 18 Years**

**Provision**: Not murder when person whose death is caused, being **above 18 years of age**, suffers death or takes risk of death with **own consent**.

**Conditions**:
- Deceased must be above 18 years of age
- Deceased gave consent to death or risk of death
- Consent must be voluntary

**Case Law**: **Surinder Kumar v. State of Haryana** - Lovers from different castes, families opposed, both consumed poison (suicide pact), girl died, boy survived. Held: Girl was above 18 and gave consent - Exception 5 applicable - Culpable Homicide not Murder.

**Important**: If person below 18 years, consent is invalid - it will be MURDER.

### **IV. DISTINCTION: Culpable Homicide vs Murder**

#### **Key Principle**

As held in **Kesar Singh v. State of Haryana**, the true distinction between culpable homicide and murder is **only a difference in DEGREES of intention and knowledge**.

- **Greater degree** of intention and knowledge → **MURDER**
- **Lesser degree** of intention and knowledge → **CULPABLE HOMICIDE**

#### **Comparative Table**

| **Aspect** | **Culpable Homicide** | **Murder** |
|------------|----------------------|------------|
| **Nature** | Genus (broader category) | Species (specific type) |
| **Intention** | Bodily injury **likely** to cause death | Bodily injury **sufficient in ordinary course** to cause death |
| **Knowledge** | Act **likely** to cause death | Act **must in all probability** cause death |
| **Degree of Probability** | Lesser degree - chance of escape | Higher degree - certain death |
| **Punishment** | Up to life or 10 years (Sec 105) | Death or life imprisonment (Sec 103) |

#### **Requirement of Intention**

**In Culpable Homicide**: Intention of causing bodily injury **likely** to result in death
- Court decides if injuries were likely to cause death
- Does not require person to know injuries will result in death

**In Murder**: Intention of causing bodily injury **sufficient in ordinary course** to cause death
- Higher degree of certainty required
- Person must know injury will cause death

#### **Requirement of Knowledge**

**In Culpable Homicide**: Knowledge that act is **likely** to cause death
- Lower degree of probability

**In Murder**: Knowledge that act is **so imminently dangerous** that it **must in all probability** cause death
- Higher degree of certainty

---

### **V. CONCLUSION**

The distinction between culpable homicide and murder is fundamental to criminal jurisprudence. While both involve causing death, the critical difference lies in the degree of intention and knowledge. Murder requires a higher degree of probability and certainty of death, while culpable homicide requires only likelihood of death. The five exceptions recognize situations where, despite satisfying conditions of murder, humanitarian considerations reduce the offense to culpable homicide. This distinction ensures proportionate punishment based on the gravity of the mental element involved.

As correctly summarized by the Supreme Court, **"Culpable homicide is the genus and murder is the species"** - all murders are culpable homicides, but the converse is not true. The law carefully balances the need for punishment with recognition of mitigating circumstances through the five exceptions.
