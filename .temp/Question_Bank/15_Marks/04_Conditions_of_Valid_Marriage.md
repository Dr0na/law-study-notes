### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

#### **INTRODUCTION**

The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 brought revolutionary changes to Hindu marriage law by codifying the essential conditions for a valid marriage. Section 5 of the Act prescribes seven mandatory conditions that must be fulfilled for a Hindu marriage to be valid. These conditions ensure that marriages are solemnized between consenting adults who are legally capable of entering into matrimony and are not related within prohibited degrees. Violation of these conditions renders the marriage either void or voidable under Sections 11 and 12 respectively.

#### **SECTION 5: CONDITIONS FOR A HINDU MARRIAGE**

Section 5 states: "A marriage may be solemnized between any two Hindus, if the following conditions are fulfilled, namely:—"

---

### **THE SEVEN ESSENTIAL CONDITIONS**

#### **CONDITION 1: NO LIVING SPOUSE [Section 5(i)]**

**Provision:**
"Neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage"

**Explanation:**
This condition mandates monogamy in Hindu marriage. At the time of marriage, both parties must be:
- Unmarried, OR
- If previously married, the prior marriage must have been dissolved by:
  - Death of former spouse
  - Divorce
  - Decree of nullity

**Consequence of Violation:**
Marriage is **VOID** under Section 11.

**Criminal Consequences:**
- IPC Section 494: Bigamy punishable with imprisonment up to 7 years and/or fine
- IPC Section 495: Bigamy with fraud punishable with imprisonment up to 10 years and fine

**Landmark Cases:**

1. **Sarla Mudgal v. Union of India (1995) 3 SCC 635:**
   - Hindu husband converted to Islam and married second wife without divorcing first wife
   - Supreme Court held: Conversion merely to contract second marriage is fraud on law
   - First marriage remains valid under Hindu Law
   - Second marriage is void

2. **Lily Thomas v. Union of India (2000) 6 SCC 224:**
   - Person remains Hindu for purposes of Hindu Marriage Act even after conversion if married under Hindu law
   - Cannot escape first marriage by conversion

**Illustration:**
A (male) marries B (female) in 2015. Without divorcing B, A marries C in 2020. The marriage between A and C is void under Section 11 as B is still living and the first marriage is subsisting.

**Exception:**
Custom may permit polygamy in exceptional cases, though this is extremely rare and courts are reluctant to recognize such customs in modern times.

---

#### **CONDITION 2: MENTAL CAPACITY [Section 5(ii)]**

**Provision:**
"Neither party—
(a) is incapable of giving a valid consent to it in consequence of unsoundness of mind; or
(b) though capable of giving valid consent, has been suffering from mental disorder of such a kind or to such an extent as to be unfit for marriage and the procreation of children; or
(c) has been subject to recurrent attacks of insanity"

**Three Sub-Conditions:**

**2(a): Incapacity to Give Valid Consent**
- Party must be capable of understanding the nature of marriage
- Must comprehend duties and responsibilities
- Must understand consequences of entering matrimony

Examples of incapacity:
- Severe mental illness preventing comprehension
- Intellectual disability
- Unsoundness of mind at time of marriage

**2(b): Mental Disorder Making Party Unfit**
- Party has mental disorder
- Disorder makes party unfit for BOTH:
  - Marriage, AND
  - Procreation of children
- Both conditions must be satisfied

**2(c): Recurrent Attacks of Insanity**
- Party has suffered recurrent attacks of insanity
- Pattern of repeated episodes
- Must be established medically

**Consequence of Violation:**
Marriage is **VOIDABLE** at option of other party under Section 12(1)(b).

**Proof Required:**
Medical evidence is essential to establish mental incapacity.

**Case Law:**

**Lila Gupta v. Laxmi Narain (AIR 1978 Del 32):**
- Medical evidence essential to prove recurrent insanity
- Mere eccentric behavior insufficient
- Pattern of insanity must be clearly established

**Illustration:**
A marries B. After marriage, A discovers that B suffers from schizophrenia making B unfit for marriage and procreation. A can seek decree of nullity under Section 12(1)(b).

---

#### **CONDITION 3: AGE REQUIREMENT [Section 5(iii)]**

**Provision:**
"The bridegroom has completed the age of twenty-one years and the bride, the age of eighteen years at the time of marriage"

**Age Requirements:**
- **Bridegroom (male):** Must have completed 21 years
- **Bride (female):** Must have completed 18 years

**Note:** Recent proposals aim to increase bride's age to 21 years to ensure parity.

**Consequence of Violation:**
Marriage is **VOIDABLE** under Section 12(1)(c).

**Who Can Challenge:**
Only the minor party can seek annulment.

**Time Limit:**
Within 2 years of attaining majority age.

**Additional Legal Framework:**

**Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006:**
- Child marriage is voidable at option of contracting party who was child
- Can be annulled before attaining majority
- Within 2 years after attaining majority

**Penal Provisions:**
Under Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006:
- Male adult above 18 marrying minor: 2 years imprisonment and/or fine up to ₹1 lakh
- Person performing/conducting child marriage: 2 years imprisonment and/or fine up to ₹1 lakh

**Proof of Age:**
- Birth certificate
- School leaving certificate
- Passport
- Medical examination (ossification test) if documents unavailable

**Case Law:**

**Jitendra Kumar v. State of Haryana (2012) 11 SCC 493:**
- Penal provisions under Prohibition of Child Marriage Act are in addition to Hindu Marriage Act provisions
- Separate prosecution possible

**Illustration:**
A (male, 20 years) marries B (female, 17 years). Marriage is voidable. B can seek annulment within 2 years of turning 18 (before turning 20).

---

#### **CONDITION 4: NO SAPINDA RELATIONSHIP [Section 5(iv)]**

**Provision:**
"The parties are not sapindas of each other, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two"

**Definition of Sapinda [Section 3(f)]:**
Two persons are sapindas of each other if one is lineal ascendant of other within:
- **3 degrees** through father
- **5 degrees** through mother

**How to Calculate Degrees:**
Exclude the first generation, then count upward.

**Example (Father's Line):**
```
Self → Father (excluded) → Grandfather (1) → Great-grandfather (2) → Great-great-grandfather (3)
= 3 degrees through father
```

**Example (Mother's Line):**
```
Self → Mother (excluded) → Maternal Grandfather (1) → Mat. GGF (2) → Mat. GGGF (3) → Mat. GGGGF (4) → Mat. GGGGGF (5)
= 5 degrees through mother
```

**Prohibited Sapinda Relationships:**

**Through Father (within 3 degrees):**
- Self and father's sister (paternal aunt)
- Self and father's mother (grandmother)
- Self and father's father's sister
- Self and father's mother's sister

**Through Mother (within 5 degrees):**
- Self and mother's sister (maternal aunt)
- Self and mother's mother (grandmother)
- Self and any female ascendant within 5 degrees on mother's side

**Consequence of Violation:**
Marriage is **VOID** under Section 11.

**Exception - Custom:**
"Unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two"

**Application:**
- In South India, cross-cousin marriages are customary
- Marriage with mother's brother's daughter permitted by custom
- Custom must be proved

**Burden of Proof:**
Party claiming benefit of custom must prove:
- Custom exists
- Custom applies to both parties
- Custom is valid

**Case Law:**

**Madhavrao v. Raghavendrarao (AIR 1946 SC 33):**
- Sapinda relationship calculated strictly according to Section 3(f)
- Marriage within prohibited degrees is void

**Veerappa Setty v. Veeramma (AIR 1955 Mad 291):**
- Custom permitting marriage within sapinda degree must be strictly proved
- Burden on party claiming custom

**Illustration:**
A (male) wants to marry his father's sister (paternal aunt). This is within sapinda relationship (within 3 degrees through father). Marriage is void unless custom permits.

---

#### **CONDITION 5: NO PROHIBITED RELATIONSHIP [Section 5(v) + Schedule I]**

**Provision:**
"The parties are not within the degrees of prohibited relationship unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two"

**Schedule I - Prohibited Relationships:**

Schedule I lists specific relationships within which marriage is absolutely prohibited.

**For Males - Cannot Marry:**
- Mother, daughter, sister
- Father's sister, mother's sister
- Sister's daughter, brother's daughter
- Father's brother's daughter, mother's brother's daughter
- Father's sister's daughter, mother's sister's daughter

**For Females - Cannot Marry:**
- Father, son, brother
- Father's brother, mother's brother
- Sister's son, brother's son
- Father's brother's son, mother's brother's son
- Father's sister's son, mother's sister's son

**Note:** Relationships through adoption also included.

**Consequence of Violation:**
Marriage is **VOID** under Section 11.

**Exception:**
Custom may permit (rarely applies in practice).

**Difference: Sapinda vs Prohibited Relationship**

| **Aspect** | **Sapinda** | **Prohibited** |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Definition | By degrees (3/5) | Listed in Schedule I |
| Scope | Lineal ascendants | Includes collaterals |
| Source | Religious concept | Legal specification |

**Illustration:**
A (male) wants to marry his sister B. This is prohibited relationship under Schedule I. Marriage is absolutely void.

---

#### **CONDITION 6 & 7: CEREMONIES AND CUSTOMS [Section 7]**

While Section 5 lists substantive conditions, **Section 7** prescribes procedural requirements.

**Section 7: Ceremonies of a Hindu marriage**

**Text:**
"(1) A Hindu marriage may be solemnized in accordance with the customary rites and ceremonies of either party thereto.

(2) Where such rites and ceremonies include the Saptapadi (that is, the taking of seven steps by the bridegroom and the bride jointly before the sacred fire), the marriage becomes complete and binding when the seventh step is taken."

**Two Requirements:**

**1. Customary Rites and Ceremonies:**
- Marriage must be solemnized according to customary rites
- Custom of either party sufficient
- No particular form mandatory

**2. Saptapadi (Seven Steps):**
If ceremony includes Saptapadi:
- Marriage complete when 7th step taken
- Before 7th step, marriage not complete
- Sacred fire (Agni) as witness

**The Seven Vows (Saptapadi):**

Each step represents a vow:
1. Nourishment and food
2. Strength and vitality
3. Prosperity and wealth
4. Happiness and harmony
5. Progeny and children
6. Longevity and seasons
7. Friendship and companionship

**Consequence of Non-Performance:**
If essential ceremonies not performed: Marriage may be **VOID** (question of fact whether ceremony essential to custom).

**Case Law:**

**Chhaganlal Govindlal v. Municipal Corporation of Delhi (AIR 1964 SC 1411):**
- Saptapadi is completion point of marriage where it is part of ceremony

**Smt. Shanti v. Ram Kishan (AIR 1984 Raj 59):**
- If Saptapadi not performed and it is essential custom, marriage void

---

### **SECTION 16: LEGITIMACY OF CHILDREN**

Despite marriage being void or voidable, children born of such marriages are legitimate under Section 16 if:
- Marriage was null or annulled, AND
- Child conceived before decree of nullity, AND
- At time of intercourse, parties did not know facts making marriage void (or in voidable marriages, before decree)

**Rights of Children:**

- Succession to parents' property
- **Limitation:** Rights only to parents' property, not other relatives

---

### **MODERN POSITION AND REFORMS**

**Recent Developments:**

1. **Proposal to Increase Bride's Age:**
   - Legislative proposals to increase minimum age to 21 years
   - Ensure educational and career opportunities
   - Gender parity

2. **Stricter Enforcement:**
   - Child Marriage Prohibition Officers appointed
   - Stronger penal provisions
   - Public awareness campaigns

3. **Registration Emphasis:**
   - Many states making registration mandatory
   - Serves as proof of age and consent
   - Prevents fraudulent marriages

---

#### **CONCLUSION**

Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, along with Section 7, establishes a comprehensive framework of conditions for a valid Hindu marriage. These seven conditions balance traditional Hindu law principles with modern requirements of consent, capacity, and social acceptability. The classification of violations into void and voidable categories ensures that serious violations (bigamy, incest) result in absolute nullity, while violations concerning personal capacity (mental health, age) allow the affected party to decide whether to continue or annul the marriage.

The Act's provisions, supplemented by landmark judicial pronouncements, have successfully prevented forced marriages, child marriages, and bigamy, while respecting customary practices. The legitimacy granted to children under Section 16, even when marriages are void or voidable, reflects the humanitarian approach of the legislation in protecting innocent children from the consequences of their parents' invalid marriages.

As Hindu marriage law continues to evolve through amendments and judicial interpretation, these essential conditions remain the cornerstone of valid Hindu marriages, ensuring that marriages are entered into by consenting adults who are legally capable and not related within prohibited degrees, thereby upholding both individual rights and social welfare.

## ❓ QUESTION 2

**Q2-CVM-15M:** Explain the concept of "sapinda relationship" and "prohibited relationship" under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. How do these concepts safeguard against consanguineous marriages?

### **🔗 Cross References:**
Same as Q1

### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

#### **INTRODUCTION**

The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 prohibits marriages between persons who are related to each other within certain degrees of relationship. These prohibitions are based on two concepts: sapinda relationship (Section 3(f) and 5(iv)) and prohibited relationship (Section 5(v) and Schedule I). These provisions safeguard against consanguineous (blood-related) marriages, which may lead to genetic disorders, and maintain social and moral norms regarding family relationships.

---

#### **PART I: SAPINDA RELATIONSHIP**

### **A. DEFINITION [Section 3(f)]**

Section 3(f) defines sapinda relationship:

"Two persons are said to be 'sapindas' of each other if one is a lineal ascendant of the other within the limits of sapinda relationship, or if they have a common lineal ascendant who is within the limits of sapinda relationship with reference to each of them."

**Limits:**
- **Through father:** 3 degrees (excluding first generation)
- **Through mother:** 5 degrees (excluding first generation)

### **B. ORIGIN AND MEANING**

**Sanskrit Origin:**
"Sapinda" literally means "connected by particles of the same body" or "having common pinda."

**Religious Significance:**
- In Hindu tradition, pinda (rice balls) are offered during funeral ceremonies (shraddha)
- Persons who offer pinda to the same ancestor are sapindas
- Traditionally, sapindas participate in funeral rites

**Through Father (Paternal Line):**
Within 3 degrees means up to:
- Father's father (grandfather) - 1st degree
- Father's father's father (great-grandfather) - 2nd degree
- Father's father's father's father - 3rd degree

**Through Mother (Maternal Line):**
Within 5 degrees means up to:
- Mother's father (maternal grandfather) - 1st degree
- Mother's father's father - 2nd degree
- Mother's father's father's father - 3rd degree
- Mother's father's father's father's father - 4th degree
- Mother's father's father's father's father's father - 5th degree

### **C. HOW TO CALCULATE SAPINDA DEGREES**

**Rule:**
1. Exclude the first generation (the person himself/herself and their father/mother)
2. Count upward to determine degrees

**Example 1 - Father's Line:**
```
Counting sapinda degrees for person A:

A (Self) 
↓
Father (EXCLUDED)
↓
Grandfather (1st degree)
↓
Great-grandfather (2nd degree)
↓
Great-great-grandfather (3rd degree)
```

A and his great-great-grandfather are sapindas within 3 degrees through father.

**Example 2 - Mother's Line:**
```
A (Self)
↓
Mother (EXCLUDED)
↓
Maternal Grandfather (1st degree)
↓
Mat. Great-grandfather (2nd degree)
↓
Mat. GG-grandfather (3rd degree)
↓
Mat. GGG-grandfather (4th degree)
↓
Mat. GGGG-grandfather (5th degree)
```

### **D. PRACTICAL APPLICATION**

**Prohibited Sapinda Marriages:**

A person cannot marry:

**Through Father (3 degrees):**
- Father's sister (paternal aunt) - within 3 degrees
- Father's mother (grandmother) - within 3 degrees
- Father's father's sister
- Any female ascendant within 3 degrees on paternal side

**Through Mother (5 degrees):**
- Mother's sister (maternal aunt) - within 5 degrees
- Mother's mother (grandmother) - within 5 degrees
- Any female ascendant within 5 degrees on maternal side

**Illustration:**
Ramesh cannot marry:
- His paternal aunt (father's sister) - sapinda through father
- His maternal aunt (mother's sister) - sapinda through mother
- His grandmother (either side) - sapinda relationship

### **E. EXCEPTION - CUSTOM**

**Section 5(iv) Proviso:**
"unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two"

**Custom May Permit:**
If a valid custom exists, marriages within sapinda relationship may be permissible.

**Example:**
In many South Indian communities, cross-cousin marriages (marriage with mother's brother's daughter or father's sister's daughter) are permitted by custom, though these would otherwise fall within sapinda prohibitions.

**Requirements for Valid Custom:**
1. Custom must be ancient and continuous
2. Must apply to both parties
3. Must be proved in court
4. Burden of proof on party claiming custom

**Case Law:**

**Madhavrao v. Raghavendrarao (AIR 1946 SC 33):**
- Sapinda relationship must be calculated strictly as per Section 3(f)
- Marriage within prohibited degrees void unless custom saves it

**Veerappa Setty v. Veeramma (AIR 1955 Mad 291):**
- Custom permitting sapinda marriage must be strictly established
- Burden on party claiming benefit of custom

### **F. CONSEQUENCE OF VIOLATION**

**Legal Effect:**
Marriage within sapinda relationship is **VOID AB INITIO** under Section 11.

**Implications:**
- No legal existence
- Cannot be validated
- Children legitimate under Section 16 (with conditions)
- No need for formal decree (but advisable)

---

#### **PART II: PROHIBITED RELATIONSHIP**

### **A. DEFINITION [Section 5(v) and Schedule I]**

Section 5(v) states that parties to marriage must not be within degrees of prohibited relationship as specified in **Schedule I** to the Act.

**Schedule I** lists specific blood relationships and adopted relationships within which marriage is absolutely prohibited.

### **B. SCHEDULE I: PROHIBITED RELATIONSHIPS**

**For a Male - Cannot Marry:**

**Direct Lineage:**
- Mother
- Daughter
- Grandmother
- Granddaughter

**Collateral Relations:**
- Sister (full, half, or uterine)
- Father's sister (paternal aunt)
- Mother's sister (maternal aunt)
- Brother's daughter (niece)
- Sister's daughter (niece)
- Father's brother's daughter (cousin)
- Father's sister's daughter (cousin)
- Mother's brother's daughter (cousin)
- Mother's sister's daughter (cousin)
- Son's daughter (granddaughter)
- Daughter's daughter (granddaughter)

**For a Female - Cannot Marry:**

**Direct Lineage:**
- Father
- Son
- Grandfather
- Grandson

**Collateral Relations:**
- Brother (full, half, or uterine)
- Father's brother (paternal uncle)
- Mother's brother (maternal uncle)
- Sister's son (nephew)
- Brother's son (nephew)
- Father's brother's son (cousin)
- Father's sister's son (cousin)
- Mother's brother's son (cousin)
- Mother's sister's son (cousin)
- Son's son (grandson)
- Daughter's son (grandson)

**Adoption:**
All relationships established through valid adoption are treated as blood relationships for purposes of prohibited relationships.

### **C. RATIONALE**

**Why These Relationships are Prohibited:**

1. **Genetic Reasons:**
   - Consanguineous marriages increase risk of genetic disorders
   - Recessive genes from common ancestors

2. **Social and Moral Reasons:**
   - Maintaining sanctity of family relationships
   - Preventing exploitation within family
   - Cultural and ethical norms

3. **Religious Basis:**
   - Ancient Hindu texts prohibited incestuous relationships
   - Dharmashastra principles

### **D. EXCEPTION - CUSTOM**

Similar to sapinda relationships, Section 5(v) contains a saving clause:
"unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two"

However, custom permitting prohibited relationship marriages is extremely rare and difficult to establish.

### **E. CONSEQUENCE OF VIOLATION**

**Legal Effect:**
Marriage within prohibited relationship is **VOID AB INITIO** under Section 11.

**Criminal Implications:**
While Hindu Marriage Act makes such marriages void, there may be additional social and moral censure, though generally no separate criminal liability (unlike bigamy).

---

#### **PART III: DISTINCTION BETWEEN SAPINDA AND PROHIBITED RELATIONSHIP**

### **COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS:**

| **Aspect** | **Sapinda Relationship** | **Prohibited Relationship** |
|-----------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Definition** | Defined by degrees (3/5) | Listed in Schedule I |
| **Basis** | Lineal ascendants/descendants | Specific blood/adoptive relations |
| **Calculation** | Mathematical (count degrees) | Enumerated list |
| **Origin** | Religious concept (pinda offering) | Social and genetic considerations |
| **Scope** | Primarily lineal | Includes collaterals |
| **Custom** | Can override in some cases | Rarely overrides |
| **Purpose** | Prevent marriage with ancestors | Prevent incestuous marriages |

### **Overlap:**
Many relationships prohibited under sapinda are also in Schedule I. Schedule I is more comprehensive and specific.

---

#### **PART IV: SAFEGUARDS AGAINST CONSANGUINEOUS MARRIAGES**

### **A. GENETIC SAFEGUARDS**

**Why Consanguineous Marriages are Problematic:**

1. **Genetic Disorders:**
   - Increased probability of recessive genetic diseases
   - Autosomal recessive conditions manifest
   - Examples: Hemophilia, Thalassemia, certain metabolic disorders

2. **Reduced Genetic Diversity:**
   - Limited gene pool
   - Reduced hybrid vigor
   - Potential for accumulation of deleterious genes

**How These Provisions Help:**
- 3-degree paternal and 5-degree maternal limit ensures sufficient genetic distance
- Prohibits marriages between close blood relatives
- Reduces risk of genetic abnormalities in offspring

### **B. SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS**

**Preventing Family Disruption:**
- Maintains clear family roles and relationships
- Prevents confusion in family hierarchy
- Protects vulnerable family members from exploitation

**Maintaining Social Order:**
- Upholds cultural and moral values
- Prevents breakdown of family structure
- Ensures respect for familial bonds

### **C. LEGAL SAFEGUARDS**

**Void Nature of Marriages:**
- Strong deterrent effect
- No legal recognition whatsoever
- Cannot be validated or ratified

**Protection of Children:**
- Section 16 legitimizes children despite void marriage
- Ensures children are not penalized
- Right to maintenance and succession to parents' property

### **D. MODERN SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE**

**Genetic Counseling:**
While Act doesn't explicitly require it, modern practice includes:
- Pre-marital genetic counseling in some communities
- Awareness about risks of consanguineous marriages
- Medical advice on family planning

**Research Support:**
Studies show:
- Increased incidence of recessive disorders in consanguineous marriages
- Higher infant mortality rates
- Greater risk of congenital abnormalities

---

#### **PART V: JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION**

### **IMPORTANT CASES:**

**1. Madhavrao v. Raghavendrarao (AIR 1946 SC 33):**
- Established strict interpretation of sapinda calculation
- Degrees must be counted as per Section 3(f)

**2. Veerappa Setty v. Veeramma (AIR 1955 Mad 291):**
- Custom must be strictly proved
- Not easy to establish custom permitting prohibited marriages

**3. Mayne's Hindu Law and Usage:**
Courts frequently refer to this authoritative text for understanding sapinda relationships and their calculation.

---

#### **PART VI: PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS**

### **A. Registration Requirements**

Most states now require:
- Declaration of non-relationship
- Affidavit stating parties not within prohibited degrees
- Prevents fraudulent or invalid marriages

### **B. Burden of Proof**

- If marriage challenged, burden to prove violation on challenger
- If custom claimed, burden on party claiming custom
- Medical/genealogical evidence may be required

### **C. Regional Variations**

**South India:**
- Cross-cousin marriages traditionally accepted
- Custom well-established
- Courts generally recognize such customs

**North India:**
- Stricter application of sapinda rules
- Less acceptance of marriages within prohibited degrees
- Custom rarely invoked

---

#### **CONCLUSION**

The concepts of sapinda relationship and prohibited relationship under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 serve as crucial safeguards against consanguineous marriages. The sapinda system, based on Hindu religious traditions, establishes a mathematical framework (3 and 5 degrees) to prevent marriages between close blood relatives. Schedule I's enumeration of prohibited relationships provides additional, specific protection against incestuous marriages.

These provisions serve multiple purposes: they prevent genetic disorders that result from consanguineous unions, maintain social and family structures, and uphold moral and ethical values. The void nature of such marriages, combined with the legitimacy granted to children under Section 16, strikes a balance between deterring invalid marriages and protecting innocent offspring.

While custom provides limited exceptions, the burden of proof is high, ensuring that only genuine, long-standing customary practices can override these prohibitions. As medical science advances our understanding of genetics, these traditional Hindu law provisions find validation in modern genetic principles, proving the wisdom of ancient lawmakers.

The judiciary's strict interpretation of these provisions, combined with increasing awareness through registration requirements and genetic counseling, ensures that these safeguards effectively prevent consanguineous marriages while respecting genuine customs. These provisions remain relevant and necessary in modern Indian society, protecting both individual health and social welfare.
