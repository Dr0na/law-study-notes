### **DEFAMATION**

#### **Introduction**

Defamation is an offense against reputation under the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023, defined in **Section 356 BNS** (previously Section 499 IPC). It recognizes that **reputation** is a valuable asset and protects individuals against false imputations that harm their reputation. Defamation can be both a **civil wrong** (tort) and a **criminal offense**, with the criminal law addressing more serious cases where public interest demands prosecution. The law carefully balances **protection of reputation** with **freedom of speech**, providing ten specific exceptions where statements that might otherwise be defamatory are not punishable.

---

### **I. DEFINITION (Section 356 BNS)**

**"Whoever, by words either spoken or written, or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise, makes or publishes any imputation concerning any person intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm, the reputation of such person, is said, except in cases hereinafter excepted, to defame that person."**

**Identification**:

### **Conclusion**

Defamation under Section 356 BNS protects individuals' reputation while balancing freedom of speech through ten carefully crafted exceptions. The offense requires imputation concerning a person with intent to harm or knowledge that it will harm reputation, made through various forms of communication. The ten exceptions ensure that genuine public interest disclosures, fair opinions on public matters, court reports, and good faith communications are not stifled, thus maintaining equilibrium between individual reputation rights and societal need for free expression. The distinction between criminal and civil defamation reflects that while reputation is valuable, not every defamatory statement warrants criminal prosecution - only those affecting public interest or particularly serious in nature. Understanding these exceptions is crucial as they define the boundaries of permissible speech while protecting against malicious attacks on reputation.
