# 📝 QUESTION BANK: DEFINITIONS & CONCEPTS (2 Marks)

## 🎯 SECTION A: SOURCES & SCHOOLS

### **Q1: Define Shruti.**

**ANSWER:**
Shruti means "that which is heard" and refers to the most sacred and authoritative texts in Hindu tradition - the four Vedas (Rig, Yajur, Sama, Atharva). Considered divine revelation, Shruti has the highest religious authority but limited direct legal content. It establishes foundational principles of dharma (righteousness) which form the philosophical basis of Hindu Law. Though not directly applied in modern courts, Shruti influences interpretation of Hindu legal principles.

### **Q2: Define Smriti.**

**ANSWER:**
Smriti means "that which is remembered" and represents human interpretation and codification of Vedic principles. The major Smritis include Manu Smriti (most authoritative), Yajnavalkya, Narada, Parasara, and others. Smritis contain detailed legal rules on marriage, inheritance, adoption, and civil-criminal procedures. While secondary to Shruti in religious authority, Smritis have been extensively used in legal practice and formed the basis for later commentaries that created different schools of Hindu Law.

### **Q3: What is custom (Achara) as a source of Hindu Law?**

### **Q5: What is Mitakshara School?**

**ANSWER:**
Mitakshara is one of two major schools of Hindu Law, created by Vijnaneshwara's 11th-century commentary on Yajnavalkya Smriti. It applies to most of India except Bengal and Assam. Key principles include: (1) Birthright - son acquires interest by birth in ancestral property, (2) Survivorship - share passes by survivorship not succession, (3) Coparcenary within 4 degrees. It has five sub-schools: Benaras, Mithila, Bombay, Dravida, and Punjab. The 2005 Amendment made daughters coparceners equal to sons in Mitakshara coparcenary.

---

### **Q6: What is Dayabhaga School?**

**ANSWER:**
Dayabhaga School, created by Jimutavahana's 12th-century treatise, applies to Bengal and Assam. It fundamentally differs from Mitakshara by rejecting birthright concept. Key principles: (1) No birthright - sons inherit only after father's death, (2) Father has absolute power over property, (3) Succession not survivorship - property passes by inheritance, (4) Sapinda relationship defined by 7 degrees (father) and 5 degrees (mother). Hindu Succession Act, 1956 unified succession rules but coparcenary distinctions remain relevant.

**[170 words]**

---

### **Q7: What is coparcenary under Mitakshara School?**

**ANSWER:**
Coparcenary under Mitakshara School is a narrower body than joint family, consisting of persons who acquire by birth an interest in ancestral property. Classically, it included only males within four degrees from a common ancestor. Key features: (1) Interest by birth, (2) Community of interest, (3) Unity of possession, (4) Survivorship applies. Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 made daughters coparceners equal to sons from birth. Example: Father, son, grandson, great-grandson form coparcenary. **Case: Vineeta Sharma v. Rakesh Sharma (2020)** clarified daughter's coparcenary rights retrospectively.
