## ❓ QUESTION 1

**Q1-SRC-5M:** Explain custom as a source of Hindu Law. What are the essential conditions for a valid custom?

### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

**INTRODUCTION:**
Custom (Achara) is one of the ancient sources of Hindu Law and has significant legal recognition. Section 3(a) of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 recognizes custom and usage as part of Hindu Law.

**DEFINITION:**
Custom refers to practices and usages that have been continuously and uniformly observed by a particular community, family, or locality and are considered legally binding.

**TYPES OF CUSTOM:**
1. **Local Custom:** Confined to particular locality
2. **Family Custom:** Peculiar to particular family
3. **Class/Caste Custom:** Applicable to particular caste/community

**SIX ESSENTIAL CONDITIONS FOR VALID CUSTOM:**

**Mnemonic: "ACRCU-R"**

1. **Antiquity:** Must be ancient and immemorial (long-standing)
2. **Certainty:** Must be clear, definite, and ascertainable
3. **Reasonableness:** Not opposed to public policy, morality, or statute
4. **Continuity:** Continuously observed without interruption
5. **Uniformity:** Uniformly followed by community
6. **Recognition:** Recognized by community as binding obligation

**BURDEN OF PROOF:**
Party claiming benefit of custom must prove its existence and validity.

**CASE LAW:**
**Collector of Madura v. Moottoo Ramalinga (1868):** Privy Council held custom must be proved as fact; burden on party claiming custom.

**LEGAL POSITION:**
Valid custom can override written texts. Section 5(iv) and 5(v) of HMA allow custom to save marriages within sapinda/prohibited relationships.

**CONCLUSION:**
Custom remains a vital source of Hindu Law, especially in matters of marriage ceremonies and certain regional practices, provided it satisfies the six essential conditions.

## ❓ QUESTION 2

**Q2-SRC-5M:** Write a note on Shruti and Smriti as sources of Hindu Law.

### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

**SHRUTI (श्रुति):**

**Meaning:** "That which is heard" - Divine revelation.

**Components:** Four Vedas - Rig, Yajur, Sama, Atharva

**Authority:** Highest religious authority; considered divine and infallible.

**Legal Significance:**
- Limited direct legal content
- Establishes foundational principles of dharma
- Not directly applied in courts today
- Influences interpretation of Hindu Law

**SMRITI (स्मृति):**

**Meaning:** "That which is remembered" - Human interpretation of Vedic principles.

**Major Smritis:**
1. **Manu Smriti** (Most authoritative)
2. Yajnavalkya Smriti
3. Narada, Parasara, Vishnu Smriti
4. Gautama, Apastamba, Vasistha Smriti

**Legal Content:**
- Detailed rules on marriage, inheritance, adoption
- Criminal and civil procedures
- Rights and duties of individuals
- Practical legal guidance

**Authority:** Secondary to Shruti but extensively used in practice.

**DISTINCTION:**

| **Aspect** | **Shruti** | **Smriti** |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Origin | Divine | Human |
| Authority | Highest | Secondary |
| Content | Principles | Detailed rules |
| Application | Philosophical | Practical |

**MODERN RELEVANCE:**
Both sources now largely superseded by legislation (Hindu Code Acts), but continue to provide interpretative guidance.

**CONCLUSION:**
Shruti and Smriti represent foundation and practical codification of Hindu Law respectively. While Shruti provided divine principles, Smriti translated them into workable legal rules, together forming the classical basis of Hindu Law.

## ❓ QUESTION 3

**Q3-SCH-5M:** Explain the Mitakshara School of Hindu Law.

### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

**INTRODUCTION:**
Mitakshara is one of the two major schools of Hindu Law, applicable to most of India except Bengal and Assam.

**BASIC INFORMATION:**

**Author:** Vijnaneshwara (11th Century CE)
**Text:** Commentary on Yajnavalkya Smriti
**Meaning:** "Measured in words" or "Brief commentary"
**Area:** Most of India (except Bengal, Assam)

**FIVE SUB-SCHOOLS:**

**Mnemonic: "BMBD-P"**
1. **Benaras** (UP, North India)
2. **Mithila** (Bihar)
3. **Bombay** (Maharashtra, Gujarat) - Vyavahara Mayukha
4. **Dravida/Madras** (South India) - Smriti Chandrika
5. **Punjab** (Punjab, Haryana)

**KEY PRINCIPLES:**

**1. Coparcenary:**
- Narrower body than joint family
- Males within 4 degrees from common ancestor
- 2005 Amendment: Daughters also coparceners

**2. Birth Right:**
Son acquires interest **by birth** in ancestral property.

**3. Survivorship:**
On coparcener's death, share passes by **survivorship** to surviving coparceners (not by succession).

**4. Joint Family Property:**
- Ancestral property: All coparceners have birthright
- Self-acquired: Individual's separate property

**5. Partition:**
Any coparcener can demand partition as right.

**MODERN IMPACT:**
Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 made daughters coparceners equal to sons, significantly impacting Mitakshara principles.

**CASE LAW:**
**Vineeta Sharma v. Rakesh Sharma (2020):** Clarified daughter's coparcenary rights retrospectively.

**CONCLUSION:**
Mitakshara School's concepts of birthright, coparcenary, and survivorship fundamentally shaped Hindu inheritance law, though statutory reforms have modified classical principles to ensure gender equality.

## ❓ QUESTION 4

**Q4-SCH-5M:** Write a short note on Dayabhaga School of Hindu Law.

### **📋 MODEL ANSWER:**

**INTRODUCTION:**
Dayabhaga is the second major school of Hindu Law, applicable in Bengal and Assam regions.

**BASIC INFORMATION:**

**Author:** Jimutavahana (12th Century CE)
**Text:** Original treatise (not commentary)
**Meaning:** "Division of Inheritance"
**Area:** Bengal (West Bengal) and Assam

**FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE:**
Rejects Mitakshara's doctrine of birthright and survivorship.

**KEY PRINCIPLES:**

**1. NO BIRTH RIGHT:**
- Sons do NOT acquire interest by birth
- Father has absolute ownership during lifetime
- Sons inherit only after father's death

**2. SUCCESSION, NOT SURVIVORSHIP:**
- Property passes by succession (inheritance) upon death
- Not by survivorship
- Heirs take according to succession rules

**3. SAPINDA RELATIONSHIP:**
- Through father: Up to **7 degrees**
- Through mother: Up to **5 degrees**
- Determines inheritance and marriage prohibitions

**4. FATHER'S ABSOLUTE POWER:**
- Can alienate property freely
- No need for son's consent
- Sons have no present interest (only expectancy)

**5. BETTER POSITION FOR WIDOWS:**
- Widow inherits equal to son
- Better rights than in classical Mitakshara

**COMPARISON WITH MITAKSHARA:**

| **Aspect** | **Mitakshara** | **Dayabhaga** |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Birth Right | Yes | No |
| Succession | Survivorship | Succession |
| Father's Power | Limited | Absolute |
| Area | Most of India | Bengal, Assam |

**MODERN POSITION:**
Hindu Succession Act, 1956 unified succession rules, reducing practical distinctions. However, coparcenary concepts still differ.

**CONCLUSION:**
Dayabhaga School's rejection of birthright and adoption of succession principles distinguished it fundamentally from Mitakshara, though modern legislation has reduced practical differences between the two schools.
