### **ACTUS REUS**

#### **Introduction**

Criminal liability under the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023 is founded on the fundamental principle enshrined in the maxim **"Actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea"**, which means "an act does not make a person guilty unless the mind is also guilty." This maxim establishes that for a crime to be committed, two essential elements must coexist: **Actus Reus** (the physical element) and **Mens Rea** (the mental element). Actus Reus represents the **external** or **physical element** of crime.

---

#### **Definition of Actus Reus**

**Actus Reus** is derived from Latin words:
- **Actus** = Deed or Act
- **Reus** = Guilty or Wrongful

**Definition**: Actus Reus is the **physical element** of a crime. It refers to the **deed of commission** - a material result of human conduct that the law seeks to prevent.

**In Simple Terms**: Actus Reus is the **actual criminal act** or **unlawful omission** that constitutes the physical component of a crime.

---

#### **Nature and Characteristics**

**1️⃣ Physical/External Element**
- Actus Reus is the **outward manifestation** of criminal intent
- It is the **observable** and **tangible** aspect of crime
- Can be an **act**, **omission**, or **state of affairs**

**2️⃣ Result of Human Conduct**
- Must be result of **voluntary human conduct**
- Involuntary acts (reflexes, acts during sleep) generally not Actus Reus
- Must be willed action or conscious omission

**3️⃣ Prohibited by Law**
- The act or omission must be **prohibited** by criminal law
- Not every harmful act is criminal - only those defined by law

---

#### **Types of Actus Reus**

**1. Act (Commission)**
- Positive action that causes harm
- Example: Stabbing, shooting, stealing

**2. Omission (Failure to Act)**
- Failure to perform legal duty
- Example: Parent failing to provide food to child causing death
- Must be legal duty to act

**3. State of Affairs**
- Situation or circumstance itself is criminal
- Example: Being found in possession of stolen property

---

#### **Elements/Requirements of Actus Reus**

**1️⃣ Voluntary Conduct**
- Act must be **voluntary** and **willed**
- Not reflexive or involuntary movement
- Example: If A pushes B, causing B to fall on C - B's falling on C is NOT voluntary act

**2️⃣ Causation**
- Must be **causal link** between act and result
- Act must be **proximate cause** of harm
- Test: "But for" test - would harm have occurred but for accused's act?

**3️⃣ Specific Consequences**
- For result crimes, specific consequence must occur
- Example: In murder, death must result from act

---

#### **Importance of Actus Reus in Criminal Liability**

**1️⃣ Essential Component of Crime**
- No crime without Actus Reus
- Even with criminal intent (Mens Rea), no liability unless act is done
- **Principle**: Mere thoughts are not punishable - "cogitationis poenam nemo patitur"

**Example**: A intends to kill B but does nothing → NO crime (only intention, no act)

**2️⃣ Establishes Physical Harm/Threat**
- Actus Reus demonstrates actual or potential harm to society
- Justifies state intervention and punishment
- Makes crime tangible and provable

**3️⃣ Provides Evidence of Crime**
- Physical acts can be observed and proven
- Unlike mens rea (mental state), actus reus is external and verifiable
- Forms basis of evidence in criminal trials

**4️⃣ Distinguishes Criminal from Civil Wrongs**
- Specific harmful acts prohibited by criminal law constitute crimes
- Same act may be both criminal (murder) and civil (tort of wrongful death)
- Actus Reus defines what is criminal

**5️⃣ Determines Severity/Nature of Crime**
- Nature of Actus Reus determines type of offense
- Example: 
  - Taking property = Theft
  - Taking property with force = Robbery
  - Killing = Homicide

**6️⃣ Basis for Causation Analysis**
- Courts examine whether accused's act caused the harmful result
- Important in determining responsibility when multiple factors involved

---

#### **Relationship Between Actus Reus and Mens Rea**

**General Rule**: Both Actus Reus AND Mens Rea must coexist for criminal liability.

```
Actus Reus + Mens Rea = Criminal Liability
```

**Example**:
- **Murder**: 
  - Actus Reus = Causing death of human being
  - Mens Rea = Intention to kill or cause such bodily injury likely to cause death

**Exception - Strict Liability Offenses**:
- Some offenses require only Actus Reus
- No mens rea required
- Example: Traffic violations, regulatory offenses

---

#### **Illustrations**

**1. Murder by Stabbing**
- **Actus Reus** = Stabbing with knife + Death of victim (result of act)
- **Conduct** = Stabbing
- **Result** = Death
- Both conduct and result together form Actus Reus

**2. Theft**
- **Actus Reus** = Taking movable property + Removing it from possession
- Physical act of taking and moving property

**3. Culpable Homicide**
- **Actus Reus** = Causing death by doing an act
- Could be shooting, poisoning, or any act causing death

---

#### **Conclusion**

Actus Reus is the foundational physical element of criminal liability that represents the external manifestation of crime. Without Actus Reus, there can be no crime, as mere criminal thoughts or intentions are not punishable. The importance of Actus Reus lies in its role as the observable, provable component that justifies criminal prosecution and distinguishes criminal law from mere moral condemnation. Together with Mens Rea, it forms the complete picture of criminal responsibility - the act and the guilty mind working in concert to constitute a crime. As the maxim states, "an act does not make a person guilty unless the mind is also guilty" - emphasizing that while Actus Reus is essential, it must be accompanied by Mens Rea (except in strict liability cases) for full criminal liability.
