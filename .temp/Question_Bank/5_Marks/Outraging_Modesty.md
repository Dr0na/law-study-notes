### **OUTRAGING THE MODESTY OF A WOMAN**

#### **Introduction**

Outraging the modesty of a woman is a serious offense under **Section 74 of the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023** (previously Section 354 IPC), designed to protect the dignity, honor, and modesty of women from unwanted physical contact or gestures. This offense recognizes that women have a fundamental right to bodily integrity and personal dignity, and any act that outrages or offends her sense of decency and modesty is punishable under criminal law.
