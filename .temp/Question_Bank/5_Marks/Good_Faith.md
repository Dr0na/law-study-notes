### **GOOD FAITH**

#### **Introduction**

Good faith is a fundamental concept under the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023 that runs through various provisions, particularly the **general exceptions** under Chapter IV (Sections 4-44). It is a crucial requirement for claiming immunity from criminal liability under defenses such as mistake of fact, private defense, accident, and necessity. Good faith ensures that protection is granted only to those who act honestly and with reasonable care, not to those who act recklessly or with malicious intent.

---

#### **Definition (Section 2(10) BNS)**

**Previously Section 52 IPC**

**"Nothing is said to be done or believed in good faith which is done or believed without due care and attention."**

**Interpretation**: Good faith means an act done **honestly** with **due care and attention**.

---

#### **Two Essential Components of Good Faith**

### **1️⃣ HONESTY**

**Meaning**: Act must be done with honest intention

**Characteristics**:
- Genuine belief in righteousness of act
- No malice or bad motive
- Acting in good conscience
- Bona fide intention

**Example**:
- Police officer arresting person believing genuinely he is accused (honest)
- Person using force believing genuinely it is self-defense (honest)

**NOT Good Faith if**:
- Acting with ill-will or malice
- Acting with ulterior motive
- Knowing act is wrong but proceeding anyway

---

### **2️⃣ DUE CARE AND ATTENTION**

**Meaning**: Act must be done with **reasonable care** and **proper attention** to circumstances

**Standard**: What a **reasonable and prudent person** would do in same circumstances

**NOT**:
- ❌ Does not mean **utmost care** (perfection not required)
- ✅ Means **sufficient care** that reasonable person would exercise

#### **3 Factors for Due Care**

As established in **State of West Bengal v. Shew Mangal Singh**:

**Factor 1: Nature of Act**
- How serious is the act?
- What are its consequences?
- Type of act being performed

**Factor 2: Magnitude and Importance**
- How important is the act?
- What is at stake?
- Degree of harm if wrong

**Factor 3: Facility for Exercise of Care**
- What means does person have to verify facts?
- What opportunity to exercise caution?
- What is reasonably possible in circumstances?

#### **Example of Due Care Analysis**

**Scenario**: Police officer arrests person believing he is wanted criminal

**Due Care Assessment**:
1. **Nature**: Arrest is serious (affects liberty)
2. **Magnitude**: Very important not to arrest innocent person
3. **Facility**: Officer has information, warrant, person matches description

**Conclusion**: If officer verified available information and person resembles accused, acted with due care.

### **III. IMPORTANCE IN GENERAL EXCEPTIONS**

#### **1️⃣ Required in Multiple Exceptions**

Good faith is essential requirement in:

**Section 14 & 17 BNS**: Mistake of Fact
- Person must act in good faith believing he is bound/justified by law

**Sections 34-44 BNS**: Private Defense
- Exceeding right of private defense in good faith reduces murder to CH
- Must act in good faith without premeditation

**Section 18 BNS**: Accident
- Act must be done with proper care and caution (good faith implied)

**Section 81 BNS**: Necessity
- Act must be done in good faith for benefit of person

---

#### **2️⃣ Distinguishes Innocent from Culpable**

**With Good Faith**: Genuine mistake, honest error → Protected

**Without Good Faith**: Reckless, negligent, malicious → NOT Protected

**Example**:
- Doctor operates on wrong patient believing genuinely it's the right one (verified documents) → Good faith → Protected
- Doctor operates without verifying patient identity → NO good faith → Liable

---

#### **3️⃣ Protects Honest Acts**

**Philosophy**: Law should not punish those who:
- Act honestly
- Exercise reasonable care
- Make genuine mistakes despite care

**Encourages**: People to act without fear if acting honestly and carefully

---

#### **4️⃣ Prevents Abuse of Exceptions**

**Without Good Faith Requirement**:
- Anyone could claim mistake/private defense
- Even reckless persons would escape
- Exceptions would be widely abused

**With Good Faith Requirement**:
- Only genuine, careful persons protected
- Reckless/malicious persons excluded
- Balance between protection and accountability

---

### **IV. DISTINCTION: Good Faith vs Bad Faith**

| **Good Faith** | **Bad Faith** |
|---------------|--------------|
| Honest intention | Malicious intent |
| Due care exercised | Reckless/negligent |
| Reasonable verification | No attempt to verify |
| Genuine belief | False claim |
| Protected by law | NOT protected |

---

### **V. CASE LAW**

**State of West Bengal v. Shew Mangal Singh**:

**Facts**: Police opened fire pursuant to Commissioner's order, causing deaths

**Held**: If order was justified and lawful, officer protected

**Principle Established**:
- Good faith requires three factors: nature of act, magnitude, facility for care
- Officer following lawful superior order in good faith protected

---

#### **R v. Prince** (Negative Example):

**Facts**: Took girl below 16, believed she was above 16, but failed to verify

**Held**: NOT good faith - failed to exercise due care

**Principle**: Good faith requires **verification** when possible, not mere belief.

---

### **Conclusion**

Good faith, as defined in Section 2(10) BNS, is a **twin requirement** of **honesty** and **due care and attention**. It is the cornerstone of general exceptions, ensuring that immunity from criminal liability is granted only to those who act with genuine belief and reasonable prudence, not to those who are reckless, negligent, or malicious. The three factors for determining due care - nature of act, magnitude and importance, and facility for exercising care - provide a practical framework for assessing whether a person truly acted in good faith. By requiring good faith in various exceptions, the law strikes a balance between protecting honest mistakes and preventing abuse of defenses, ensuring that criminal liability attaches only to truly blameworthy conduct.
