## Q1. SCHOOLS OF CRIMINOLOGY (VERY HIGH PRIORITY)

**PYQ Frequency:** 5 (2022, 2021, 2019, 2018, 2016) | **ROI:** 10/10

### INTRODUCTION

Schools of Criminology represent evolution of thinking about crime causation and criminal justice response. Each school emerged to address limitations of predecessor.

---

### SCHOOLS OF CRIMINOLOGY (4)

---

#### **1. PRE-CLASSICAL SCHOOL (Before 18th Century)**

**Main Belief:** Crime caused by supernatural forces like demons and evil spirits.

**Trial Methods (3):**
- **Trial by Ordeal:** Test by fire or water - survival meant innocence
- **Trial by Combat:** Physical fight to determine guilt - winner deemed innocent
- **Trial by Oath:** Swear innocence before God with oath-helpers

**Punishment Approach:**
- Cruel and barbaric methods like torture and public executions
- No proportion between crime severity and punishment given
- Aimed at pleasing divine forces and driving out evil

**Key Problem:** No scientific basis, no fairness, innocent often punished.

---

#### **2. CLASSICAL SCHOOL (18th Century - 1764)**

**Founded By:** Cesare Beccaria (1738-1794) and Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832)

**Main Belief:** Humans have free will and rationally choose to commit crime.

**Core Principles (8):**

**a) Free Will:**
- Every human can choose between right and wrong - criminals make rational decision to break law based on free choice.

**b) Hedonistic Calculus:**
- People weigh pleasure vs pain before crime - if benefits exceed costs, crime occurs through cost-benefit analysis.

**c) Punishment as Deterrent:**
- Punishment must deter both individual and society - must be proportionate, certain, swift, and public to be effective.

**d) Legal Reforms:**
- Abolish torture and excessive capital punishment - certainty of punishment matters more than its severity.

**e) Equality Before Law:**
- Same crime equals same punishment for all - no special privileges based on social status or wealth.

**f) Written Laws:**
- Clear codification required - no crime without law (nullum crimen sine lege), laws must be publicly known.

**g) Individual Responsibility:**
- Person responsible for own actions - liability requires both guilty act and guilty mind working together.

**h) Proportionality:**
- Punishment severity must match crime gravity - mathematical scale of punishments for different offenses.

**Criticism (5):**
- Ignores individual differences like age and mental state
- Assumes perfect rationality but many crimes are emotional
- Ignores social factors like poverty and education
- Too rigid with no flexibility for special circumstances
- Unrealistic view that everyone has equal free will

---

#### **3. NEO-CLASSICAL SCHOOL (Late 18th Century)**

**Main Idea:** Classical School principles retained but flexibility added for individual circumstances.

**Key Modifications (5):**

**a) Individual Circumstances:**
- Mental state, age, and criminal history now considered - children treated differently from adults, first offenders different from repeat.

**b) Mitigation and Aggravation:**
- Mitigating factors reduce punishment (mental illness, infancy, provocation, duress) - Aggravating factors increase it (premeditation, cruelty, multiple victims).

**c) Judicial Discretion:**
- Judges given power to individualize sentences - can adjust within limits based on specific case circumstances.

**d) Modified Free Will:**
- Free will acknowledged as not absolute - mental illness and circumstances can limit person's ability to choose freely.

**e) Partial Focus on Criminal:**
- Began considering the person committing act - balance between crime severity and offender's circumstances introduced.

**Comparison:**

| Aspect | Classical | Neo-Classical |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Free Will | Absolute | Modified by circumstances |
| Punishment | Fixed for each crime | Flexible based on factors |
| Mental State | Completely ignored | Considered and evaluated |
| Age | Not relevant | Children treated separately |

---

#### **4. POSITIVIST SCHOOL (Late 19th Century)**

**Main Belief:** Crime caused by factors beyond control, not free will - study criminals scientifically like medical patients.

**Core Principles (6):**

**a) Determinism:**
- Criminal behavior determined by biology, psychology, society - person cannot help it, no free will involved.

**b) Scientific Study:**
- Use experiments, observations, measurements, statistics - evidence-based conclusions replace philosophical debates.

**c) Multiple Causes:**
- Biological (heredity, brain, genes), Psychological (mental illness, personality), Social (poverty, education, family) - all interact to produce crime.

**d) Criminals are Different:**
- Biological or psychological defects distinguish them from normal - can be identified and classified into criminal types.

**e) Focus on Criminal:**
- Study the person, not just the act - understand individual offender's characteristics and background thoroughly.

**f) Treatment not Punishment:**
- Rehabilitate through therapy, education, social reform - punishment alone doesn't work, address root causes instead.

**Two Types:**
- **Radical (Italian):** Biology causes crime - Lombroso, Ferri, Garofalo
- **Liberal (French):** Society causes crime - Gabriel Tarde

### COMPARATIVE TABLE

| Feature | Pre-Classical | Classical | Neo-Classical | Positivist |
|---------|--------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Time** | Before 1700s | 1700s | Late 1700s | 1800s |
| **Approach** | Supernatural | Rational | Modified Rational | Scientific |
| **Focus** | Divine will | Crime act | Crime + Criminal | Criminal person |
| **Free Will** | None | Absolute | Modified | Denied |
| **Cause** | Supernatural | Choice | Choice + circumstances | Bio-psycho-social |
| **Response** | Torture | Punishment | Flexible punishment | Treatment |
| **Goal** | Expiation | Deterrence | Justice | Rehabilitation |

---

### MODERN CONTRIBUTIONS

**From Classical:** No crime without law principle, proportionate punishment, due process rights, fair trial guarantees.

**From Neo-Classical:** Judicial discretion in sentencing, consideration of circumstances, different juvenile treatment, mitigating and aggravating factors.

**From Positivist:** Scientific investigation methods, rehabilitation programs, probation and parole systems, prevention through addressing root causes.

**Modern System:** Successfully blends all three approaches for balanced criminal justice.

---

### CONCLUSION

Evolution from supernatural beliefs through rationality to scientific study shows progress in understanding crime. Classical gave us rule of law, Neo-Classical added flexibility, Positivist introduced science and treatment. Modern systems integrate all three - Classical legality and proportionality, Neo-Classical individualization, Positivist scientific methods and rehabilitation. This synthesis provides comprehensive framework respecting rights while promoting reform.

## Q2. MERTON'S STRAIN THEORY (VERY HIGH PRIORITY)

**PYQ Frequency:** 5 (2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2017) | **ROI:** 10/10

### INTRODUCTION

Robert Merton (1910-2003) developed Strain Theory in 1938 explaining that crime happens when there's gap between what society tells people to achieve and opportunities actually available.

---

### FOUNDATION

**Durkheim's Anomie (1897):**
- Anomie means normlessness - social norms break down during rapid change causing deviance.

**Merton's Adaptation:**
- Modified for American society - focused on gap between cultural goals and institutional means creating strain.

---

### MERTON'S THEORY (2 Components)

**1. Cultural Goals:**
- Society tells EVERYONE to be financially successful - "American Dream" ideology where success equals personal worth.

**2. Institutional Means:**
- Legitimate ways to succeed like education, hard work, career advancement - but NOT equally available to all.

---

### THE PROBLEM: STRAIN

**Merton's Key Insight:**
- Society emphasizes goals for everyone but doesn't provide equal means - this gap creates STRAIN (pressure and frustration).

**Example:** Society says "Be rich!" but reality for poor is "No education, no job, no opportunities" - resulting strain may lead to crime.

---

### FIVE MODES OF ADAPTATION (5)

People respond to strain in five different ways:

---

#### **MODE 1: CONFORMITY (✅ Goals | ✅ Means)**

- Accept goals AND use legitimate means - work hard legally to achieve success, most common response, law-abiding.

**Example:** Student studies, gets degree, finds job legally.

**Result:** No crime.

---

#### **MODE 2: INNOVATION (✅ Goals | ❌ Means)**

- Accept goals BUT use illegal means to achieve them - MOST RELEVANT TO CRIME, explains most property offenses.

**Why:** Blocked legitimate opportunities, poverty, no education, faster results through illegal methods.

**Examples (5):**
- Theft - want money, steal it
- Drug dealing - want wealth, sell drugs
- Fraud - want more, use deception
- Robbery - want money, take by force
- White-collar crime - want more, use illegal corporate methods

**Two Types:**
- Lower-class innovators turn to street crime
- Middle/upper-class innovators turn to white-collar crime

**Result:** Property crime, organized crime, corporate crime.

---

#### **MODE 3: RITUALISM (❌ Goals | ✅ Means)**

- Give up on success goals BUT follow rules rigidly - lower aspirations to avoid failure, overly conformist behavior.

**Example:** Bureaucrat with no ambition who just follows procedures mechanically.

**Result:** Usually not criminal, just gave up trying.

---

#### **MODE 4: RETREATISM (❌ Goals | ❌ Means)**

- Reject both goals and means completely - withdraw from society, least common adaptation.

**Who:** Drug addicts, alcoholics, homeless, mentally ill dropouts.

**Why:** Failed at both legitimate and illegitimate means - double failure leads to complete withdrawal.

**Result:** Drug crimes, vagrancy, minor survival offenses.

---

#### **MODE 5: REBELLION (🔄 Goals | 🔄 Means)**

- Reject existing system AND replace with new goals and means - want to change society fundamentally, not just adapt.

**Who:** Revolutionaries, political terrorists, radical reformers.

**Result:** Political violence, riots, armed rebellion against state.

**Unique Feature:** Only mode trying to change the system itself.

---

### SUMMARY TABLE

| Mode | Goals | Means | Result | Example |
|------|-------|-------|--------|---------|
| Conformity | ✅ | ✅ | No crime | Student works hard |
| Innovation | ✅ | ❌ | **CRIME** | Theft, fraud |
| Ritualism | ❌ | ✅ | Usually no crime | Bureaucrat |
| Retreatism | ❌ | ❌ | Drug crimes | Addict |
| Rebellion | 🔄 | 🔄 | Political violence | Revolutionary |

---

### CRITICAL ANALYSIS

**Strengths (4):**
- Links crime to social structure not individual pathology
- Explains class differences in crime rates scientifically
- Explains both street crime and white-collar crime
- Provides policy implications for social reform

**Limitations (4):**
- Doesn't explain why most poor people don't commit crime
- Difficult to measure "strain" empirically and precisely
- Assumes everyone accepts same cultural goals
- Doesn't explain violent crime adequately

---

### MODERN EXTENSIONS

**General Strain Theory (Agnew, 1992):**
- Broadened beyond just economic goals - added three types: failure to achieve goals, loss of positive things, exposure to negative things.

---

### CONCLUSION

Merton's theory explains crime as rational response when society creates gap between what it tells people to achieve (success for all) and opportunities it provides (education and jobs unequally distributed). Innovation mode using illegal means to achieve legal goals explains most acquisitive crime. Theory shows crime is social structural problem requiring social solutions like providing genuine opportunities, not just individual moral problem requiring punishment. Understanding strain helps develop prevention addressing root causes of inequality and blocked opportunities.

## Q3. SUTHERLAND'S DIFFERENTIAL ASSOCIATION THEORY (VERY HIGH PRIORITY)

**PYQ Frequency:** 5 (2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018) | **ROI:** 10/10

### INTRODUCTION

Edwin Sutherland (1883-1950), "Dean of American Criminology," developed Differential Association Theory in 1939 proposing that criminal behavior is learned through social interaction, not inherited.

---

### CORE PROPOSITION

> Criminal behavior is LEARNED through interaction with others, just like any other behavior.

**Key Points:** Crime NOT inherited, NOT instinctive, LEARNED through normal social processes.

---

### THE NINE PROPOSITIONS

---

#### **PROPOSITION 1: Criminal Behavior is Learned**

- Crime is learned, not inherited - not biological trait passed through genes, anyone can learn if exposed properly.

---

#### **PROPOSITION 2: Learned through Communication**

- Learning occurs through interaction and communication - includes verbal (talking) and non-verbal (gestures, actions) in two-way process.

---

#### **PROPOSITION 3: Learning in Intimate Groups**

**Main Point:** Most important learning happens in close personal groups.

- Family, close friends, gang members have strongest influence - face-to-face contact most powerful for learning crime.
- Media and casual acquaintances have much less influence - intimate relationships matter most for behavioral learning.

---

#### **PROPOSITION 4: Learning Includes Techniques AND Attitudes**

**Two Things Learned:**

**(a) TECHNIQUES (How):**
- How to pick locks, sell drugs, forge documents, avoid capture - practical skills needed to commit crimes successfully.

**(b) ATTITUDES (Why):**
- Justifications like "Rich deserve it" or "Everyone does it" - rationalizations that make crime seem acceptable or justified.

**Both Needed:** Techniques alone insufficient without motivation, attitudes alone insufficient without skills to act.

---

#### **PROPOSITION 5: Learning Definitions**

**Two Types:**

- **Favorable to Crime:** "Laws are unfair," "Snitches get stitches" - make law violation seem acceptable or justified.
- **Unfavorable to Crime:** "Crime is wrong," "Obey law," "Honesty important" - support conventional law-abiding behavior.

---

#### **PROPOSITION 6: THE PRINCIPLE (Core)**

> Person commits crime when exposed to MORE pro-crime definitions than anti-crime definitions.

**Think of Balance:**
```
Pro-Crime Definitions  vs  Anti-Crime Definitions
           ⚖️
If Pro-Crime heavier → CRIME
If Anti-Crime heavier → CONFORMITY
```

**This is the heart of theory!**

---

#### **PROPOSITION 7: Associations Vary (FPDI)**

**Four Dimensions:**

- **F - Frequency:** How often exposed - daily contact stronger than occasional, repetition reinforces learning.
- **D - Duration:** How long exposure lasts - years of association stronger than brief encounters create deeper impact.
- **P - Priority:** How early in life - childhood exposures MOST important, first learned has strongest lasting effect.
- **I - Intensity:** Importance of source - family and close friends strongest, strangers and media weakest influence.

**Example:** Criminal father (frequent daily, long duration, from childhood, most important person) → Very likely criminal child.

---

#### **PROPOSITION 8: All Learning Mechanisms**

- Uses same mechanisms as any other learning - classical conditioning, reinforcement, observation just like learning language or skill.

---

#### **PROPOSITION 9: Same Needs, Different Methods**

- Everyone has same needs (money, status, excitement) - but some learn legal ways, others learn criminal ways to meet needs.
- Need doesn't explain crime - LEARNING determines which method person chooses to meet universal human needs.

---

### VISUAL SUMMARY

```
Person exposed to definitions
        ↓
Pro-Crime (from criminals) vs Anti-Crime (from law-abiding)
        ↓
Ratio determines behavior
        ↓
If Pro > Anti → CRIME
```

---

### POLICY IMPLICATIONS (4)

**1. Prevent Criminal Associations:**
- Break up gangs, separate delinquents - don't mix juveniles with adult criminals in prisons ("criminal university").

**2. Increase Pro-Social Associations:**
- Mentorship programs, positive role models - community involvement and conventional peer groups build prosocial values.

**3. Change Attitudes:**
- Challenge pro-criminal beliefs through education - cognitive therapy helps restructure thinking patterns away from crime.

**4. Strengthen Families:**
- Parenting programs and early intervention - family is primary socialization agent requiring support.

---

### CRITICISM (4)

**1. Hard to Test:**
- Difficult to measure "excess of definitions" empirically - vague concept lacks precise measurement tools.

**2. First Criminal Problem:**
- If crime is learned, who taught the first criminal ever - logical problem with pure learning theory.

**3. Ignores Individual Differences:**
- Same associations produce different outcomes - why do some resist criminal influence while others succumb.

**4. Circular Reasoning:**
- "Why crime?" "Learned it" "How know?" "Committed crime" - tautological argument difficult to falsify scientifically.

---

### CONCLUSION

Differential Association Theory revolutionized criminology by proving criminal behavior is learned through social interaction in intimate groups. Nine propositions explain how excess exposure to pro-criminal definitions leads to crime. While facing measurement challenges, theory provides foundation for modern social learning theories and practical prevention focusing on changing associations, strengthening prosocial bonds, and challenging pro-criminal attitudes. Core insight that crime is learned behavior, not inherited trait, guides contemporary rehabilitation and prevention programs.

## Q4. CRIMINAL PSYCHOLOGY: APPROACHES (HIGH PRIORITY)

**PYQ Frequency:** 5 (2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018) | **ROI:** 9/10

### INTRODUCTION

Criminal Psychology studies criminal mind and behavior applying psychological knowledge to understand, investigate, and prevent crime through three main approaches.

---

### MEANING AND PURPOSE

**Definition:** Study of mental processes, motivations, and behavior of criminals - combines theory with practical application.

**Etymology:** Greek "psuchi" (soul/mind) + "logos" (study) - literally means study of mind/soul.

**Purpose (4):**
- Find WHY someone committed crime through psychological analysis
- Understand reactions during and after crime commission
- Assist police and courts in investigations
- Predict future behavior and assess risk of re-offending

**Scope:** Investigation, court testimony, prison rehabilitation, police training, victim counseling, risk assessment.

---

### THREE APPROACHES

---

#### **APPROACH 1: PSYCHOANALYTICAL**

**Founded By:** Sigmund Freud

**Focus:** Unconscious mind and early childhood experiences determine personality and behavior patterns.

---

##### Freud's Personality Structure (3)

**ID:**
- Primitive drives present at birth, unconscious biological needs (food, sex, sleep) - operates on Pleasure Principle seeking immediate satisfaction, impulsive and demanding.

**EGO:**
- Develops after Id as mediator, conscious and unconscious functions - operates on Reality Principle adapting desires to practical reality, rational and considers consequences.

**SUPEREGO:**
- Moral conscience developing through socialization, internalizes values from parents and society - operates on Morality Principle guiding toward moral behavior, creates guilt when violated.

---

##### Crime from Imbalance (3)

**Overdeveloped Id:** Strong primitive urges, weak Ego control, weak Superego provides no guilt - results in impulsive violent crimes without remorse.

**Underdeveloped Superego:** No moral conscience developed, no guilt feelings after wrongdoing - results in psychopathic behavior and repeated offending.

**Overdeveloped Superego:** Excessive guilt and need for punishment, unconscious desire for punishment - results in crime as self-punishment mechanism.

**Freud's Summary:** Criminal is aggressive, frustrated person dominated by childhood events shaping personality.

---

##### Other Theorists (2)

**Alfred Adler - Inferiority Complex:**
- Physical defects, ugly appearance, low social status create inferiority complex - crime compensates for inadequacy, attempt to prove superiority and gain recognition.

**August Aichorn - Faulty Parenting:**
- Both extremes harmful: parental neglect (no love) makes child feel unloved leading to antisocial behavior, over-indulgence (too much love) spoils child who cannot accept limits leading to crime - balance essential, criminal parents influence children negatively.

---

#### **APPROACH 2: PSYCHOLOGICAL**

**Focus:** Observable behavior rather than unconscious mind - scientific, measurable, testable approach.

**Characteristics:**
- Uses experiments and psychological tests for objectivity
- Studies what can be observed and measured directly
- Emphasizes learning, conditioning, cognition processes
- Less focus on unconscious and distant childhood
- More focus on current behavior and environmental factors

---

#### **APPROACH 3: BEHAVIOURIST**

**Main Idea:** Criminal behavior learned and reinforced through group behavior systems.

**Focus Areas:**
- How groups coordinate criminal activity together
- How criminal behavior learned and reinforced socially
- How environment shapes criminal conduct patterns
- Mutual cooperation among criminals in groups

**Characteristics (4):**
- Individual or group participation in crimes
- Common behavior patterns shared across offenders
- Joint cooperation essential for organized crime
- Social reinforcement maintains criminal behavior

---

### COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

| Aspect | Psychoanalytical | Psychological | Behaviourist |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Focus** | Unconscious mind | Observable behavior | Group behavior |
| **Method** | Therapy, case studies | Experiments, tests | Pattern observation |
| **Cause** | Personality conflict | Learned behavior | Group reinforcement |
| **Childhood** | Crucial determinant | Important not sole | Less emphasized |
| **Treatment** | Psychotherapy | Behavior modification | Social restructuring |
| **Level** | Individual internal | Individual behavioral | Group/social |

---

### APPLICATIONS

**Investigation:** Understanding criminal motivation, profiling offenders, developing interview and interrogation strategies tailored to psychology.

**Courts:** Expert testimony on mental state, competency evaluation, criminal responsibility assessment, sentencing recommendations based on psychological factors.

**Prisons:** Psychological assessment of inmates, treatment program design, risk assessment for parole, rehabilitation monitoring and progress evaluation.

---

### CONCLUSION

Criminal Psychology's three approaches—psychoanalytical (unconscious conflicts, childhood), psychological (observable behavior, learning), behaviourist (group systems, reinforcement)—provide comprehensive framework for understanding criminal mind. Psychoanalytical explores deep personality structures, psychological applies scientific methods to measurable behavior, behaviourist examines social reinforcement in groups. Modern practice integrates all three recognizing crime results from complex interaction of intrapsychic conflicts, learned behaviors, and social group dynamics. Understanding these approaches enables development of effective prevention, investigation, and rehabilitation strategies based on scientific psychological knowledge rather than mere punishment alone.

---

## Q5. HIRSCHI'S SOCIAL BOND THEORY (HIGH PRIORITY)

**PYQ Frequency:** 5 (2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018) | **ROI:** 9/10

### INTRODUCTION

Travis Hirschi (1935-2017) asked different question in "Causes of Delinquency" (1969): not "Why do people commit crime?" but "Why DON'T people commit crime?" Answer: strong social bonds prevent crime.

---

### FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION

**Hirschi's Insight:** Crime is easy and tempting, human nature is selfish - real puzzle is why people obey law, not why they break it.

> When social bonds are weak, people are FREE to commit crime.

---

### FOUR ELEMENTS OF SOCIAL BOND (A-C-I-B)

---

#### **1. ATTACHMENT**

**Definition:** Emotional bond to others like parents, teachers, friends, spouse - sensitivity to their opinions matters.

**Strong Attachment:**
- Care what they think, don't want to disappoint them, fear losing respect - result is conformity to avoid hurting relationships.

**Weak Attachment:**
- Don't care about others, nothing to lose emotionally, no fear of disappointing anyone - result is freedom to commit crime.

**Most Important:** Parental attachment - quality of relationship matters more than whether parents present, strong bond with parents strongly prevents delinquency.

---

#### **2. COMMITMENT**

**Definition:** Investment in conventional life like education, career, reputation - rational stake in conformity, something to lose.

**High Commitment:**
- Much invested through years of education and career building, good reputation to maintain, future prospects at stake - too risky to commit crime, too much to lose.

**Low Commitment:**
- Nothing invested in future, no career prospects or qualifications, no reputation to lose - nothing holding back from crime, nothing to risk.

**Example:** Medical student in final year won't risk crime (5 years invested, career at stake) vs school dropout with no prospects (little to lose).

---

#### **3. INVOLVEMENT**

**Definition:** Time and energy spent in conventional activities - busy with legitimate pursuits like school, work, hobbies.

**Principle:** "Idle hands are devil's workshop"

**High Involvement:**
- Schedule fully occupied with school, work, activities, tired at end of day - no time or opportunity for delinquency.

**Low Involvement:**
- Much unstructured free time, bored and idle, hanging out with nothing to do - time and opportunity for crime available.

**Research:** Youth heavily involved in conventional activities commit significantly less crime.

---

#### **4. BELIEF**

**Definition:** Acceptance of conventional morality - belief that rules should be obeyed, internalized moral values.

**Strong Belief:**
- Law is legitimate and just, rules should be obeyed, crime is morally wrong - conform because it's right thing to do morally.

**Weak Belief:**
- Law not legitimate, rules are unjust or unfair, crime not necessarily wrong - no moral constraint operating against crime.

**Key:** Not about fear of punishment (external) but internalized morality (internal) guiding behavior voluntarily.

---

### HOW BONDS PREVENT CRIME

```
STRONG BONDS → Don't hurt loved ones + Too much to lose + No time + Morally wrong → CONFORMITY

WEAK BONDS → Don't care + Nothing to lose + Free time + No morality → FREE TO COMMIT CRIME
```

---

### EMPIRICAL SUPPORT

**Strong Research Evidence:**
- Attachment to parents reduces delinquency significantly
- Educational commitment lowers offending rates measurably
- Activity involvement protective factor proven
- Belief in rules strongly predicts conformity

**One of most tested and supported theories in all of criminology.**

---

### POLICY IMPLICATIONS (4)

**1. Strengthen Attachment:** Family programs, parent-child bonding, mentorship with positive adults.

**2. Increase Commitment:** Education opportunities, job training, career counseling - help youth invest in conventional future.

**3. Increase Involvement:** After-school programs, sports leagues, arts programs - keep youth busy and engaged productively.

**4. Strengthen Belief:** Moral education, character development, fair rules, legitimate authority - build internal moral values.

---

### CRITICISM (4)

**1. Causal Order:** Do weak bonds cause crime or does crime weaken bonds - direction unclear, might be reciprocal.

**2. Criminal Bonds:** Ignores attachment to criminal friends and commitment to criminal career - theory incomplete.

**3. Tautological:** Circular reasoning - weak bonds defined by crime, crime explained by weak bonds.

**4. Ignores Motivation:** Doesn't explain why people WANT to commit crime initially - assumes crime naturally attractive to everyone.

---

### CONCLUSION

Social Bond Theory explains conformity through four elements: attachment (emotional bonds), commitment (investment in future), involvement (busy with activities), belief (internalized morality). Strong bonds prevent crime, weak bonds allow it. Theory has excellent empirical support and provides practical prevention guidance through strengthening family bonds, educational commitment, structured activities, and moral development. While facing some criticisms regarding causation and circularity, practical applications in youth programs and community interventions demonstrate enduring value of bonding approach to crime prevention.

## Q6. COHEN'S DELINQUENT SUBCULTURE THEORY (HIGH PRIORITY)

**PYQ Frequency:** 5 (2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2017) | **ROI:** 9/10

### INTRODUCTION

Albert Cohen (1918-2014) in "Delinquent Boys" (1955) explained why lower-class boys form gangs committing non-utilitarian crimes like vandalism and fighting—crimes bringing no money or material benefit.

---

### THE PROBLEM: STATUS FRUSTRATION

#### Middle-Class Measuring Rod

**Concept:** Schools judge all students by middle-class standards - evaluation system designed for middle-class children applied universally.

**Middle-Class Values Expected:** Ambition and future planning, academic achievement, good manners, respect for property, verbal skills, non-violence.

**Lower-Class Reality:** Live in present focused on immediate needs, survival focus not achievement, physical toughness valued, limited vocabulary, direct communication style.

---

#### Lower-Class Boys in School

**What Happens:** Family hasn't prepared them for middle-class expectations, lack required values and skills, teachers judge by middle-class standards - SYSTEMATIC FAILURE results.

**Consequences:** Poor grades and academic failure, teacher disapproval and negative labeling, rejection by middle-class peers, feelings of inadequacy and humiliation.

---

#### Status Frustration Defined

> Frustration from failing to achieve status in middle-class institutions, particularly schools.

**Process:** Lower-class boys → Middle-class school → Judged by standards they can't meet → FAILURE and humiliation → STATUS FRUSTRATION builds.

---

### THE SOLUTION: DELINQUENT SUBCULTURE

#### Formation (4 Steps)

**Step 1:** Many boys face same frustration - share common problem of school failure and rejection.

**Step 2:** Come together to form gangs - find others with similar struggles and experiences.

**Step 3:** Reaction Formation - overreact in opposite direction to what frustrated them, INVERT middle-class values completely creating opposite value system.

**Step 4:** New Status System created - status now gained through delinquency not achievement, gang provides alternative recognition and respect.

---

### CHARACTERISTICS (6)

**1. Non-Utilitarian:**
- Crime NOT for money or material gain - vandalism brings no benefit, joyriding just for fun, fighting without profit motive.
- Purpose is rejecting middle-class values, not economic gain.

**2. Malicious:**
- Acts seem spiteful aimed at middle class - deliberately attacking symbols of what rejected them like school property.

**3. Negativistic:**
- Values complete OPPOSITE of middle-class - inversion not just rejection, everything middle class values they devalue and vice versa.

| Middle-Class Value | Subculture Value |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Respect property | Destroy property |
| Academic achievement | Reject education |
| Politeness | Disrespect |
| Plan future | Live for now |

**4. Versatile:**
- Variety of crimes without specialization - theft today, vandalism tomorrow, not professional criminals focusing on one type.

**5. Short-Run Hedonism:**
- Immediate pleasure focus without long-term planning - live for moment, no concern for future consequences.

**6. Group Autonomy:**
- Strong gang loyalty and resistance to authority - "Us vs Them" mentality, gang becomes substitute family.

---

### STATUS ACHIEVEMENT

**Middle-Class:** Good grades, career success, material possessions bring respect and status.

**Delinquent Subculture:** Physical toughness, daring criminal acts, defying authority successfully, loyalty to gang bring respect and status.

---

### COHEN VS MERTON

| Aspect | Merton | Cohen |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Goal Sought | Monetary success | Status and respect |
| Crime Type | Utilitarian (theft for money) | Non-utilitarian (vandalism) |
| Class | All classes | Lower-class boys specifically |
| Solution | Individual innovation | Collective gang subculture |
| Purpose | Achieve material success | Reject middle-class values |

---

### POLICY IMPLICATIONS (4)

**1. Change Schools:** Multiple pathways to success not just academic, vocational education alongside traditional, don't judge all by same standard.

**2. Alternative Status:** Sports where physical skills valued, arts and music programs, youth clubs - legitimate ways to gain respect.

**3. Reduce Inequality:** Early childhood programs preparing for school, better support for disadvantaged families bridging class gap.

**4. Community Programs:** After-school activities with supervision, structured recreation, skill-building opportunities for youth.

---

### CRITICISM (4)

- Not all lower-class boys form gangs, many succeed in school
- Some gang crime IS utilitarian like drug dealing for money
- Theory ignores female delinquency completely, only about boys
- Hard to measure "status frustration" concept empirically

---

### CONCLUSION

Cohen's theory explains gang delinquency as collective solution to status frustration experienced in middle-class institutions. Lower-class boys systematically failing in schools form gangs with inverted values where delinquency brings status replacing academic achievement. Six characteristics—non-utilitarian, malicious, negativistic, versatile, hedonistic, autonomous—capture essence of gang culture as reaction against middle-class rejection. Policy should provide alternative legitimate paths to status and respect for all youth, not just those succeeding by middle-class academic standards, addressing root cause of status frustration through inclusive recognition systems.

## Q7. BECKER'S LABELLING THEORY (HIGH PRIORITY)

**PYQ Frequency:** 5 (2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017) | **ROI:** 9/10

### INTRODUCTION

Howard Becker (1928-2023) in "Outsiders" (1963) shifted focus from "Why crime?" to "How are people LABELED as criminals?" Deviance is not inherent in acts but created by society's reactions and labeling.

---

### CORE PROPOSITIONS (2)

**1. Deviance Not Inherent:**
- No act is naturally criminal - society decides what's criminal, definitions change by place and time.
- Example: Alcohol legal in India but illegal in Saudi Arabia, marijuana legal in some US states but illegal in India.

**2. Labelling Creates Deviance:**
- Society creates deviance by making rules and applying them to certain people - labeling process itself produces deviant identity and behavior.

---

### PRIMARY VS SECONDARY DEVIANCE

**Concept by Edwin Lemert**

---

#### **PRIMARY DEVIANCE**

**Definition:** Initial minor rule-breaking, not part of person's identity - experimental and situational behavior.

**Characteristics:**
- First-time or occasional offense, easily rationalized
- Not central to self-concept or how person sees themselves
- Most people commit some primary deviance in life
- Doesn't lead to criminal identity if not caught

**Examples:** Teenager shoplifts once, student cheats on exam, person tries drugs once.

**Outcome:** If not caught and labeled, person usually stops and returns to normal conforming behavior.

---

#### **SECONDARY DEVIANCE**

**Definition:** Deviant behavior becomes part of identity after being labeled - criminal role becomes master status defining person.

**Process:**
```
Primary Deviance → CAUGHT & LABELED ("criminal") → Treated as deviant → Internalize label → Identity changes ("I AM criminal") → SECONDARY DEVIANCE (lifestyle) → Criminal career
```

**Characteristics:**
- Repeated crimes become pattern, crime central to identity
- Adopt criminal lifestyle and join deviant groups
- Very hard to stop once identity formed

---

### MASTER STATUS

**Definition:** Label that overrides all other characteristics and identities a person has.

**Example:** Person is father, employee, volunteer but gets convicted - labeled "criminal" becomes master status overriding everything, everyone sees them as criminal FIRST, other positive identities fade away.

**Effect:** Becomes self-fulfilling prophecy creating the reality it describes.

---

### LABELLING PROCESS (6 Stages)

**Stage 1 - Rule-Breaking:** Many break rules but not all caught - random or selective enforcement.

**Stage 2 - Detection:** Depends on power (rich escape, poor caught), race, class, visibility, police practices.

**Stage 3 - Labelling:** Formal (arrest, conviction, record) and Informal (reputation, gossip, exclusion).

**Stage 4 - Status Degradation:** Court proceedings and prison strip old identity, assign criminal identity publicly.

**Stage 5 - Accept Label:** Person sees self as criminal, others treat as criminal, opportunities close, forced to associate with other criminals.

**Stage 6 - Secondary Deviance:** Crime becomes way of life, criminal career begins, hard to return to conventional life.

---

### SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY

**How Label Creates Reality:**

- Employers won't hire ex-convicts → No job → Poverty → Back to crime for survival
- Schools expel labeled students → No education → No opportunities → Turn to crime
- Family may reject → No support → Join gang for belonging → More crime
- Police watch closely → Caught again easily → Cycle reinforces itself

**Result:** Label creates the very criminal behavior it describes.

---

### WHO GETS LABELED?

**Key Factors (5):**
- Social class - poor more likely labeled than rich who can afford lawyers
- Race and ethnicity - minorities face higher labeling rates
- Age - youth caught more but sometimes diverted
- Appearance and demeanor - stereotypes about "criminal look" affect outcomes
- Context - same act in different settings produces different labels

**Point:** Not just what you do, but WHO you are determines labeling.

---

### DEVIANCE AMPLIFICATION

**Definition:** Societal reaction INCREASES deviance instead of reducing it - spiral effect.

**Example:** Youth shoplifts once (minor) → Expelled, labeled "thief" → Can't get job → Joins gang → Serious crimes → Career criminal. Minor act amplified into criminal career through labeling process.

---

### POLICY IMPLICATIONS (5)

**1. Avoid Labelling:** Divert youth from system when possible, handle minor offenses informally.

**2. Decriminalization:** Remove criminal labels for minor acts, use civil penalties instead.

**3. No Imprisonment:** Community programs avoid stigma of incarceration and criminal record.

**4. Reintegrative Shaming:** Shame the ACT not the PERSON, forgive and reintegrate, don't permanently stigmatize.

**5. Seal Records:** Remove criminal records after time passes, give genuine second chance for reintegration.

---

### CRITICISM (4)

- Doesn't explain WHY first crime committed, only explains secondary deviance after labeling
- Overstates labeling effect, many overcome labels successfully through resilience
- Romanticizes deviance, portrays criminals as victims while ignoring real victims of crime
- Works better for minor deviance, doesn't explain serious violence well

---

### CONCLUSION

Labelling Theory shows societal reaction can create career criminals from minor offenders. When labeled, treated as criminal, and denied opportunities, person adopts criminal identity (secondary deviance). Label becomes self-fulfilling prophecy through master status, stigmatization, and deviance amplification spiral. Policy favors diversion, decriminalization, and reintegration over harsh labeling and punishment. Theory reminds us that criminal justice intervention can paradoxically increase crime if it creates permanent stigma, so interventions must consider long-term identity effects and provide pathways back to conventional life.

## Q8. POSITIVIST SCHOOL THINKERS (HIGH PRIORITY)

**PYQ Frequency:** 4 (2021, 2020, 2018, 2017) | **ROI:** 9/10

### INTRODUCTION

Three Italian criminologists—Lombroso, Ferri, Garofalo—founded Positivist School applying scientific method to crime study, shifting focus from crime to criminal and from punishment to treatment.

---

### 1. CESARE LOMBROSO (1835-1909)

**Title:** "Father of Modern Criminology" and "Father of Criminal Anthropology"

**Book:** "The Criminal Man" (1876)

---

#### Theory: Born Criminal

**Main Idea:** Criminals are BORN not made - can be identified by physical characteristics indicating biological defects.

**Atavism Theory:**
- Criminals are evolutionary throwbacks - represent earlier stage of human evolution resembling primitive humans or apes.

---

#### Physical Stigmata (Signs)

**Cranial:** Abnormal skull, low forehead, large jaw, prominent cheekbones, asymmetrical face.

**Facial:** Small eyes, large ears, twisted nose, thick lips, sparse beard.

**Body:** Long arms (ape-like), excessive tattoos, abnormal teeth, extra fingers/toes.

---

#### Classification (4)

**1. Born Criminals (40%):** Possess physical stigmata, cannot be reformed - biological destiny to commit crime.

**2. Insane Criminals:** Mental illness causes crime - need medical treatment, not punishment.

**3. Criminaloids:** Weak nature triggered by environment - can commit crime under certain conditions.

**4. Criminals of Passion:** Emotional crimes (love, honor) - one-time offenders, otherwise normal.

---

#### Criticism (5)

- Unscientific methodology with small sample and no control group
- Physical stigmata theory completely disproved by later research
- Ignored all social factors like poverty and education
- Too deterministic, removed personal responsibility completely
- Ethical issues including stereotyping based on appearance

**Contribution:** Introduced scientific method even though specific findings were wrong.

---

### 2. ENRICO FERRI (1856-1929)

**Title:** "Father of Positive School"

**Book:** "Criminal Sociology" (1884)

---

#### Theory: Multiple Factors

**Main Idea:** Crime caused by THREE types of factors working together, not just biology alone.

---

#### Three Causes (3)

**1. Anthropological (Individual):**
- Biological (age, sex, heredity) and Psychological (intelligence, temperament) - individual characteristics of person matter.

**2. Physical (Natural Environment):**
- Climate, temperature, seasons, geography - example: violent crimes increase in hot summer weather.

**3. Social (Social Environment):**
- Poverty, unemployment, education, family, urbanization, political system - society's conditions shape criminal behavior significantly.

---

#### Classification (5)

**1. Born Criminals:** Biological tendency - difficult to reform.

**2. Insane Criminals:** Mental illness causes - need treatment.

**3. Habitual Criminals:** Environment made them criminal - can be reformed through environmental change.

**4. Occasional Criminals:** By chance or opportunity - easily reformed.

**5. Passionate Criminals:** Emotion-driven - usually don't repeat.

---

#### Key Concepts

**Law of Criminal Saturation:**
- Every society has certain crime level determined by conditions - like salt dissolving in water, crime "saturates" at level determined by social, physical, anthropological factors.

**Penal Substitutes:**
- Instead of punishment, use social measures - free trade, cheap housing, street lighting, education reform, tax changes address root causes.

**Contribution:** Broadened criminology from pure biology to include social factors - multiple causation model used today.

---

### 3. RAFFAELE GAROFALO (1852-1934)

**Profession:** Italian jurist and criminologist

**Book:** "Criminologia" (1885)

---

#### Theory: Natural Crime

**Main Idea:** Distinction between natural crime (universal) and legal crime (varies by place and time).

**Two Moral Sentiments:**
- **Probity:** Respect for property rights - violation creates property crimes.
- **Pity:** Compassion for human life - violation creates violent crimes.

**Natural Crime:** Acts violating these sentiments like murder and robbery - wrong everywhere and always.

**Legal Crime:** Acts violating specific laws like tax evasion - varies by country and era.

---

#### Classification (4)

**1. Murderers:** Completely lack pity - eliminate through death penalty for societal protection.

**2. Violent Criminals:** Deficient in pity - life imprisonment or transportation to isolate from society.

**3. Property Criminals:** Lack probity - transportation and forced labor as punishment.

**4. Sex Offenders:** Morally deficient - treatment varies by severity of offense.

**Note:** Garofalo harshest of three - favored elimination of incurable dangerous criminals.

---

#### Contribution

- Provided legal and moral framework to Positivist School - concept of universal crimes influenced international criminal law development.

---

### COMPARISON

| Aspect | Lombroso | Ferri | Garofalo |
|--------|----------|-------|----------|
| Focus | Biology, physical traits | Multiple factors combined | Law and morality |
| Cause | Born criminal with atavism | Bio + Social + Physical | Moral deficiency |
| Treatment | Identify and control | Social reform prevents | Eliminate dangerous |
| Approach | Anthropological | Sociological | Jurisprudential |

**Progress:** Lombroso started biology → Ferri added society → Garofalo added law.

---

### CONCLUSION

The triumvirate established scientific criminology as alternative to Classical School. Lombroso's biological determinism proved flawed but introduced scientific method. Ferri's multiple causation (bio-psycho-social) remains foundational today. Garofalo's natural crime concept provided philosophical basis for universal criminal justice. Together they shifted justice from retribution to treatment, free will to determinism, punishment to prevention. Modern criminology retains scientific methodology and multi-causal approach while rejecting strict biological determinism and harsh elimination policies.

## Q9. PSYCHOMETRIC TESTS AND CRIMINAL PROFILING (HIGH PRIORITY)

**PYQ Frequency:** 4 (2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017) | **ROI:** 8/10

### INTRODUCTION

Psychometric testing measures criminal tendencies through standardized tests while criminal profiling predicts offender characteristics from crime scene evidence - both aid investigation and assessment scientifically.

---

### PART A: PSYCHOMETRIC TESTS

#### Purpose (4)
- Assessment of mental state and risk level
- Prediction of re-offending likelihood for parole decisions
- Treatment planning with appropriate program design
- Research on crime patterns scientifically

---

#### Major Tests (5 Categories)

**1. Intelligence Tests:**
- WAIS (Wechsler) measures IQ and cognitive abilities - low IQ linked to poor judgment but NOT cause of crime, just risk factor.

**2. Personality Tests:**
- MMPI (Minnesota) with 567 questions identifies antisocial tendencies - most widely used in forensic settings globally.
- PCL-R (Psychopathy Checklist) by Robert Hare scores 0-40 with above 30 indicating psychopathy - measures lack of empathy, manipulation, impulsivity.

**3. Projective Tests:**
- Rorschach inkblot test reveals unconscious thoughts - aggressive themes indicate violent tendencies.
- TAT (picture stories) shows psychological themes - aggression, authority conflict, interpersonal issues.

**4. Neuropsychological Tests:**
- Assess brain function and damage - frontal lobe damage causes impulsivity and poor judgment affecting behavior.

**5. Risk Assessment:**
- VRAG, HCR-20 predict future violence - guide parole and supervision decisions based on statistical risk factors.

---

### PART B: CRIMINAL PROFILING

**Definition:** Predicting offender characteristics from crime scene evidence - identifies likely age, gender, personality, lifestyle patterns.

---

#### Types (3)

**1. Crime Scene Analysis (FBI):** Analyzes physical evidence, victim selection, weapon use, violence level, crime organization.

**2. Investigative Psychology (Canter):** Scientific statistical approach based on research data, not intuition - five aspects analyzed systematically.

**3. Geographical Profiling:** Location patterns of crimes predict where offender lives or will strike next.

---

#### Process (6 Steps)

**Step 1 - Assimilate:** Collect all crime information including photos, reports, autopsy, witness statements, victimology.

**Step 2 - Classify:** Organized vs disorganized offender type, crime motive categorization, risk level assessment.

**Step 3 - Reconstruct:** Crime sequence and timeline reconstruction, understand offender's behavior during commission.

**Step 4 - Profile:** Generate offender characteristics - demographics (age, gender), psychological traits, behavioral patterns, lifestyle.

**Step 5 - Investigate:** Use profile to narrow suspects, guide interview strategies, prioritize leads.

**Step 6 - Apprehend:** Aid in capture strategy, tailor interrogation approach, elicit confession techniques.

---

#### FBI Classification

| Feature | Organized | Disorganized |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| IQ | Above average | Below average |
| Planning | Planned | Spontaneous |
| Scene | Controlled | Chaotic |
| Victim | Targeted | Opportunity |
| Weapon | Brings own | Uses at scene |
| Evidence | Minimal left | Extensive left |
| Social | Good skills | Loner, poor skills |
| Work | Employed | Unemployed |

---

#### Key Factors (3)

**1. Crime Scene:** Weapon type, force used, body positioning, items taken or left - reveals offender's skill and psychological state.

**2. Victimology:** Who targeted and why, lifestyle and risk level - high-risk victim easier, low-risk suggests skilled offender.

**3. MO vs Signature:**
- **MO (Method):** How crime done, CAN change with experience, serves functional purpose of completing crime and avoiding capture.
- **Signature:** Psychological need expressed, DOESN'T change over time, unique to offender, provides emotional gratification unnecessary for crime itself.
- **Key:** Signature more reliable for linking serial cases because it remains stable.

---

### MERITS (7)

- Narrows suspect pool saving time and resources
- Guides investigation direction and prioritizes leads effectively
- Links serial cases across jurisdictions identifying patterns
- Generates new leads predicting offender location and next moves
- Aids court testimony and risk assessment
- Helps prevention by identifying potential targets
- Improves interview and interrogation strategies

---

### DEMERITS (8)

- Lack of scientific rigor, often intuition-based rather than research
- Inaccuracy problems with vague profiles fitting many people
- Confirmation bias causing tunnel vision in investigations
- Limited applicability, works best only for serial crimes
- Resource intensive requiring expensive trained experts
- Ethical concerns about stereotyping and discrimination
- Unrealistic expectations from TV creating false impressions
- Legal issues, not admissible as primary evidence in court

---

### CONCLUSION

Psychometric tests (MMPI, PCL-R, risk assessment tools) provide objective measurement of criminal tendencies. Criminal profiling predicts offender from crime characteristics using FBI's organized vs disorganized classification, MO vs signature distinction, and systematic six-step process. While profiling has significant limitations including lack of rigorous science, inaccuracy risks, and ethical concerns, when used cautiously by trained professionals specifically for serial crimes, it can enhance investigations by narrowing suspects and guiding strategies. Both tools valuable when limitations recognized and ethical standards maintained throughout application.

## Q10. SOCIAL DISORGANIZATION THEORY (HIGH PRIORITY)

**PYQ Frequency:** 4 (2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017) | **ROI:** 8/10

### INTRODUCTION

Chicago School sociologists (1920s-1930s) developed Social Disorganization Theory explaining why certain neighborhoods have more crime than others - crime results from area characteristics not bad people.

**Key Figures:** Robert Park, Ernest Burgess, Clifford Shaw, Henry McKay.

---

### CORE CONCEPT

**Social Disorganization:** Community's inability to regulate itself and control crime - breakdown of effective social institutions and informal control mechanisms result in high crime rates.

---

### CONCENTRIC ZONE MODEL (5 Zones)

Burgess studied Chicago and identified 5 zones expanding from center:

```
[Zone I - Central Business]
[Zone II - Transition] ← HIGHEST CRIME
[Zone III - Working Class]
[Zone IV - Residential]  
[Zone V - Suburbs] ← LOWEST CRIME
```

**Zone I - Central Business:** Commercial area with offices and factories, low residential population.

**Zone II - Transition:** HIGHEST crime rate area with deteriorating buildings, recent immigrants and poorest residents, high population turnover, most socially disorganized.

**Zone III - Working Class:** Stable working-class neighborhoods, better conditions than Zone II, lower crime rates.

**Zone IV - Residential:** Middle-class homes with good conditions, low crime rates, stable families.

**Zone V - Suburbs:** Affluent suburban areas with LOWEST crime rates, highest socioeconomic status.

---

### KEY FINDING (Shaw & McKay)

> Crime stayed HIGH in Zone II even when ethnic groups completely changed over decades.

**Example:** Irish moved out, Italians moved in → Crime stayed high. Italians moved out, Polish moved in → Crime still stayed high.

**Revolutionary Insight:** NOT the people's ethnicity causing crime but the AREA characteristics - place matters more than people living there.

---

### CHARACTERISTICS OF DISORGANIZED AREAS (5)

**1. Residential Instability:**
- High turnover with people constantly moving - no attachment to community forms, residents don't care about neighborhood.

**2. Ethnic Heterogeneity:**
- Many different ethnic and language groups - communication barriers and mistrust, cannot unite for common goals.

**3. Economic Deprivation:**
- High poverty and unemployment rates - struggling families focused on survival, less community involvement capacity.

**4. Weak Institutions:**
- Poor quality schools and weak religious institutions - few community organizations providing social support.

**5. Physical Deterioration:**
- Dilapidated buildings and abandoned properties - "broken windows" signal lack of control and care.

---

### BREAKDOWN OF SOCIAL CONTROL

#### What Should Happen

**Informal Social Control:** Neighbors monitor behavior, adults supervise youth, community pressure maintains standards, collective enforcement of norms.

#### What Actually Happens in Disorganized Areas

- People don't know neighbors personally
- Fear prevents intervention in problems
- "Not my problem" mentality prevails
- Youth unsupervised and roam freely
- Crime increases without oversight

---

### COLLECTIVE EFFICACY (Modern Concept)

**Definition:** Social cohesion plus willingness to intervene for common good - Sampson & Raudenbush 1990s research.

**Components:**
- Social Cohesion: Trust, shared values, community feeling, strong social ties among neighbors.
- Informal Control: Willingness to intervene, monitor youth, confront troublemakers, maintain order together.

**Key Finding:** High collective efficacy → Low crime EVEN in poor areas - organization matters more than poverty alone, empowerment is protective.

---

### POLICY IMPLICATIONS (4)

**1. Increase Stability:** Home ownership programs, keep long-term residents, reduce turnover through incentives building neighborhood attachment.

**2. Strengthen Community:** Support organizations, block watch programs, community centers, religious institutions - build collective efficacy deliberately.

**3. Improve Physical Environment:** Repair buildings, better lighting, remove graffiti quickly - signal community cares and maintains control.

**4. Empower Residents:** Community policing partnerships, resident councils with decision power, local control over resources giving voice.

---

### CRITICISM (3)

- Most people in disorganized areas don't commit crime, ignores individual variation within same environment
- Focuses only on lower-class street crime, white-collar crime not explained by area characteristics
- Causal direction unclear whether disorganization causes crime or crime causes disorganization, might be reciprocal

---

### CONCLUSION

Social Disorganization Theory proves crime concentrates in areas with high turnover, poverty, weak institutions, and absent social control mechanisms. Shaw and McKay's finding that crime persists despite ethnic succession demonstrates area characteristics, not people's characteristics, drive crime rates. Modern collective efficacy concept shows organized communities overcome even economic disadvantage through social cohesion and intervention willingness. Effective crime prevention requires strengthening communities, empowering residents, building collective efficacy, and improving physical environment rather than merely arresting individuals from problem areas.

---

## Q11. CRIMINOLOGY: SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES

**PYQ Frequency:** 5 (2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018) | **ROI:** 9/10

### DEFINITION

> Criminology = Scientific study of crime, criminals, criminal behavior, and criminal justice system.

**Etymology:** Latin "Crimen" (crime) + Greek "Logos" (study) - literally means study of crime as scientific discipline.

---

### SCOPE OF CRIMINOLOGY (6)

**1. Nature of Crime:**
- Definition, classification, types of crimes - statistics, trends, patterns, measurement methods used by agencies.

**2. Causes of Crime:**
- Individual factors: Biology (genes, brain), Psychology (personality, mental illness), Cognition (decision-making, reasoning)
- Social factors: Poverty, education, family structure, peer influence, subcultural factors affecting behavior
- Environmental factors: Neighborhood characteristics, social disorganization, opportunity structures for crime

**3. Criminal Behavior:**
- Why people commit crimes examining motivation, how criminal behavior develops over time and life course, patterns of offending including specialization, why people stop (desistance from crime)

**4. Criminal Justice System:**
- Police (law enforcement, investigation, arrest, community policing strategies)
- Courts (prosecution, trial, adjudication, sentencing decisions)
- Corrections (prisons, probation, parole, rehabilitation programs, community supervision)
- Analysis of system effectiveness, fairness, and needed reforms

**5. Crime Prevention:**
- Primary prevention before crime occurs targeting general population
- Secondary prevention through early intervention with at-risk individuals
- Tertiary prevention via rehabilitation of convicted offenders
- Evidence-based strategies and community programs

**6. Victimology:**
- Impact of crime on victims (physical, psychological, financial effects)
- Victim-offender relationship patterns and dynamics
- Victim rights, services, compensation programs
- Prevention of secondary victimization by system

---

### OBJECTIVES OF CRIMINOLOGY (5)

**1. Understanding Crime:**
- Analyze nature and extent accurately, study patterns and distributions, document societal impact systematically.

**2. Identifying Causes:**
- Determine factors leading to crime at individual, social, environmental levels - develop and test causal theories scientifically.

**3. Preventing Crime:**
- Develop evidence-based prevention strategies, implement effective policies and programs, address root causes identified through research.

**4. Reforming Criminals:**
- Rehabilitation and reintegration into society, reduce recidivism rates significantly, develop effective treatment addressing criminogenic needs.

**5. Protecting Society:**
- Ensure public safety and social order, balance punishment with rehabilitation appropriately, develop fair and effective justice system.

---

### INTERDISCIPLINARY NATURE (7)

| Science | Contribution to Criminology |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Psychology | Criminal mind, behavior, motivation, personality, mental illness understanding |
| Sociology | Social factors, group behavior, structures, institutions, cultural influences |
| Psychiatry | Mental illness-crime link, treatment of offenders, forensic assessment |
| Law | Legal framework, procedures, rights, due process requirements |
| Economics | Poverty-crime connection, cost-benefit analysis, economic theories |
| Biology | Genetics, brain function, hormones, evolutionary psychology perspectives |
| Anthropology | Cultural influences, cross-cultural crime patterns, traditional justice systems |

**Criminology draws from all these** to provide holistic understanding impossible with single discipline alone.

---

### CONCLUSION

Criminology as scientific interdisciplinary study encompasses six-part scope (nature, causes, behavior, justice system, prevention, victims) guided by five objectives (understanding, identifying causes, preventing, reforming, protecting). Drawing from psychology, sociology, law, biology, and other sciences enables comprehensive approach to complex crime phenomenon. Scientific methodology ensures policies based on evidence rather than mere intuition or tradition, leading to more effective and humane criminal justice responses.

---

---

## Q12. NEUTRALIZATION AND DRIFT THEORY

**PYQ Frequency:** 4 (2021, 2020, 2019, 2018) | **ROI:** 8/10

### INTRODUCTION

Sykes and Matza (1957) observed most delinquents feel guilt and drift in/out of crime. They use "neutralization techniques" to overcome guilt BEFORE committing crimes.

---

### KEY OBSERVATIONS (3)

1. Delinquents feel guilty (not rejecting values completely)
2. Admire law-abiding persons (don't want family victimized)
3. Delinquency is episodic (not always criminal, most age out)

**Conclusion:** NOT fully committed to deviant values

---

### CONCEPT OF DRIFT

**Definition:** Movement between conventional and criminal behavior

**Metaphor:** Like drifting on raft between two shores
- Not committed to crime
- Not committed to convention
- Move between both

**Implication:** Youth can drift IN and OUT of crime

---

### FIVE TECHNIQUES OF NEUTRALIZATION (3D-CA)

> Rationalizations used BEFORE crime to overcome guilt

---

#### **1. DENIAL OF RESPONSIBILITY**
- "It wasn't my fault"
- Blame external forces
- Examples: "I was drunk," "Friends made me"

#### **2. DENIAL OF INJURY**
- "Nobody really hurt"
- Minimize harm
- Examples: "Store has insurance," "He's rich"

#### **3. DENIAL OF VICTIM**
- "They deserved it"
- Victim becomes wrongdoer
- Examples: "He insulted me," "Rich exploit poor"

#### **4. CONDEMNATION OF CONDEMNERS**
- "Everyone corrupt, who are they to judge?"
- Attack accusers
- Examples: "Police take bribes," "Politicians steal"

#### **5. APPEAL TO HIGHER LOYALTIES**
- "Had to do it for gang/family"
- Loyalty to smaller group
- Examples: "Gang needed me," "Family first"

---

### HOW NEUTRALIZATION WORKS

```
Want to commit crime → Feel guilt → Use neutralization → Guilt overcome → Commit crime
```

**Key:** Used BEFORE crime to enable it, not just after as excuse

---

### POLICY IMPLICATIONS (4)

1. **Challenge rationalizations** - Show logical flaws
2. **Strengthen values** - Moral education
3. **Victim awareness** - Meet real victims
4. **Accountability** - Take responsibility, no excuses

---

### CONCLUSION

Neutralization techniques allow individuals to temporarily overcome guilt and commit crimes while maintaining self-image as good person. Five techniques—denial of responsibility, injury, and victim, condemnation of condemners, appeal to loyalties—enable crime by releasing moral constraints. Drift concept explains episodic nature of youth crime. Understanding these allows interventions challenging rationalizations and strengthening accountability.

## SECTION C: 5-MARK QUESTIONS (Quick Revision - 6)

---

## Q13. CRIME: DEFINITION AND ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS

**PYQ Frequency:** 5 (2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018) | **ROI:** 9/10

### **DEFINITION OF CRIME**

> **Crime** is an act or omission that constitutes an offense that may be prosecuted by the state and is punishable by law.

### Comprehensive Definition
- Violation of criminal law
- Harmful to society
- Prosecuted and punished by state
- Requires both act and mental element

---

### **ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF CRIME (6)**

---

#### **1. Actus Reus (Guilty Act)**
- Physical element of crime
- Actual criminal conduct or omission
- Must be voluntary act or omission
- External manifestation of criminal will

---

#### **2. Mens Rea (Guilty Mind)**
- Mental element of crime
- Criminal intent, knowledge, or recklessness
- State of mind during commission
- Guilty mind requirement

---

#### **3. Causation**
- Connection between act and harmful result
- Act must cause the harm directly
- Direct causal link required
- No intervening cause breaking chain

---

#### **4. Harm**
- Injury to person, property, or society
- Actual or potential damage
- Legally recognized harm
- Social interest violated

---

#### **5. Legality**
- Act must be prohibited by law
- No crime without law (nullum crimen sine lege)
- Law must exist before act committed
- Clear legal prohibition required

---

#### **6. Punishment**
- Prescribed penalty under law
- State sanctions for violation
- Range from fines to imprisonment
- Legal consequences specified

---

### **CONCLUSION**

Crime requires presence of all six essential elements: actus reus (guilty act), mens rea (guilty mind), causation, harm, legality, and punishment. Without these elements, conduct may be morally wrong but not criminal in legal sense. Both physical act and mental element must concur for criminal liability.

---

---

## Q14. FIVE TECHNIQUES OF NEUTRALIZATION

**PYQ Frequency:** 4 (2022, 2021, 2020, 2019) | **ROI:** 8/10

### **DEFINITION**

> **Techniques of Neutralization** = Rationalizations used BEFORE committing crime to overcome guilt and justify behavior temporarily.

**Developed by:** Gresham Sykes and David Matza (1957)

---

### **FIVE TECHNIQUES (3D-CA)**

---

#### **1. DENIAL OF RESPONSIBILITY**
- "It wasn't my fault, I had no choice"
- Blame external forces, circumstances
- Examples: "I was drunk," "Friends made me"
- **Effect:** Removes personal blame

---

#### **2. DENIAL OF INJURY**
- "Nobody really got hurt"
- Minimize harm done
- Examples: "Store has insurance," "He's rich"
- **Effect:** Reduces seriousness

---

#### **3. DENIAL OF VICTIM**
- "They deserved it"
- Victim becomes wrongdoer
- Examples: "He insulted me," "She asked for it"
- **Effect:** Crime becomes justice

---

#### **4. CONDEMNATION OF THE CONDEMNERS**
- "Everyone is corrupt, who are they to judge?"
- Attack accusers' credibility
- Examples: "Police take bribes," "Politicians are criminals"
- **Effect:** Deflects blame to others

---

#### **5. APPEAL TO HIGHER LOYALTIES**
- "I had to do it for my gang/family"
- Loyalty to smaller group over society
- Examples: "Gang needed me," "Family comes first"
- **Effect:** Crime becomes noble sacrifice

---

### **HOW IT WORKS**

```
Want to commit crime → Feel guilt → Use neutralization → Guilt overcome temporarily → Commit crime
```

**Key Point:** Used BEFORE crime to enable it, not just after as excuse.

---

### **CONCLUSION**

Five techniques—denial of responsibility, denial of injury, denial of victim, condemnation of condemners, and appeal to higher loyalties—allow individuals to temporarily overcome conventional values and commit crimes while maintaining self-image as basically good person. Understanding these techniques enables development of interventions challenging rationalizations and strengthening accountability.

## Q15. CLASSICAL VS POSITIVIST SCHOOL (HIGH PRIORITY)

**PYQ Frequency:** 4 (2022, 2021, 2020, 2019) | **ROI:** 8/10

### **KEY DISTINCTIONS (6)**

---

#### **1. Time Period**
- **Classical:** Mid-18th century (1764 onwards)
- **Positivist:** Late 19th century (1870s onwards)

---

#### **2. Focus**
- **Classical:** Crime (the criminal act itself)
- **Positivist:** Criminal (the person committing act)

---

#### **3. Free Will**
- **Classical:** Absolute free will - humans rationally choose to commit crime
- **Positivist:** Determinism - crime caused by factors beyond individual control

---

#### **4. Cause of Crime**
- **Classical:** Rational choice - weighing pleasure vs pain
- **Positivist:** Biological, psychological, social factors determine behavior

---

#### **5. Response**
- **Classical:** Punishment as deterrence - proportionate, certain, swift
- **Positivist:** Treatment and rehabilitation - individualized based on causes

---

#### **6. Method**
- **Classical:** Legal and philosophical approach, deductive reasoning
- **Positivist:** Scientific method - empirical observation, inductive reasoning

---

### **SUMMARY TABLE**

| Aspect | Classical | Positivist |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Focus | Crime | Criminal |
| Free Will | Yes | No (Determined) |
| Cause | Rational choice | Bio-psycho-social factors |
| Response | Punishment | Treatment |
| Method | Philosophy | Science |

---

### **CONCLUSION**

Classical School emphasized rational free will and deterrent punishment, while Positivist School introduced scientific determinism and rehabilitative treatment. Modern criminal justice systems blend both approaches, retaining Classical principles of legality and proportionality while using Positivist scientific methods and treatment orientation.

## Q16. FREUD'S ID-EGO-SUPEREGO THEORY (HIGH PRIORITY)

**PYQ Frequency:** 4 (2022, 2021, 2020, 2019) | **ROI:** 8/10

### **FREUD'S THREE-PART PERSONALITY STRUCTURE**

---

#### **1. THE ID**

**Nature:**
- Primitive part of personality
- Present at birth
- Completely unconscious

**Represents:**
- Unconscious biological drives
- Basic needs: food, water, sex, sleep
- Seeks immediate gratification

**Operating Principle:**
- **Pleasure Principle**
- "I want it NOW!"
- Immediate satisfaction demanded

---

#### **2. THE EGO**

**Nature:**
- Develops after Id
- Conscious and unconscious
- Mediator between Id and reality

**Function:**
- Compensates for Id's demands
- Guides actions realistically
- Remains within social boundaries
- Considers what is practical and acceptable

**Operating Principle:**
- **Reality Principle**
- "Let's be practical about this"
- Adapts Id's desires to reality

---

#### **3. THE SUPEREGO**

**Nature:**
- Force of self-criticism and conscience
- Moral component of personality
- Develops through socialization

**Development:**
- Internalizes moral standards from parents and society
- Incorporates values and ethics
- Learns right from wrong

**Function:**
- Controls Id's selfish impulses
- Guides Ego toward moral behavior
- Creates guilt when moral code violated

**Operating Principle:**
- **Morality Principle**
- "That's wrong!"
- Conscience and moral judgment

---

### **IMBALANCE AND CRIME**

#### How Imbalance Leads to Crime:

**Overdeveloped Id:**
- Strong primitive urges
- Weak Ego and Superego
- **Result:** Impulsive violent crimes

**Underdeveloped Superego:**
- No conscience or guilt
- **Result:** Psychopathic behavior

**Overdeveloped Superego:**
- Excessive guilt
- Needs punishment
- **Result:** Crime as self-punishment

---

### **CONCLUSION**

Freud's Id-Ego-Superego model explains personality structure. Crime results from imbalance among three components. Properly balanced personality with strong Ego mediating Id's desires according to Superego's moral guidance produces law-abiding behavior. Imbalance in any direction can lead to criminal behavior through different mechanisms.

## Q17. MERTON'S FIVE MODES OF ADAPTATION (HIGH PRIORITY)

**PYQ Frequency:** 4 (2021, 2020, 2019, 2018) | **ROI:** 8/10

### **MERTON'S FIVE MODES OF ADAPTATION**

---

#### **1. CONFORMITY** (✅ Goals | ✅ Means)
- Accept cultural goals AND accept institutional means
- Work hard legitimately to achieve success
- Most common adaptation
- **Result:** No crime

---

#### **2. INNOVATION** (✅ Goals | ❌ Means)
- Accept goals BUT reject means
- Use illegal means to achieve goals
- **MOST RELEVANT TO CRIME**
- Examples: Theft, fraud, drug dealing
- **Result:** Property crime, white-collar crime

---

#### **3. RITUALISM** (❌ Goals | ✅ Means)
- Reject goals BUT accept means
- Lower aspirations, follow rules rigidly
- Example: Low-ambition bureaucrat
- **Result:** Usually not criminal

---

#### **4. RETREATISM** (❌ Goals | ❌ Means)
- Reject both goals and means
- Withdraw from society completely
- Examples: Drug addicts, homeless
- **Result:** Drug-related crimes, vagrancy

---

#### **5. REBELLION** (🔄 Goals | 🔄 Means)
- Replace existing goals and means with new ones
- Want to change society fundamentally
- Examples: Revolutionaries, terrorists
- **Result:** Political violence

---

### **SUMMARY TABLE**

| Mode | Goals | Means | Crime Type | Example |
|------|-------|-------|------------|---------|
| Conformity | ✅ | ✅ | None | Student works hard |
| Innovation | ✅ | ❌ | **Property/WC** | Theft |
| Ritualism | ❌ | ✅ | Usually none | Bureaucrat |
| Retreatism | ❌ | ❌ | Drug-related | Addict |
| Rebellion | 🔄 | 🔄 | Political | Revolutionary |

---

### **CONCLUSION**

Merton's five modes explain different responses to strain between cultural goals and institutional means. Innovation mode (accepting goals but using illegal means) most relevant to explaining crime. Understanding modes helps identify which individuals most at risk for criminal behavior and why.

## Q18. FOUR ELEMENTS OF SOCIAL BOND (HIGH PRIORITY)

**PYQ Frequency:** 4 (2022, 2021, 2020, 2019) | **ROI:** 8/10

### **HIRSCHI'S FOUR ELEMENTS OF SOCIAL BOND (A-C-I-B)**

---

#### **1. ATTACHMENT**
- Emotional bond to others (parents, teachers, friends)
- Sensitivity to their opinions
- Don't want to disappoint them
- **Effect:** Conform to avoid hurting relationships

---

#### **2. COMMITMENT**
- Investment in conventional activities (education, career)
- Rational stake in conformity
- Something to lose if commit crime
- **Effect:** Too risky to commit crime - too much at stake

---

#### **3. INVOLVEMENT**
- Time and energy spent in conventional activities
- Busy with school, work, hobbies
- "Idle hands are devil's workshop"
- **Effect:** No time or opportunity for crime

---

#### **4. BELIEF**
- Acceptance of conventional moral code
- Belief that rules should be obeyed
- Internalized morality
- **Effect:** Conform because it's morally right

---

### **HOW BONDS PREVENT CRIME**

#### Strong Bonds:
- Attachment → Don't hurt loved ones
- Commitment → Too much to lose
- Involvement → No time for crime
- Belief → Crime is wrong
- **Result:** CONFORMITY

#### Weak Bonds:
- No attachment → Don't care about others
- No commitment → Nothing to lose
- No involvement → Free time and boredom
- No belief → Law not important
- **Result:** FREE TO COMMIT CRIME

---

### **CONCLUSION**

Hirschi's four elements of social bond—attachment, commitment, involvement, and belief—explain why people conform to law. When bonds are strong, people are restrained from crime. When bonds are weak or broken, people are free to commit crime. Theory emphasizes strengthening social bonds as crime prevention strategy.
