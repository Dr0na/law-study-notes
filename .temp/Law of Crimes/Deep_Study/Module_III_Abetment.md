## 🔑 3 Forms of Abetment

The law recognizes **THREE distinct forms** by which a person may abet an offence:

### 1️⃣ **ABETMENT BY INSTIGATION**

#### 📘 Definition

**Instigation** means to goad, urge, provoke, incite, encourage or stimulate a person to do an act or omission.

#### 🔹 Characteristics of Instigation

**Nature**:
- Active suggestion or stimulation
- Incitement to commit offence
- Creating in the mind of person instigated the idea to commit offence

**Methods of Instigation**:
- Direct suggestion
- Hints
- Insinuation
- Encouragement
- Indirect statements that provoke

**📌 Important**: Mere advice or suggestion without active incitement may NOT be instigation

#### 🔹 Illustrations

**Illustration 1**:
- A instigates B to murder C
- B refuses to do so
- A has committed offence of abetment by instigation
- Liability exists even if B refuses

**Illustration 2**:
- A says to B "C has wronged you, teach him a lesson"
- Such hints with intention that B attacks C
- This is instigation

**Illustration 3**:
- A falsely tells B that C has been speaking ill of B's family
- Knowing this will provoke B to assault C
- This is abetment by instigation

#### 🔹 Key Requirements

**3 Requirements for Instigation**:

1️⃣ **Active Suggestion or Incitement**
- Must be some positive act of inciting
- Mere passive presence insufficient

2️⃣ **Intention to Instigate**
- Abettor must have intention that crime be committed
- Knowledge that person may commit crime

3️⃣ **Instigation Must Precede Act**
- Must occur before or at time of offence
- Cannot instigate after fact

---

### 2️⃣ **ABETMENT BY CONSPIRACY**

#### 📘 Definition

**Conspiracy to abet** means when two or more persons engage themselves by agreement to abet the doing of a thing.

#### 🔹 Characteristics of Conspiracy

- Agreement to commit or cause commission of offence
- Common intention to achieve unlawful object

**Essential Elements**:
- Agreement (express or implied)
- Between two or more persons
- To do or cause to be done illegal act or legal act by illegal means

**Distinction from Criminal Conspiracy**:
- Abetment by conspiracy: Conspiracy to abet commission of offence
- Criminal conspiracy (Section 61): Agreement itself is offence

#### 🔹 4 Requirements for Conspiracy to Abet

- Express or implied
- Need not be in any particular form
- Can be inferred from circumstances

2️⃣ **Two or More Persons**

- They plan the act together
- All three are guilty of abetment by conspiracy
- Even before actual robbery is committed

**Illustration 2**:
- A and B conspire to cheat C
- A executes the plan alone
- Both A and B are liable
- B is abettor by conspiracy even without direct participation

**Illustration 3**:
- Several persons agree to wage war against Government
- They make preparations
- All are guilty of abetment by conspiracy to wage war

---

### 3️⃣ **ABETMENT BY INTENTIONAL AID**

#### 📘 Definition

**Intentional Aid** means intentionally aiding a person in the commission of an offence by any act or illegal omission.

#### 🔹 Characteristics of Intentional Aid

- Must be intentional, not accidental

**Forms of Aid**:
- Providing weapons
- Providing information
- Removing obstacles
- Keeping watch
- Providing transportation
- Supplying tools/instruments

1️⃣ **Positive Act or Illegal Omission**
- Must do something OR fail to do something (when legally bound)
- Mere passive presence insufficient

2️⃣ **Intentional**
- Aid must be given knowingly and intentionally
- Accidental help not abetment

3️⃣ **To Facilitate Commission**
- Aid must actually assist in commission of offence

#### 🔹 Illustrations

**Illustration 1**:
