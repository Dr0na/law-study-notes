## 📝 Understanding Homicide

### ⚖️ Etymology and Meaning

**Homicide** is derived from the Latin words:
- **Homo** = Man
- **Caedere** = To cut or kill

**Therefore**: Homicide means **the killing of a human being**

### 🔹 Types of Homicide

**Not all homicides are culpable (punishable)**. Law distinguishes between:

1️⃣ **Lawful Homicide** (Not Culpable)
- Killing in self-defense
- Killing in pursuance of lawful authority (e.g., execution)
- Killing by reason of mistake of fact
- Death caused by accident or misfortune
- Death while doing an act in good faith without criminal intention

2️⃣ **Unlawful Homicide** (Culpable)
- Culpable Homicide not amounting to Murder
- Culpable Homicide amounting to Murder

---

## 📖 Section 100: Culpable Homicide (BNS 2023)

### ⚖️ Definition

**Previously Section 299 of IPC**

**Section 100 BNS**: "Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide."

### 🧩 Essential Elements of Culpable Homicide

#### 1️⃣ **Physical Element (Actus Reus)**

**Causing Death**:
- There must be actual death of a human being
- Death must be the result of the accused's act

**Nature of Act**:
- The act should be of such nature that it would put someone's life in peril
- The act should damage someone's life to such extent that the person would die
- Usually involves a high degree of violence against the person

**Examples of Acts**:
- Stabbing a person in vital organs
- Shooting someone at point-blank range
- Administering poison
- Starving someone (may not involve direct violence but causes death)

#### 2️⃣ **Mental Element (Mens Rea) - Three Forms**

**Form A: Intention of Causing Death**

The act is committed with the **direct intention of causing death**.

**Illustration**:
- A pushes B from a cliff deliberately with the idea that B will fall and die
- A shoots B aiming at B's heart with intention to kill

**Distinction**:
- Pushing someone for a joke → person falls and dies = No intention (Not CH)
- Pushing someone deliberately to cause death = Intention present (CH)

**Form B: Intention of Causing Bodily Injury Likely to Cause Death**

The accused intends to cause such **bodily injury as is likely to cause death**.

**Two Types of Situations**:

1. **Direct Bodily Injury Causing Death**:
   - Bludgeoning someone on the head repeatedly with a blunt instrument
   - The injury itself is of such nature that it causes death

2. **Bodily Injury + Intervening Events**:
   - There are injuries, and there are intervening events between injuries and death
   - Provided the delay is not too blatant
   - Must prove injuries were administered with intention of causing death

**Form C: Knowledge that the Act is Likely to Cause Death**

The accused has **knowledge** that the act will likely cause death.

**Distinction from Intention**:
- **Knowledge**: Person may not intend to kill but knows the act will likely take life
- **Intention**: Person positively wants to cause death

**Illustration**:
- A doctor uses an infected syringe knowingly on a patient
- The act itself will not directly cause death
- But doctor has knowledge that his actions will lead to death by terminal disease

## 📖 Section 101: Murder (BNS 2023)

### ⚖️ Definition

**Previously Section 300 of IPC**

**Relationship Between Culpable Homicide and Murder**:

Section 101 states that **"culpable homicide is murder"** in certain specific situations.

**Two Fundamental Conclusions**:
1. For an act to be classified as **murder**, it must first meet all conditions of **culpable homicide**
2. **All murders are culpable homicides**, but **all culpable homicides are NOT murders**

**Visual Representation**:
```
┌───────────────────────────────┐
│     CULPABLE HOMICIDE         │  ← Genus (Broader Category)
│  ┌─────────────────────────┐  │
│  │       MURDER            │  │  ← Species (Specific Type)
│  └─────────────────────────┘  │
└───────────────────────────────┘
```

### 🔥 4 Situations When Culpable Homicide is MURDER

#### 1️⃣ **Intention of Causing Death**

**Requirement**: Act done with the **intention of causing death**

**Degree of Intention**: Very high - there must be positive intention to cause death, not merely harm or grievous hurt.

**Examples**:
- Shooting someone at point-blank range
- Stabbing someone in the heart
- Hanging someone by the neck until death
- Strapping a bomb on someone
- Administering deadly poison

**Illustration** (from Section 101):
- A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits **murder**.

#### 2️⃣ **Intention to Cause Bodily Injury Sufficient in Ordinary Course to Cause Death**

**Requirement**: 
- Act done with intention of causing **such bodily injury** as the offender **knows** to be likely to cause death
- The bodily injury intended is **sufficient in ordinary course of nature** to cause death

**Two Conditions**:
1. The bodily injury must be inflicted with intention of causing death
2. The bodily injury, in ordinary course of events, leads to death

**Special Knowledge Cases**:
- Offender has special knowledge about victim's condition
- Causes harm in such manner which causes death
- Example: Person knows victim is hemophiliac and causes injury that leads to death

#### 3️⃣ **Intention to Cause Bodily Injury That Person is Likely to Die From**

**Requirement**: Intention to cause bodily injury, and the bodily injury intended is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.

**Analysis**: This covers situations where:
- There is intention to cause specific bodily injury
- That bodily injury ordinarily causes death
- Even if death was not directly intended, the nature of injury makes it murder

#### 4️⃣ **Imminently Dangerous Act - Knowledge It Will Probably Cause Death**

**Requirement**: 
- Person does an act so **imminently dangerous** that it must in **all probability** cause death
- OR cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death
- Act done **without any excuse** for incurring risk of causing death or injury

**Three Elements**:
1. Commission of an **inherently dangerous act**
2. **Knowledge** that the act will in all probability cause death or bodily injury causing death
3. Act done **without any excuse**

**Illustration**:
- A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons
- Knowledge that death will probably follow
- This is **murder**

## 🛡️ 5 EXCEPTIONS: Culpable Homicide NOT Amounting to Murder

### **Section 101 BNS - Five Exceptions**

Even though all conditions of murder are satisfied, the offense is reduced to **Culpable Homicide not amounting to Murder** in five specific situations:

---

### **Exception 1: Grave and Sudden Provocation**

**Provision**: Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, while deprived of the power of self-control by **grave and sudden provocation**, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation.

#### 📌 **Conditions**

1️⃣ **Provocation must be GRAVE**
- Must be serious enough to deprive person of self-control
- Not a trivial or minor insult

2️⃣ **Provocation must be SUDDEN**
- There must be no scope for premeditation
- No time to cool down
- Immediate response to provocation

3️⃣ **Not Self-Invited**
- Provocation must not be sought or provoked by the accused
- Cannot use it as excuse to commit planned killing

4️⃣ **Person Killed Must Be**
- The person who gave the provocation, OR
- By mistake or accident some other person

#### ❌ **Limitations**

**Provocation is NOT an excuse if**:
- Given by anything done in **obedience to law**

- Given by anything done in **lawful exercise of right of private defense**
- In case of **public servant**, provocation given by anything done or attempted in lawful discharge of duty
- Given voluntarily by offender as **excuse for killing**

#### 📖 **Illustrations**

**Example 1** (Murder - Not Sudden):
- A returns from office and sees his wife B in compromising position with Z in bedroom
- A leaves the room and kills Z **next day**
- This is **MURDER**, not Culpable Homicide
- **Reason**: A had sufficient time to cool down his anger - not sudden

**Example 2** (Culpable Homicide - Sudden):
- A returns from office and sees his wife B in compromising position with Z
- A immediately shoots Z in fit of rage
- This is **Culpable Homicide not amounting to Murder**
- **Reason**: Grave and sudden provocation

**Example 3** (Murder - Self-Invited):
- A provokes Z intentionally
- Z slaps A in response
- A then kills Z claiming provocation
- This is **MURDER** - provocation was self-invited

---

### **Exception 2: Private Defense in Good Faith**

**Provision**: Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, in the exercise in **good faith** of the **right of private defense** of person or property, exceeds the power given by law and causes death.

#### 📌 **Conditions**

1️⃣ Must be exercising **right of private defense**
2️⃣ Must act in **good faith**
3️⃣ Must **exceed** the right without premeditation
4️⃣ Must exceed without intention of doing more harm than necessary

#### 📖 **Illustration**

**Example** (Culpable Homicide):
- Z attempts to horsewhip A (not causing grievous hurt)
- A draws out a pistol
- Z persists in assault
- A, believing in good faith he cannot prevent being horsewhipped by any other means, shoots Z dead
- A has NOT committed **Murder**, but only **Culpable Homicide**
- **Reason**: Exceeded right of private defense in good faith

**If it were Murder**:
- If A had time to think and deliberately shot Z knowing it was excessive force
- If A acted with malice, not good faith

---

### **Exception 3: Public Servant Exceeding Powers**

**Provision**: Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender is a **public servant** or person assisting a public servant, and exceeds the powers given by law while acting in **good faith** for advancement of public justice.

#### 📌 **Conditions**

1️⃣ Person must be **public servant** OR assisting public servant
2️⃣ Must act for **advancement of public justice**
3️⃣ Must believe in **good faith** that act was lawful and necessary
4️⃣ Must **exceed** powers given by law
5️⃣ No ill-will towards person harmed

#### 📖 **Illustration**

**Example**:
- A police officer, attempting to arrest a dangerous criminal
- Criminal resists violently
- Officer uses more force than necessary and kills the criminal
- If officer acted in good faith believing it necessary: **Culpable Homicide**
- If officer had malice or knew force was excessive: **Murder**

---

### **Exception 4: Sudden Fight**

**Provision**: Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed **without premeditation** in a **sudden fight** in the **heat of passion** upon a sudden quarrel.

#### 📌 **Conditions**

1️⃣ **No premeditation** - not planned in advance

#### 📖 **Illustration**

**Example** (Culpable Homicide):
- A and Z are neighbors
- Sudden quarrel arises over parking space
- In heat of passion, A pushes Z
- Z falls, hits head and dies
- No premeditation, no undue advantage: **Culpable Homicide not Murder**

**If it were Murder**:
- If A had planned to pick fight with Z
- If A took undue advantage (had weapon, Z unarmed)
- If A acted in cruel manner

---

### **Exception 5: Consent - Person Above 18 Years**

**Provision**: Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being **above eighteen years of age**, suffers death or takes risk of death with **own consent**.

#### 📌 **Conditions**

1️⃣ Deceased must be **above 18 years of age**
2️⃣ Deceased gave **consent** to death or risk of death
3️⃣ Consent must be **voluntary**

**Important**: If person is below 18 years, consent is invalid - it will be **Murder**

#### 📖 **Illustration**

**Example 1** (Culpable Homicide):
- A, by instigation, voluntarily causes Y (aged 20) to commit suicide
- Y gave consent and was above 18 years
- This is **Culpable Homicide not amounting to Murder**

**Example 2** (Murder):
- A, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z (aged 16) to commit suicide
- Z was **under eighteen years of age**
- Even though Z consented, A has committed **MURDER**
- **Reason**: On account of Z's youth, Z was incapable of giving valid consent

## ⚖️ Distinction: Culpable Homicide vs Murder

### 🔑 Key Principle

**"The distinction between Culpable Homicide and Murder is only a difference in DEGREES of intention and knowledge."**

- **Greater degree** of intention and knowledge → **MURDER**
- **Lesser degree** of intention and knowledge → **CULPABLE HOMICIDE**

### 📊 Comparative Analysis

| **Aspect** | **Culpable Homicide** | **Murder** |
|------------|----------------------|------------|
| **Genus/Species** | Genus (Broader) | Species (Specific) |
| **Intention** | Intention of causing bodily injury **likely** to cause death | Intention of causing bodily injury **sufficient in ordinary course** to cause death |
| **Knowledge** | Knowledge that act is **likely** to cause death | Knowledge that act is **so imminently dangerous** that it **must in all probability** cause death |
| **Degree** | Lesser degree of probability | Higher degree of probability/certainty |
| **Seriousness** | Less serious | More serious/heinous |
| **Punishment** | Imprisonment up to life or shorter term | Death penalty or life imprisonment |

### 📌 Requirement of INTENTION

#### **In Culpable Homicide**:
- Offender should have intention of causing **such bodily injury as is likely to result in death**
- So long as person is inflicting injuries intentionally, requisite mental element is present
- Court decides if injuries were **likely** to result in death
- Does NOT require person to know these injuries **will** result in death

#### **In Murder**:
- Person intentionally causes bodily injury **sufficient in ordinary course of nature to cause death**
- Higher degree of certainty required
- Person must know injury is of such nature that it will cause death

### 📌 Requirement of KNOWLEDGE

#### **In Culpable Homicide**:
- Knowledge that act is **likely** to result in death
- Lower degree of probability

#### **In Murder**:
- Knowledge that act is **so imminently dangerous** that it **must in all probability cause death**
- Higher degree of certainty

### 🔍 Supreme Court Interpretation

#### **Kesar Singh v. State of Haryana**

**Held**: The distinction between **knowledge** and **intention** is a difference of degrees.

**Knowledge**:
- Means consciousness, realization, or understanding
- A bare state of conscious awareness of certain facts
- Mind might remain supine or inactive

**Intention**:
- Connotes a conscious state where mental faculties are roused into activity
- Mental faculties are summed up into action
- Directed toward a particular and specific end
- Human mind conceives and perceives the end before itself

#### **Rampal Singh v. State of U.P.**

**Held**:
1. **Section 100 (CH)** emphasizes on **"intention"** in former part and **"knowledge"** in latter part
2. Both are positive mental attitudes of different degrees
3. Mental element in Culpable Homicide is **intention and knowledge**
4. **Section 101 (Murder)** deals with murder but does not clearly define it
5. **Culpable Homicide is the genus**, **Murder is its species**
6. **All murders are culpable homicides**, but **all culpable homicides are not murders**

### 📊 Practical Differences

1️⃣ **Degree of Probability**
- **Murder**: Heinous crime or very dangerous act that causes **only death**, without any other result
- **Culpable Homicide**: Act leaves victim alive with grievous hurt, with **chance of escaping death**

2️⃣ **Sequence**
- Every murder is committed after committing culpable homicide
- But every culpable homicide does not amount to murder
- Murder is an **aggravated form** of culpable homicide

3️⃣ **Legal Effect**
- Existence of one ingredient of Section 101 → Crime becomes **Murder**
- Exceptions to murder → Crime becomes **Culpable Homicide not amounting to Murder**

4️⃣ **Certainty of Death**
- **Culpable Homicide**: Offender not certain about death of victim - degree of probability is **low**
- **Murder**: Offender has certainty that act will surely cause death - degree of probability is **high**

---

## 📖 Important Case Laws

### 1️⃣ **K.M. Nanavati v. State of Maharashtra** (1962)

**Facts**:
- Commander Nanavati (Naval officer) discovered his wife having affair with Prem Ahuja
- Wife confessed to the affair
- Nanavati went to Ahuja's flat and shot him dead
- Claimed grave and sudden provocation

**Issue**: Whether killing was under grave and sudden provocation (Exception 1)?

**Held**:
- **Conviction for Murder upheld**
- Provocation was NOT sudden - there was time gap between discovery and killing
- Nanavati had time to cool down (drove to office, collected revolver, drove to flat)
- Actions showed premeditation, not sudden passion
- Exception 1 NOT applicable

**Principle**: For Exception 1, provocation must be sudden with no time for premeditation.

---

### 2️⃣ **Virsa Singh v. State of Punjab** (1958)

**Facts**:
- Accused gave one spear blow on left side of victim
- Spear pierced through and ruptured liver and both kidneys
- Victim died after 3-4 days

**Issue**: Whether it was Murder or Culpable Homicide?

**Held**:
- **Conviction for Murder under Section 300 (3rd clause) upheld**
- Injury was sufficient in ordinary course of nature to cause death
- Intention to cause that specific bodily injury which caused death

**Principle**: 
- If bodily injury is intended AND that injury is sufficient in ordinary course to cause death → Murder
- Must prove: (1) Bodily injury present (2) Nature of injury (3) Injury was intended (4) Injury sufficient to cause death in ordinary course

---

### 3️⃣ **State of Andhra Pradesh v. R. Punnayya** (1977)

**Facts**:
- Accused set fire to hut in which victims were sleeping
- Three persons died

**Issue**: Murder or Culpable Homicide?

**Held**:
- **Murder under 4th clause of Section 300**
- Act of setting fire to inhabited hut was imminently dangerous
- Must in all probability cause death
- No excuse for incurring risk

**Principle**: Act so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death = Murder under 4th clause.

### 4️⃣ **Surinder Kumar v. State of Haryana** (2012)

**Facts**:
- Lovers from same village, but different castes
- Families opposed relationship
- Both consumed poison together (suicide pact)

- Falls under Exception 5 to Section 300
- Convicted under Section 299 + Section 306 (Abetment of Suicide)

**Principle**: Exception 5 applicable when person above 18 years takes risk of death with own consent.

---

### 5️⃣ **Darshan Singh v. State of Punjab** (2010)

**Facts**:
- Sudden quarrel between accused and deceased
- Fight in heat of passion
- Accused stabbed deceased with knife
