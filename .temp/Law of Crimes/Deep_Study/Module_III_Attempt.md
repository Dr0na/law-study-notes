## 📝 Understanding Inchoate Crimes

### ⚖️ Definition of Inchoate

**Inchoate** means **incomplete** or **anticipatory**.

**Inchoate Crimes** are offenses that involve acts toward committing another crime but fall short of actually completing the intended crime.

### 🔹 Types of Inchoate Crimes

**Three Main Categories**:
1. **Attempt** (Section 62 BNS)
2. **Conspiracy** (Section 61 BNS)
3. **Abetment** (Sections 45-60 BNS)

**Rationale for Punishment**: Even though the intended crime is not completed, the law punishes these acts because:
- They demonstrate criminal intent
- They pose danger to society
- They involve steps toward completing a crime
- Prevention is better than punishment after completion

---

## 📖 Meaning of Attempt

### ⚖️ Definition

The word **'attempt'** is **not defined** in the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita or Indian Penal Code.

**According to Oxford Dictionary**:
"Attempt" means **"earnest and conscientious activity intended to do or accomplish something"**

**Legal Understanding**:
Attempt is the **direct movement** toward the commission of a crime after the preparations are made, which falls short of actual completion of the intended crime.

## 🎯 4 Stages of Crime

Every commission of a crime passes through **four distinct stages**:

```
STAGE 1          STAGE 2          STAGE 3          STAGE 4
   ↓                ↓                ↓                ↓
INTENTION  →  PREPARATION  →   ATTEMPT   →  ACCOMPLISHMENT
(Mental)      (Preparing)      (Acting)      (Completion)
```

### **Stage 1: INTENTION**

**Nature**: Purely mental stage

**Characteristics**:
- Formation of criminal intent in the mind
- Desire to commit a crime
- No external manifestation

**Punishability**: **NOT PUNISHABLE**

**Reason**: 
- Law does not punish mere thoughts
- "Cogitationis poenam nemo patitur" - No one is punished for thoughts
- Difficult to prove what is in someone's mind
- Everyone has fleeting criminal thoughts sometimes

**Example**:
- A thinks of stealing B's car
- A merely desires to commit theft
- No overt act done
- NOT punishable

---

### **Stage 2: PREPARATION**

**Nature**: Taking steps to commit the crime

**Characteristics**:
- Arranging means and devising measures
- Collecting tools, weapons, or instruments
- Planning the crime
- Still remote from actual commission

**Punishability**: **GENERALLY NOT PUNISHABLE**

**Exception**: Some special offenses punish preparation:
- Preparation to wage war against Government (Section 152 BNS)
- Preparation to commit dacoity
- Counterfeiting coins or government stamps

**Reason for Non-Punishment**:
- Too remote from actual crime
- Difficult to prove criminal intent
- Many innocent acts could be confused with preparation
- Person may still change mind

**Examples of Preparation**:
1. A buys a gun intending to kill B
   - This is preparation, not attempt
   - NOT punishable (unless express provision)

2. A collects materials to make counterfeit currency
   - This is preparation
   - But specifically made punishable by express provision

3. A prepares with a hammer to break a box to steal jewels
   - But does nothing to break the box
   - This is mere preparation
   - NOT punishable under Section 62

---

### **Stage 3: ATTEMPT**

**Nature**: Direct movement toward commission of crime

**Characteristics**:
- Goes beyond preparation
- Overt act done toward commission
- Direct step taken to commit the crime
- Crime not completed due to some reason

**Punishability**: **PUNISHABLE** under Section 62 BNS

**Requirements**:
- Must do some act toward commission
- Act must be proximate to the intended crime
- Not mere preparation

**Examples of Attempt**:
1. A makes an attempt to steal jewels by breaking open a box
   - Finds after opening that there are no jewels
   - This is ATTEMPT (not mere preparation)
   - PUNISHABLE under Section 62

2. A attempts to pick pocket of Z
   - Thrusts hand into Z's pocket
   - Fails because Z has nothing in pocket
   - This is ATTEMPT
   - PUNISHABLE under Section 62

3. A points loaded gun at B with intention to kill
   - Gun misfires or B escapes
   - This is ATTEMPT to murder
   - PUNISHABLE

---

### **Stage 4: ACCOMPLISHMENT**

**Nature**: Successful completion of crime

**Characteristics**:
- All elements of the offense are satisfied
- Intended result is achieved
- Crime is complete

**Punishability**: **FULLY PUNISHABLE** under relevant provision for that offense

**Example**:
- A shoots B with intention to kill
- B dies
- Crime of murder is complete
- Punishable under Section 103 BNS (Murder)

---

## ⚖️ CRITICAL DISTINCTION: Preparation vs Attempt

### 🔑 The Most Important Question in Criminal Law

**"Where does preparation end and attempt begin?"**

This is one of the most difficult questions in criminal law with no clear-cut answer.

### 📊 Tests to Distinguish Preparation from Attempt

#### **1️⃣ Proximity Test (Most Common)**

**Principle**: An act constitutes an attempt if it is **proximate** (immediately connected) to the intended crime, not remote.

**Application**: 
- If act is close to completing the crime → ATTEMPT
- If act is still remote from completion → PREPARATION

#### **2️⃣ Unequivocal Act Test**

**Principle**: An act is an attempt if it **unequivocally** (clearly and unmistakably) demonstrates criminal intent.

**Application**: A neutral observer witnessing the act should be able to say the person is attempting to commit a specific crime.

#### **3️⃣ Last Act Test (Rejected)**

**Principle** (No longer accepted): Only the last act before completion is attempt.

**Problem**: This test is too narrow and impractical.

**Example**: Under this test, pointing gun at victim would not be attempt because pulling trigger is the last act. This is unreasonable.

#### **4️⃣ Series of Acts Test**

**Principle**: An act is attempt if it forms part of a **series of acts** which would constitute actual commission if not interrupted.

**Application**: Look at the entire course of conduct, not isolated act.

### 📋 Comparative Table: Preparation vs Attempt

| **Aspect** | **PREPARATION** | **ATTEMPT** |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Nature** | Arranging means | Direct movement toward crime |
| **Proximity** | Remote from crime | Proximate to crime |
| **Intent Manifestation** | Ambiguous | Unequivocal |
| **Stage** | Before commencing crime | During commission of crime |
| **Punishability** | Generally NOT punishable | PUNISHABLE (Section 62) |
| **Interruption** | Can easily withdraw | Difficult to withdraw |
| **Example** | Buying poison to kill | Administering poison |

---

### 📖 Illustrations: Preparation vs Attempt

| **Scenario** | **Stage** | **Reason** |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| A buys a gun to kill B | PREPARATION | Merely arranging means |
| A loads the gun and keeps it ready | PREPARATION | Still remote from actual killing |
| A goes to B's house with loaded gun | BORDERLINE | Depends on circumstances |
| A points loaded gun at B | ATTEMPT | Proximate act, unequivocal intent |
| A pulls trigger but gun misfires | ATTEMPT | Act toward commission done |
| A shoots and kills B | ACCOMPLISHMENT | Crime completed |

---

## 📖 Section 62 BNS: Punishment for Attempt

### ⚖️ Provision

**Section 62 BNS** (Previously Section 511 IPC):

"Whoever attempts to commit an offence punishable by this Code with **imprisonment for life or imprisonment**, or to cause such an offence to be committed, and in such attempt **does any act towards the commission** of the offence, shall, where **no express provision is made** by this Code for the punishment of such attempt, be punished with imprisonment of any description provided for the offence, for a term which may extend to **one-half of the imprisonment** for life or, as the case may be, one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for that offence, or with such fine as is provided for the offence, or with both."

---

### 🧩 Essential Ingredients of Section 62

#### **1️⃣ Offence Punishable with Imprisonment**

**Requirement**: The intended offense must be punishable with:
- Imprisonment for life, OR
- Imprisonment for a term

**NOT Covered**:
- ❌ Offenses punishable with **death only**
- ❌ Offenses punishable with **fine only**

**Reason**: Section 62 prescribes punishment as half of imprisonment. Death cannot be halved, and attempt for minor offenses (fine only) is not serious enough.

**Examples**:
- ✅ Attempt to commit murder (punishable with life/death) → Section 62 applies
- ✅ Attempt to commit theft (punishable with imprisonment) → Section 62 applies
- ❌ Attempt to commit defamation (may be fine only) → Section 62 may not apply

---

#### **2️⃣ Does Any Act Toward Commission of Offense**

**Requirement**: Accused must have **done some act** toward commission of the main offense.

**Key Points**:
- Not mere intention or preparation
- Must be an **overt act**
- Act must be toward commission, not remote
- Need not be the **penultimate act** (last act before completion)
- Must be an act **during the course** of committing offense

**Test**: Whether the act shows that the accused has crossed the line from preparation to attempt.

**Examples**:

**✅ Act Toward Commission (Attempt)**:
1. Breaking open box to steal jewels (even if box is empty)
2. Thrusting hand into pocket to pick (even if pocket is empty)
3. Applying for exam with forged documents (attempt to cheat)
4. Administering poison (even if insufficient quantity)

**❌ NOT Act Toward Commission (Mere Preparation)**:
1. Buying poison with intent to kill
2. Collecting tools to commit burglary
3. Planning a crime
4. Preparing application but not submitting it

---

#### **3️⃣ No Express Provision for Punishment**

**Requirement**: There must be **no express provision** in the Code specifically punishing the attempt.

**Reason**: Section 62 is a **residuary provision** (general provision that applies when specific provision absent).

**When Section 62 Does NOT Apply**:
- If there is express provision for attempt in BNS, that provision applies
- Section 62 is excluded

**Examples of Express Provisions**:

**Express Provision Present** (Section 62 NOT applicable):
1. Attempt to murder → Section 109 BNS (specific provision exists)
2. Attempt to commit suicide → Was Section 309 IPC (now decriminalized)
3. Attempt to wage war → Section 148 BNS (specific provision)
4. Attempt to robbery → Section 312 BNS (specific provision)

**No Express Provision** (Section 62 applicable):
1. Attempt to commit theft (no specific section for attempt to theft)
2. Attempt to cheat (no specific section for attempt to cheat)
3. Attempt to commit criminal breach of trust

## 🏛️ Important Case Laws

### 1️⃣ **Abhayanand Mishra v. State of Bihar** AIR 1961 SC 1698

#### **Facts**:
- Appellant applied to Patna University for permission to appear at M.A. Examination
- Represented that he was a graduate (B.A. degree in 1951)
- Represented that he had been teaching in a school
- Attached **bogus certificates** (forged documents)
- University gave permission and issued **admit-card**
- Before examination, University discovered the forged application

#### **Issue**:
Whether appellant was guilty of **'attempt to cheat'** the University under Section 415 IPC?

#### **Arguments by Appellant**:
1. What he did was just **preparation**, not attempt to cheat
2. Admit-card was not **property** and had no pecuniary value
3. He did not go beyond stage of preparation

#### **Held by Supreme Court**:

**Definition of Attempt**:
A person commits the offense of **'attempt to commit a particular offense'** when:
1. He **intends** to commit that particular offense, AND
2. He, having made preparations and with intention to commit the offense, **does an act toward its commission**
3. Such an act **need not be the penultimate act** toward commission
4. But must be **an act during the course** of committing that offense

**Application to Facts**:
1. Appellant did **deceive** the University
   - Dishonest concealment of facts is deception
   - Thus cheating under Section 415 IPC

2. Admit-card is **'property'**
   - Has immense value to a candidate
   - Not necessary to have pecuniary value only

3. He went **beyond preparation**
   - Preparation was complete when he prepared the application
   - **The moment he dispatched it**, he entered realm of **attempting to commit cheating**
   - He **did succeed** in deceiving University and inducing it to issue admit-card
   - He failed to get it and sit for exam because something beyond his control (University discovered fraud)

**Conviction**: Attempt to cheat - UPHELD

#### **Principles Established**:

1️⃣ **Preparation Ends When Act Toward Commission Begins**
- Preparing application = Preparation
- Dispatching application = Attempt

2️⃣ **Penultimate Act Not Required**
- Need not be last act before completion
- Any act during course of commission is sufficient

3️⃣ **Impossibility No Defense**
- Even if crime cannot be completed due to external factors
- Attempt is still punishable

4️⃣ **Property Need Not Have Pecuniary Value**
- Admit-card is property for purpose of cheating
- Has immense value to candidate

### 2️⃣ **Satvir Singh v. State of Punjab** AIR 2001 SC 2828

#### **Facts**:
- Accused asked wife/victim to go and commit suicide
- Act drove her to proceed to railway track for ending her life
- Question: Is this attempt punishable under Section 511 IPC?

#### **Issue**:
Whether Section 511 IPC (Attempt) applies when act is expressly covered under another section?

#### **Held**:

**Ingredients of Section 511**:
1. Offender should have **done some act** toward commission of main offense
2. Such attempt is **not expressly covered** as penal provision elsewhere in Code

**Section 498A IPC** (Cruelty):
- Makes cruelty as punishable offense
- Explanation includes: "Any willful conduct which is of such nature as is **likely to drive woman to commit suicide**"
- This is **expressly made punishable**

**Conclusion**:
- When act is expressly made punishable under Section 498A
- Act stands lifted out of purview of Section 511
- Section 511 does NOT apply

**Principle**: **Section 511 is residuary provision** - applies only when no express provision exists.

---

### 3️⃣ **Malkiat Singh v. State of Punjab** AIR 1970 SC 713

#### **Facts**:
- Accused fired gunshot at victim
- Victim escaped unhurt
- Question: Attempt to murder or attempt to cause hurt?

#### **Held**:

**Test for Attempt**:
To determine whether act is attempt, court must examine:
1. **Intention** of accused
2. **Nature of act** done
3. **Circumstances** in which act was done

**Application**:
- Firing gunshot at person shows intention to kill
- This is **attempt to murder** (Section 307 IPC/Section 109 BNS)
- Not merely attempt to cause hurt

**Principle**: Seriousness of attempt is determined by **intention**, not by result.

---

### 4️⃣ **R v. Eagleton** (1855) - English Case (Persuasive)

#### **Principle Established**:

**"Last Act" Test - REJECTED**:
- Earlier test: Only last act before completion is attempt
- This test was found to be too narrow and impractical

**"Proximate Act" Test - ACCEPTED**:
- Act must be **proximate** (immediately connected) to intended crime
- Not remote from completion
- This is the test followed in Indian law

---

### 5️⃣ **Illustrations from Section 62**

#### **Illustration (a) - Attempt to Steal**:
- A makes attempt to steal jewels by breaking open a box
- Finds after opening box that there is **no jewel** in it
- He has done an act toward commission of theft
- Therefore guilty under Section 62

**Principle**: **Impossibility is no defense** - Even though jewels not present, attempt punishable.

#### **Illustration (b) - Attempt to Pick Pocket**:
- A attempts to pick pocket of Z
- Thrusts his hand into Z's pocket
- A fails because Z has **nothing in pocket**
- A is guilty under Section 62

**Principle**: Attempt punishable even if completion impossible due to circumstances.

---

## 🔍 Legal Impossibility vs Factual Impossibility

### **Factual Impossibility**

**Definition**: Crime cannot be completed because of **factual circumstances** unknown to accused.

**Examples**:
1. Attempting to steal from empty pocket (no money present)
2. Attempting to steal from empty box (no jewels present)
3. Attempting to kill person who is already dead (victim already deceased)
4. Administering insufficient quantity of poison (not enough to kill)

**Legal Effect**: **NOT a defense** - Attempt is still punishable under Section 62.

**Reason**: Accused had criminal intent and did act toward commission. Failure due to external circumstances should not excuse.

---

### **Legal Impossibility**

**Definition**: What accused attempts to do is **not a crime** at all under law.

**Examples**:
1. A believes receiving smuggled goods is crime (but it is not under law)
   - A "attempts" to receive smuggled goods
   - This is legal impossibility - NO crime

2. A believes having extramarital affair is crime (after adultery decriminalized)
   - A "attempts" to commit adultery
   - This is legal impossibility - NO crime

**Legal Effect**: **Defense available** - No attempt because no underlying crime exists.

**Reason**: Cannot punish attempt to do something that is not a crime.

---

## 📚 Summary

**Attempt** is an inchoate crime where:
- Person intends to commit an offense
- Does act toward its commission
- Crime is not completed

**Four Stages of Crime**:
1. Intention (not punishable)
2. Preparation (generally not punishable)
3. Attempt (punishable under Section 62)
4. Accomplishment (fully punishable)

**Critical Distinction - Preparation vs Attempt**:
- **Preparation**: Remote from crime, arranging means
- **Attempt**: Proximate to crime, direct movement toward commission

**Section 62 BNS Requirements**:
1. Offense punishable with imprisonment
2. Does act toward commission
3. No express provision for attempt

**Punishment**: Half of main offense punishment

**Impossibility**: 
- Factual impossibility = No defense
- Legal impossibility = Defense available

**Key Principle**: **"Where preparation ends and attempt begins"** depends on proximity, unequivocality, and circumstances of each case.
