## 📝 Introduction to Offenses Against Property

Chapter XVII of BNS 2023 deals with **Offenses Against Property**. These offenses protect the right to property, which is a fundamental aspect of civilized society. Theft and extortion are two primary property offenses that differ in the **manner of taking** property - theft involves taking **without consent**, while extortion involves taking with **consent obtained through fear or threat**.

---

## 📖 THEFT (Section 303 BNS)

### ⚖️ Definition (Previously Section 378 IPC)

**Section 303 BNS**: "Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of any person without that person's consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit theft."

---

### 🧩 5 Essential Ingredients of Theft

---

### **1️⃣ DISHONEST INTENTION**

#### **Requirement**: Must have **dishonest intention** to take property

**"Dishonestly"** (Section 23 BNS / Section 24 IPC):
- Doing anything with intention of causing **wrongful gain** to one person OR **wrongful loss** to another

**Wrongful Gain** (Section 22 BNS):
- Gaining property **unlawfully**
- Person losing property is legal owner

**Wrongful Loss** (Section 22 BNS):
- Loss brought about by **unlawful means**
- Person losing property loses what he is legally entitled to

**Test for Dishonesty**:
- Did accused intend to cause wrongful gain to himself or wrongful loss to owner?
- Did accused know he had no right to take property?

**Examples of Dishonest Intention**:
- ✅ Taking someone's property knowing it belongs to them
- ✅ Taking property intending to sell and keep money
- ✅ Taking property with no intention to return

**Examples of NO Dishonest Intention**:
- ❌ Taking property by genuine mistake thinking it's own
- ❌ Taking property with owner's permission
- ❌ Taking lost property and making reasonable efforts to find owner

---

#### **Case Law: M/s Shriram Transport Finance v. R. Khaishiullah Khan**

**Facts**: Payment for hire-purchase agreement defaulted, property seized by financer

**Held**: NOT theft - financer entitled to seize property, no dishonest intention

**Principle**: If person has legal right to take property, no dishonest intention, hence no theft.

---

### **2️⃣ MOVABLE PROPERTY**

#### **Requirement**: Property must be **movable**

**"Movable Property"** (Section 21 BNS / Section 22 IPC):
- Any **corporeal property** (tangible)
- **Except** land and things permanently attached to earth

**Key Point**: Only movable property can be stolen - impossible to "take away" immovable property.

---

#### **What Can Be Stolen**

✅ **Movable Property**:
- Money, jewelry, vehicles, electronics
- Furniture, clothes, books
- Animals (cattle, pets)
- Goods, merchandise

❌ **NOT Movable** (Cannot be stolen):
- Land, buildings
- Trees permanently attached to earth (until cut)
- Fixtures permanently attached

---

#### **Special Cases**

**A. Crops and Trees**

**Growing crops/trees**: Attached to earth → **Immovable**
- Cannot be stolen while growing

**After severance**: Removed from earth → **Movable**
- Can be stolen once cut or removed

**Example**:
- A cuts down tree on B's land intending to steal
- While tree is standing → NOT yet theft
- After A removes cut tree → Theft committed

---

**B. Electricity**

**Status**: Ruled to be **immovable property** in **Avtar Singh v. State of Punjab** (1965)

**BUT**: Stealing electricity made punishable offense under **Electricity Act, 2003 (Section 35)**
- Punishment: Up to 3 years + fine

**Reason**: Electricity is essential utility, special legislation needed

---

**C. Data/Information**

**Status**: Data is **intangible** (only information), hence **incorporeal**
- Does NOT come under definition of theft under Section 303 BNS

**Exception**: If data stored on **tangible object** (hard drive, USB)
- Theft of that physical object = Theft
- But theft of data itself = NOT covered under Section 303

**Modern Issue**: Data theft major problem but not covered by traditional theft provision - may be covered by IT Act.

---

**D. Human Body**

**Living human body**: NOT movable property
- Kidnapping, not theft

**Preserved body/skeleton**: Can be considered movable property
- If preserved or skeleton kept, falls under theft definition

---

### **3️⃣ TAKING OUT OF POSSESSION OF ANY PERSON**

#### **Requirement**: Property must be taken **out of possession** of another person

**"Possession"** means:
- Actual physical **custody**, OR
- **Legal control** over property
- Not necessarily ownership

**Key Point**: Must take from someone's possession

**Who Can Be Victim**:
- Owner of property, OR
- Any person having lawful possession/custody
- Even finder of lost property (has possessory rights)

---

#### **Property Must Be in Someone's Possession**

**Examples**:

✅ **Theft** (property in possession):
- Taking money from person's wallet
- Taking parked car
- Taking goods from shop
- Taking property from house

❌ **NOT Theft** (no possession):
- Taking **abandoned property** (no one in possession)
- Finding lost property and making efforts to locate owner
- Taking property from deceased with legal right

---

#### **Possession by Finder**

**Illustration from Section**:
- A finds rupees in public place, not in anyone's possession
- A takes the rupees
- If A takes for himself, knowing owner cannot be found → NOT theft
- If A takes knowing owner can be found but makes no effort → Theft

---

### **4️⃣ WITHOUT THAT PERSON'S CONSENT**

#### **Requirement**: Taking must be **without consent** of person in possession

**Critical Element**: **Absence of consent**

**Consent Can Be**:
- **Express**: Explicitly given verbally or in writing
- **Implied**: Inferred from circumstances

**Key Distinctions**:

**No Consent** → **THEFT**

**Consent obtained by deception** → **CHEATING** (not theft)

**Consent obtained by fear/threat** → **EXTORTION** (not theft)

**Valid consent** → **NOT Theft**

---

#### **When Consent is Invalid**

**Consent NOT valid if**:
- Given by person of **unsound mind**
- Given during **intoxication**
- Obtained by **coercion**
- Obtained by **misrepresentation** (becomes cheating)
- Obtained by **fear of injury** (becomes extortion)

---

### **5️⃣ MOVING THE PROPERTY**

#### **Requirement**: Accused must **move** the property in order to take it

**"Moving"**: Any motion, however slight, causing change of position

**Key Point**: Theft is **complete** the moment property moved, even if:
- Property not removed from premises
- Accused caught immediately
- Property not taken far

**Test**: Has there been any movement with dishonest intention?

---

#### **Examples**

✅ **Movement Constitutes Theft**:
- Lifting article from shelf (even before leaving shop)
- Pushing car few inches
- Picking up wallet from table
- Moving goods within same room

❌ **No Movement - NOT Theft**:
- Merely touching property without moving
- Looking at property
- Planning to take but not moved

---

#### **Case Law: Pyarelal Bhargava v. State**

**Facts**: Government employee took file from office, presented it to B, brought back after 2 days

**Issue**: Whether temporary taking constitutes theft?

**Held**: **YES** - Theft committed

**Reasoning**:
- **Permanent taking NOT required**
- Even **temporary movement** with dishonest intention is enough
- Moving property constitutes theft

**Principle**: **Animus** (intention) at time of taking determines theft, not whether permanently kept.

---

### **ILLUSTRATION**: When is Theft Complete?

**Scenario**: A cuts tree on B's land intending to steal timber

**Analysis**:
- A cuts tree → Tree falls → Still on B's land
- **NOT yet theft** (not moved out of possession)
- A removes cut tree from B's land → Property moved
- **Theft complete** at moment of moving

**Principle**: Theft complete when property moved with dishonest intention, not when damage done.

---

## 📖 EXTORTION (Section 308 BNS)

### ⚖️ Definition (Previously Section 383 IPC)

**Section 308 BNS**: "Whoever intentionally puts any person in fear of any injury to that person, or to any other, and thereby dishonestly induces the person so put in fear to deliver to any person any property or valuable security or anything signed or sealed which may be converted into a valuable security, commits extortion."

---

### 🧩 5 Essential Ingredients of Extortion

---

### **1️⃣ INTENTIONALLY PUTTING PERSON IN FEAR**

**Requirement**: Accused must **intentionally** create fear in victim's mind

**Key Elements**:
- Must be **intentional** act (not accidental)
- Must create **fear** (apprehension of harm)
- Fear must be of **injury** (as defined)

**"Intentionally"**: Deliberately and purposefully creating fear

**Test**: Did accused aim to create fear in victim?

---

### **2️⃣ FEAR OF INJURY**

**Requirement**: Fear must be of **injury** to:
- That person (victim himself), OR
- Any other person (family, friend, anyone)

**"Injury"** (Section 44 BNS):
- Harm **illegally caused** to:
  - Person
  - Body
  - Mind
  - Reputation
  - Property

**Types of Injury Feared**:
- Physical harm (death, hurt, assault)
- Harm to reputation (defamation, exposure of secrets)
- Harm to property (damage, destruction)
- Mental torture or harassment

**Scope**: Fear can be of:
- Immediate harm, OR
- **Future harm** (unlike robbery which requires instant fear)

**Examples**:
- "Give money or I'll kill you tomorrow" → Extortion
- "Give property or I'll expose your secrets" → Extortion
- "Give money or I'll harm your family" → Extortion

---

### **3️⃣ DISHONESTLY INDUCING**

**Requirement**: By putting in fear, accused **dishonestly induces** victim

**Two Elements**:

**Dishonestly**: Intention to cause wrongful gain or wrongful loss

**Induces**: Causes victim to act (deliver property)
- Victim acts because of fear created
- Causal link between fear and delivery

**Test**: Did fear cause victim to deliver property?

---

### **4️⃣ DELIVERY OF PROPERTY OR VALUABLE SECURITY**

**Requirement**: Victim **delivers**:
- Property (movable or immovable), OR
- Valuable security, OR
- Signed/sealed document convertible to valuable security

**"Delivery"**: Voluntary transfer by victim (under threat)

**Scope - Broader Than Theft**:
- **Movable** property (like theft)
- **Immovable** property (unlike theft - major difference)
- **Valuable securities** (shares, bonds, promissory notes)
- **Documents** that can be converted to valuable security

**Examples of What Can Be Extorted**:
- Cash, jewelry (movable)
- Land, house (immovable)
- Share certificates, bonds
- Signed blank checks

---

### **5️⃣ DELIVERY TO ANY PERSON**

**Requirement**: Property delivered to:
- Accused himself, OR
- **Any person** at accused's behest

**Key Point**: Need not be to accused directly

**Example**:
- A threatens B to give money to C
- B gives money to C due to fear
- This is extortion by A (though property went to C)

---

### **ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SECTION 308**

**Illustration 1**:
- A threatens to publish defamatory matter about Z unless Z gives money
- Z gives money
- This is **extortion** (fear of injury to reputation)

**Illustration 2**:
- A threatens to send armed men to kill Z unless Z signs document transferring land
- Z signs document
- This is **extortion** (fear of death, immovable property)
