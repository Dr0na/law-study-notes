## 📝 Understanding Robbery and Dacoity

Robbery and Dacoity are **aggravated forms** of property offenses where the crime against property is accompanied by **crime against person** (violence or threat). These offenses are considered more serious than simple theft or extortion because they involve dual harm:
1. Loss of property
2. Violence or fear of violence to persons

The presence of force or threat makes these offenses particularly dangerous to public safety and attracts much higher punishment than simple theft.

## 📖 ROBBERY (Section 309 BNS)

### ⚖️ Definition (Previously Section 390 IPC)

**"Robbery** is either **theft** or **extortion** when, in order to commit the theft or extortion, or in committing the theft or extortion, or in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by the theft or extortion, the offender, for that end, voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint, or fear of instant death or of instant hurt or of instant wrongful restraint."

### 🧩 5 Essential Ingredients of Robbery

---

### **1️⃣ THEFT OR EXTORTION MUST BE PRESENT**

**Base Requirement**: Robbery builds upon **theft** (Section 303) OR **extortion** (Section 308)

**Key Point**: Without underlying theft or extortion, there cannot be robbery

**Two Scenarios**:

**(a) Robbery based on THEFT**:
- Taking movable property without consent + Force
- Example: Snatching purse forcefully

**(b) Robbery based on EXTORTION**:
- Taking property by putting in fear + Additional force/instant threat
- Example: Threatening at gunpoint and taking property

**Formula**: 
```
ROBBERY = THEFT + FORCE/THREAT OF INSTANT HARM
OR
ROBBERY = EXTORTION + FORCE/THREAT OF INSTANT HARM
```

---

### **2️⃣ VOLUNTARY CAUSING OR ATTEMPT TO CAUSE HARM**

**Requirement**: Offender voluntarily causes or **attempts to cause**:
- **Death**, OR
- **Hurt**, OR
- **Wrongful restraint**

**"Voluntarily"** (Section 39 BNS):
- Causing effect intentionally
- Not by accident or without knowledge
- Deliberate use of force

**"Attempts to Cause"**: Even attempt to harm sufficient, actual harm not required

**Examples**:
- Hitting victim with weapon (causing hurt)
- Pushing victim to ground (causing hurt)
- Holding victim to prevent movement (wrongful restraint)
- Attempting to strike but missing (attempt to cause hurt)

---

### **3️⃣ PUTTING IN FEAR OF INSTANT HARM**

**Requirement**: Putting person in **fear of instant**:
- Death, OR
- Hurt, OR
- Wrongful restraint

**"Instant"**: Immediate, right now, not future

**Critical Distinction from Extortion**:
- **Extortion**: Fear of future harm acceptable
- **Robbery**: Fear must be of **instant** (immediate) harm

**Examples**:

✅ **Instant Fear** (Robbery):
- "Give wallet now or I'll stab you" (instant threat)
- Pointing gun at person saying "money now" (instant)
- "Hand over jewelry or I'll hit you right now" (instant)

❌ **NOT Instant** (Extortion only, not Robbery):
- "Give money tomorrow or I'll harm you" (future)
- "Pay by next week or face consequences" (future)

---

### **4️⃣ FORCE/THREAT MUST BE ON PERSON**

**Requirement**: Force or threat must be against **person**, not merely against property

**"Person" Can Be**:
- Person whose property is taken (owner), OR
- Any person **present** at time of theft/extortion

**Examples**:

✅ **Force on Person** (Robbery):
- Hitting owner before taking property
- Threatening cashier at gunpoint
- Restraining guard while taking goods
- Pushing bystander who tries to intervene

❌ **Force Only on Property** (NOT Robbery):
- Breaking lock of empty house (no person present)
- Cutting chain link fence (no person threatened)
- Breaking car window when no one inside

**Principle**: Robbery requires **personal violence** or threat thereof, not just property damage.

---

### **5️⃣ FORCE/THREAT FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSE**

**Requirement**: Force/threat used "for that end" - meaning:
- In order to commit theft/extortion, OR
- In committing theft/extortion, OR
- In carrying away property obtained, OR
- In attempting to carry away property

**Three Stages When Force Can Be Used**:

**Stage 1: BEFORE Taking** (In order to commit):
- Force used to facilitate theft/extortion
- Example: Hitting person, then taking wallet

**Stage 2: DURING Taking** (In committing):
- Force used while taking property
- Example: Snatching chain forcefully from neck

**Stage 3: AFTER Taking** (Carrying away):
- Force used to escape with property or retain it
- Example: Taking purse, then pushing victim who tries to stop

**All three constitute robbery** if other elements satisfied.
