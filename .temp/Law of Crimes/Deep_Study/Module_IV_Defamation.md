## 📝 Introduction

Defamation is an offense that protects **reputation**, which is recognized as a valuable asset and quasi-property right. The law recognizes that reputation is earned through years of honest living and can be destroyed by malicious falsehoods. Defamation balances **protection of reputation** with **freedom of speech and expression** (Article 19(1)(a) of Constitution), providing specific exceptions where public interest or legitimate discourse prevails over individual reputation. Section 356 BNS carefully defines what constitutes defamation and provides **ten exceptions** where otherwise defamatory statements are not punishable.

## 🧩 4 Essential Ingredients

### **1️⃣ IMPUTATION**

**Requirement**: There must be an **imputation** (statement, assertion, allegation) concerning a person

**"Imputation"**: Any statement or suggestion attributing something to person

**Forms**:

**Modern Forms**:

**Requirement**: Imputation must harm or be likely to harm **reputation**
