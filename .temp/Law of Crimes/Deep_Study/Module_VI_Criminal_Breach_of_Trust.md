## 📝 Introduction

Criminal Breach of Trust (CBT) is an important offense against property under BNS 2023, covered under **Sections 316-319** (previously Sections 405-409 IPC). It involves a **breach of trust relationship** where a person who is entrusted with property or dominion over property dishonestly misappropriates or converts it. Unlike theft, where property is taken without consent, CBT involves **betrayal of confidence** reposed in the accused. The offense strikes at the foundation of trust relationships in society and commercial transactions.

## 🧩 4 Essential Ingredients of Criminal Breach of Trust

---

### **1️⃣ ENTRUSTMENT OF PROPERTY OR DOMINION OVER PROPERTY**

#### **A. Entrustment - The Foundation**

**Requirement**: There must be **entrustment** of property or dominion over property to the accused

**"Entrustment"**: 
- Property delivered or handed over to accused
- Accused given custody, control, or authority over property
- Relationship of trust created

**Two Forms of Entrustment**:

**(i) Entrustment with Property**:
- Actual physical **custody** given to accused
- Accused has property in his possession

**Example**: 
- Customer deposits money with banker
- Principal hands goods to agent
- Employer gives cash to employee

**(ii) Entrustment with Dominion Over Property**:
- **Control or authority** over property given
- May not have actual physical custody
- Power to manage or deal with property

**Example**:
- Power of attorney to manage property
- Trustee managing trust property
- Executor administering estate

---

#### **B. Characteristics of Entrustment**

**1. Lawful Entrustment**:
- Property must be entrusted **lawfully**
- Not stolen or taken without permission
- Voluntary transfer of custody/control

**2. Fiduciary/Trust Relationship**:
- Relationship of trust between parties
- Could be as agent, trustee, executor, employee, banker, etc.
- Confidence reposed in accused

**3. Ownership NOT Transferred**:
- Accused gets only **custody/control**, NOT ownership
- Property still belongs to entruster
- Accused holds property for benefit of owner

**4. In Any Manner**:
- Entrustment can be by any means
- Express agreement OR implied
- Written contract OR oral understanding

---

#### **Importance of Entrustment**

**Case Law: Ramaswamy Nadar v. State of Madras** (AIR 1957 SC)

**Held**: "Entrustment is **very important** in cases of criminal breach of trust. Unless there exists entrustment, there can be **no offense** under Section 405 IPC (now Section 316 BNS)."

**Principle**: Entrustment is **sine qua non** (essential condition) for CBT.

---

### **2️⃣ DISHONEST MISAPPROPRIATION OR CONVERSION**

#### **A. Three Prohibited Acts**

**Act (a): Dishonest Misappropriation**

**"Misappropriation"**: 
- Setting apart property for oneself
- Treating entrusted property as one's own
- Using property for own purposes

**Examples**:
- Agent using sale proceeds for personal expenses
- Employee using employer's petty cash for own needs
- Trustee using trust funds for personal investment

---

**Act (b): Dishonest Conversion to Own Use**

**"Conversion"**:
- Changing nature or character of property
- Dealing with property as if owner
- Disposing of property

**Examples**:
- Trustee selling trust property and using proceeds
- Banker transferring customer's money to own account
- Agent selling principal's goods and keeping money

---

**Act (c): Dishonest Use/Disposal in Violation of Direction or Contract**

**"In violation of"**:

- Legal contract (express or implied) regarding discharge of trust

**Examples**:
- Executor using estate property contrary to will

---

#### **B. "Dishonestly" - Essential Element**

**Section 23 BNS**: "Dishonestly" means intention to cause:
- **Wrongful gain** to oneself or another, OR
- **Wrongful loss** to another

**Key Elements**:
- Accused knows he has no legal right to use property
- Intends to gain or cause loss wrongfully
- Acts contrary to trust reposed

**Test**: Did accused act with knowledge that he was violating trust and causing wrongful gain/loss?

---

### **3️⃣ PROPERTY SUBJECT TO ENTRUSTMENT**

**Requirement**: Property misappropriated must be:
- The **same property** entrusted, OR
- **Proceeds** of that property, OR
- **Substitutes** for that property

**Key Point**: Cannot breach trust over property never entrusted

**Examples**:

✅ **Property Entrusted**:
- Agent entrusted with goods worth Rs. 1 lakh

---

### **4️⃣ VIOLATION OF TRUST**

**Direction of Law**:
- Statutory provisions governing trust relationship
- Example: Trust Act provisions, Company law provisions

**Legal Contract**:

- **Implied contract**: Understanding about property use, duties implied by relationship

**Examples**:

**Violation of Law**:

- Trustee investing in prohibited securities

**Violation of Contract**:
