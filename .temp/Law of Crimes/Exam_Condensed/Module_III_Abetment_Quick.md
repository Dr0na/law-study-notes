## 📘 One-Line Definition

**Abetment** = To **aid, encourage, incite, instigate** or **assist** another in commission of crime.

---

## 🔑 3 FORMS (I-C-A)

### 1️⃣ INSTIGATION
**What**: Goad, urge, provoke, incite, encourage

**Requirements**:
- Active incitement
- Intention to instigate
- Must precede act

**Example**: A tells B "C wronged you, teach him lesson" → B attacks → Abetment

**Memory**: **G-U-P-I** (Goad, Urge, Provoke, Incite)

---

### 2️⃣ CONSPIRACY
**What**: Agreement between 2+ persons to abet

**4 Elements (A-T-I-O)**:
1. **A**greement (express/implied)
2. **T**wo or more persons
3. **I**ntention (common)
4. **O**vert act (sometimes required)

**Example**: A, B, C agree to rob → All abettors even before robbery

**⚠️ Distinguish**: Conspiracy to Abet ≠ Criminal Conspiracy (S.61)

**Memory**: **A-T-I-O**

---

### 3️⃣ INTENTIONAL AID
**What**: Intentionally helping by act or illegal omission

**5 Requirements (P-I-F-T-K)**:
1. **P**ositive act or illegal omission
2. **I**ntentional (not accidental)
3. **F**acilitate commission
4. **T**iming (at or before offence)
5. **K**nowledge of nature of offence

**Forms of Aid**: Weapons, Info, Watch-keeping, Transport, Tools

**Example**: A supplies poison to B (knowing B will kill C) → Abetment

**Memory**: **P-I-F-T-K**

---

## ⚖️ 6 LIABILITY SITUATIONS (G-N-P-D-I-M)

### 1️⃣ **G**eneral Rule
- Liable **as if committed act himself**
- **Same punishment** as principal

### 2️⃣ **N**ot Done
- **Still liable** for abetment
- Even if act not committed or different act done

### 3️⃣ **P**robable Consequence
- Liable if act was **foreseeable**
- Must have known or should have known

**Example**: A instigates robbery → B murders during robbery → A liable if murder foreseeable

### 4️⃣ **D**ifferent Intention
- Liable based on **OWN intention**
- Not perpetrator's intention

**Example**: A instigates hurt → B murders → A liable for hurt only (unless knew murder possible)

### 5️⃣ **I**nnocent Agent
- Liable **AS PRINCIPAL** (not just abettor)
- When uses person without mens rea (child, insane, mistake)

**Example**: A gives poison to 6-year-old B → B puts in C's food → C dies → A liable as principal

### 6️⃣ **M**ultiple Offences
- All liable if within **common intention**
- And **probable consequence**

**Example**: A, B, C conspire for dacoity → C murders → All liable if murder foreseeable

**Memory**: **G-N-P-D-I-M**

## 📝 Must-Remember Points

### Counts:
- **3** Forms
- **4** Conspiracy elements
- **5** Aid requirements
- **6** Liability situations
- Sections **45-60**

### Key Distinctions:

✔ Mere presence ≠ Aid (must be intentional help)
✔ Abetment ≠ Attempt (helping others vs trying oneself)

### Critical Illustrations (Memorize):
1. Instigation: A incites B → B refuses → A still liable
2. Conspiracy: A, B, C agree to rob → All abettors
3. Aid: A supplies weapon knowing purpose → Abetment
4. Probable: Robbery abetment → Murder happens → Liable if foreseeable
5. Innocent Agent: Using child → Principal liability
