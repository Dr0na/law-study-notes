## 🔴 Stage 1: INTENTION

**Nature**: Purely mental stage

**Characteristics**:
- Formation of criminal intent
- No external manifestation
- Desire to commit crime

**Punishability**: ❌ **NOT PUNISHABLE**

**Maxim**: "Cogitationis poenam nemo patitur" (No one punished for thoughts)

**Example**: A thinks of stealing B's car → NOT punishable

---

## 🟠 Stage 2: PREPARATION

**Nature**: Taking steps to commit crime

**Characteristics**:
- Arranging means, devising measures
- Collecting tools, weapons
- Planning the crime
- Still remote from actual commission

**Punishability**: ❌ **GENERALLY NOT PUNISHABLE**

**Exceptions** (Preparation IS punishable):
- Preparation to wage war
- Preparation to commit dacoity
- Counterfeiting coins/stamps

**Example**: A buys gun to kill B → NOT punishable (unless exception)

---

## 🟡 Stage 3: ATTEMPT

**Nature**: Direct movement toward commission

**Characteristics**:
- Goes beyond preparation
- Overt act done
- Direct step to commit crime
- Crime not completed due to some reason

**Punishability**: ✅ **PUNISHABLE (Section 62 BNS)**

**Example**: A points gun at B, gun misfires → PUNISHABLE

---

## 🟢 Stage 4: ACCOMPLISHMENT

**Nature**: Successful completion

**Characteristics**:
- All elements satisfied
- Intended result achieved
- Crime complete

**Punishability**: ✅ **FULLY PUNISHABLE**

**Example**: A shoots B, B dies → Murder complete

---

## ⚖️ CRITICAL: Preparation vs Attempt

### **The Most Important Question**

**"Where does preparation end and attempt begin?"**

---

### **Tests to Distinguish**

| **Preparation** | **Attempt** |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Arranging means | Direct movement toward crime |
| Remote from crime | Proximate to crime |
| Ambiguous intent | Unequivocal intent |
| Before commencing | During commission |
| Can easily withdraw | Difficult to withdraw |

---

### **Practical Examples**

| Scenario | Stage |
|----------|-------|
| Buying gun to kill | PREPARATION |
| Loading gun, keeping ready | PREPARATION |
| Going to victim's house with gun | BORDERLINE |
| Pointing loaded gun at victim | **ATTEMPT** |
| Pulling trigger, gun misfires | **ATTEMPT** |
| Shooting and killing | ACCOMPLISHMENT |

---

## 📖 Section 62 BNS: Punishment for Attempt

### **Provision Summary**

"Whoever **attempts** to commit offense punishable with **imprisonment**, and in such attempt **does any act toward commission**, shall be punished with **half the punishment** for main offense."

---

### **3 Essential Ingredients**

**1️⃣ Offense Punishable with Imprisonment**
- Must be punishable with life or term imprisonment
- ❌ NOT applicable: Death only, Fine only

**2️⃣ Does Act Toward Commission**
- Must do **overt act**
- Not mere preparation
- Need not be **penultimate act**
- Must be act **during course** of committing

**3️⃣ No Express Provision**
- Section 62 is **residuary provision**
- Applies only when no specific attempt provision exists

---

### **Express Provisions (Section 62 NOT applicable)**

| Offense | BNS Section | Punishment |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Attempt to Murder | 109 | Up to 10 years |
| Attempt to Wage War | 148 | Life or 10 years |
| Attempt to Robbery | 312 | Up to 7 years |

---

## 🔑 Punishment Formula

**Attempt = ½ × Main Offense**

| Main Offense | Attempt |
|--------------|---------|
| 10 years | 5 years |
| 7 years | 3.5 years |
| Life | ½ of life |

---

## ❌ Impossibility - Not a Defense

### **Factual Impossibility**

**Definition**: Crime cannot be completed due to facts unknown to accused

**Examples**:
- Stealing from empty pocket ✅ Punishable
- Stealing from empty box ✅ Punishable
- Killing already dead person ✅ Punishable

**Legal Effect**: ❌ **NOT a defense** - Attempt still punishable

---

### **Legal Impossibility**

**Definition**: What accused attempts is not a crime

**Example**: Believes legal act is illegal and "attempts" it

**Legal Effect**: ✅ **Defense available** - No underlying crime

---

## 🏛️ Key Case Law

### **Abhayanand Mishra v. Bihar** (Leading Case)

**Facts**: Applied to exam with forged documents, caught before exam

**Held**: Guilty of attempt to cheat

**Principles**:
1. **Preparation ends when act toward commission begins**
2. **Penultimate act NOT required**
3. **Impossibility NO defense**

**Application**:
- Preparing application = Preparation
- **Dispatching application = Attempt** ✅

---

## 🧠 Memory Aids

### **"IPAA" for Stages**
- **I** - Intention (not punishable)
- **P** - Preparation (generally not punishable)
- **A** - Attempt (punishable - Sec 62)
- **A** - Accomplishment (fully punishable)

### **"OOE" for Section 62**
- **O** - Offense punishable with imprisonment
- **O** - Overt act done
- **E** - Express provision absent

### **Remember Illustrations**
- **Empty Box** - Attempt to steal from empty box = Punishable
- **Empty Pocket** - Attempt to pick empty pocket = Punishable

---

## ⚡ Quick Points

✅ **4 Stages**: Intention → Preparation → Attempt → Accomplishment

✅ Only **Attempt & Accomplishment** punishable (general rule)

✅ **Section 62** applies when no express provision

✅ **Punishment**: Half of main offense

✅ **Preparation vs Attempt**: Key distinction (proximity test)

✅ **Factual impossibility** = NO defense

✅ **Legal impossibility** = Defense available

✅ **Abhayanand Mishra**: Dispatching = Attempt

✅ **Overt act** required, but need not be last act

✅ **Section 62 illustrations**: Empty box, empty pocket
