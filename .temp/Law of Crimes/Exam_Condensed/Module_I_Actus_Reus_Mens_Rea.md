# 📕 Quick Revision: Elements of Crime (Actus Reus & Mens Rea)

## 🎯 5-Minute Revision Sheet

---

## 📌 Fundamental Maxim

**"Actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea"**

**Meaning**: An act does not make a person guilty unless the mind is also guilty

---

## 🧩 2 Essential Elements of Crime

```
CRIME = ACTUS REUS + MENS REA
        (Physical)    (Mental)
```

---

## 🔴 ACTUS REUS (Physical Element)

### **Definition**
- **Actus** = Deed/Act
- **Reus** = Guilty/Wrongful
- Physical/External element of crime

### **Types**
1. **Act** (Commission) - Positive action causing harm
2. **Omission** (Failure to act) - Failing legal duty
3. **State of Affairs** - Situation itself criminal

### **Requirements**
- ✅ Voluntary conduct
- ✅ Causation (act causes result)
- ✅ Specific consequences (for result crimes)

### **Examples**
- Murder: Death of person (result) caused by stabbing (act)
- Theft: Taking and removing property
- Assault: Application of force

---

## 🔵 MENS REA (Mental Element)

### **Definition**
- **Mens** = Mind
- **Rea** = Guilty
- Mental/Internal element of crime

### **4 Degrees of Mens Rea**

| Degree | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **1. Intention** | Purpose/Aim to cause result | Murder with intent to kill |
| **2. Knowledge** | Awareness of consequences | Selling adulterated food |
| **3. Recklessness** | Conscious risk-taking | Rash driving |
| **4. Negligence** | Failure of reasonable care | Death by negligence |

### **Types**
- **Specific Intent** - Particular intent required (murder)
- **General Intent** - Intent to do act itself (assault)
- **Transferred Malice** - Intent toward A, harm to B
- **Constructive Malice** - Intent to do one act, causes another

## ⚖️ Actus Reus vs Mens Rea

| Aspect | Actus Reus | Mens Rea |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **Nature** | Physical/External | Mental/Internal |
| **Proof** | Observable, tangible | Inferred from conduct |
| **Example** | Stabbing | Intention to kill |
| **Without it** | No crime | No crime (except strict liability) |

---

## 🔑 Key Principles

### **1. Both Required (General Rule)**
```
Actus Reus ALONE → No Crime (except strict liability)
Mens Rea ALONE → No Crime (thoughts not punishable)
Actus Reus + Mens Rea → CRIME
```

### **2. Coincidence in Time**
- Both must exist at **same time**
- Continuing act doctrine - if actus reus continues, mens rea formed during it counts

### **3. Causation**
- **Factual Causation**: "But for" test
- **Legal Causation**: Act must be proximate cause

---

## 📊 Motive vs Intention

| **Motive** | **Intention** |
|------------|--------------|
| **Why** act done (reason) | **What** accused wanted (purpose) |
| Ulterior purpose | Immediate objective |
| NOT essential for crime | Essential for most crimes |
| Relevant for sentencing | Determines guilt |
| Example: Kill for money (motive) | Kill person (intention) |

---

## ❌ Exceptions: Strict Liability

### **When Mens Rea NOT Required**

**Strict Liability Offenses**:
- Regulatory/Public welfare offenses
- Traffic violations
- Sale of adulterated food
- Environmental violations

**Why**: 
- Public safety paramount
- Difficulty in proving mens rea
- Deter carelessness

---

## 🧠 Memory Aids

### **"ACTUS" for Physical Element**
- **A** - Act or omission
- **C** - Causation required
- **T** - Tangible/observable
- **U** - Unlawful conduct
- **S** - Specific result (for result crimes)

### **"IKRN" for Mens Rea Degrees**
- **I** - Intention
- **K** - Knowledge
- **R** - Recklessness
- **N** - Negligence

---

## ⚡ Quick Points

✅ Maxim: Actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea

✅ **Actus Reus** = Physical element (act, omission, or state)

✅ **Mens Rea** = Mental element (intent, knowledge, recklessness, negligence)

✅ **Both required** for crime (except strict liability)

✅ **Motive** ≠ Intention (motive not essential, intention is)

✅ **Causation** important for actus reus

✅ **4 degrees** of mens rea (IKRN)

✅ **Transferred Malice**: A intends to harm B, actually harms C (still liable)

✅ **Strict Liability**: No mens rea needed (regulatory offenses)

✅ Mere **thoughts** not punishable (cogitationis poenam nemo patitur)
