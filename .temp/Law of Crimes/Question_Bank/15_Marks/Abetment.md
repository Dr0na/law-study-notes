## ✅ MODEL ANSWER (SPPU STYLE)

### Introduction (2 marks)

**Abetment** is an **inchoate crime** that means to aid, encourage, incite, instigate, or assist another person in the commission of a crime. It is defined under **Sections 45-60 of the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023**.

The concept of abetment is based on the principle that **a person who facilitates the commission of a crime should be held equally liable** as if he had committed the crime himself. Abetment is punishable even when the main offence is not actually committed, as the law seeks to prevent crime at the facilitation stage itself.

---

### THREE Forms of Abetment (6 marks)

The BNS recognizes **THREE distinct forms** by which a person may abet an offence:

### 1️⃣ Abetment by Instigation (2 marks)

**Definition**: Instigation means to **goad, urge, provoke, incite, encourage, or stimulate** a person to do an act or omission.

**Characteristics**:
- Active suggestion or stimulation
- Creating in the mind of the person instigated the idea to commit the offence
- Can be done through direct suggestion, hints, insinuation, or encouragement

**Essential Requirements**:
- There must be active incitement
- Intention to instigate must be present
- Instigation must precede the act

**Illustration**:
A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. Here, A has committed the offence of abetment by instigation, even though B refused and the murder was not committed. The liability of A arises from the act of instigation itself.

**Example**:
If A falsely tells B that C has been speaking ill of B's family, knowing this will provoke B to assault C, this constitutes abetment by instigation.

---

### 2️⃣ Abetment by Conspiracy (2 marks)

**Definition**: Conspiracy to abet means when **two or more persons engage themselves by agreement** to abet the doing of a thing.

**Characteristics**:
- Agreement between two or more persons
- Agreement to commit or cause commission of an offence
- Common intention to achieve unlawful object

**Essential Requirements**:
- **Agreement** (express or implied) between parties
- **Two or more persons** must be involved
- **Intention** to commit the offence must be common
- In some cases, **overt act** in furtherance of agreement required

**Illustration**:
A, B, and C agree to commit robbery. They plan the act together. All three are guilty of abetment by conspiracy even before the actual robbery is committed. The agreement itself, coupled with the common intention, constitutes abetment.

**Distinction from Criminal Conspiracy**:
- Abetment by conspiracy: Conspiracy to abet commission of offence
- Criminal conspiracy (Section 61): Agreement itself is an offence

---

### 3️⃣ Abetment by Intentional Aid (2 marks)

**Definition**: Intentional aid means **intentionally aiding a person** in the commission of an offence **by any act or illegal omission**.

**Characteristics**:
- Actual assistance in commission of offence
- Active help or facilitation
- Must be intentional, not accidental
- Can be by positive act or by illegal omission

**Essential Requirements**:
- **Positive act or illegal omission** must be present
- Aid must be given **intentionally** and knowingly
- Must **facilitate commission** of offence
- Must be given **at or before time of offence**
- Person giving aid must have **knowledge** of nature of offence

**Forms of Aid**:
- Providing weapons
- Providing information
- Removing obstacles
- Keeping watch
- Providing transportation
- Supplying tools/instruments

**Illustration**:
A supplies poison to B knowing that B will use it to kill C. A has abetted murder by intentional aid, even if A did not instigate or conspire with B. The act of supplying poison, with knowledge of its intended use, constitutes abetment.

**Counter-Example**:
A lends his car to B, not knowing that B will use it for robbery. A is NOT an abettor because the essential element of knowledge is missing. There was no intentional aid.

---

### Liability of Abettor (6 marks)

The liability of an abettor is governed by comprehensive provisions that cover various scenarios:

### 1️⃣ General Liability Principle (1 mark)

**Primary Rule**: An abettor is **liable for the act abetted** as if he had committed the act himself.

**Punishment**: Generally, the abettor receives the **same punishment as the principal offender**.

**Example**: If A instigates B to murder C, and B murders C, then A is liable for murder as an abettor, and may receive the same punishment as B, the actual murderer.

---

### 2️⃣ Liability When Act NOT Committed (1 mark)

**Rule**: If the person abetted does **NOT do the act**, or does a **DIFFERENT act**, the abettor is **still liable for abetment**.

**Rationale**: Abetment itself is punishable, whether or not the abetted act is actually committed.

**Illustration**:
A instigates B to murder C. B refuses or fails to do so. A is still guilty of **abetment to murder**, though the murder was not actually committed. The act of instigation itself constitutes the offence of abetment.

**Legal Position**: This ensures that persons cannot escape liability merely because their plans failed or the actual perpetrator changed his mind.

---

### 3️⃣ Liability for Act NOT Intended by Abettor (1.5 marks)

**Rule**: An abettor is liable for an act actually done if:
- The act was a **probable consequence** of the abetment, AND
- The abettor knew or had reason to believe such act might be done

**Rationale**: When a person sets a chain of events in motion, he is responsible for the reasonably foreseeable consequences.

**Illustration 1**:
A instigates B to commit robbery. During the robbery, B commits murder. If A knew that robbery could lead to violence and murder, A is liable not only for abetment of robbery but also for **abetment of murder**, as murder was a probable consequence of the robbery.

**Illustration 2**:
A instigates a mob to attack C. A knows that violence may ensue. During the attack, C is killed. A is liable for culpable homicide as it was a probable consequence of his instigation.

**Key Principle**: The abettor's liability extends to **probable consequences** that he foresaw or should have foreseen.

---

### 4️⃣ Liability When Act Done with Different Intention (1 mark)

**Rule**: If the person abetted does the act with a **DIFFERENT intention** than the abettor, the abettor is liable based on **HIS OWN intention and knowledge**, not on the perpetrator's intention.

**Illustration**:
A instigates B to cause **hurt** to C. B, however, intends to **kill** C and murders him. In this case:
- A is liable only for **abetment to hurt** (not murder), unless A knew B might commit murder
- B is liable for **murder**

**Principle**: Each person's liability is determined by their own mens rea (state of mind), not by the actual outcome alone.

---

### 5️⃣ Liability When Innocent Agent Used (1 mark)

**Rule**: When an abettor uses an **innocent agent** (person without mens rea), the abettor is liable **as a principal**, not merely as an abettor.

**Innocent Agent**: A person who lacks the mental capacity to form criminal intent (e.g., child, insane person, person acting under mistake).

**Illustration**:
A gives poison to a child B (age 6 years) and asks B to put it in C's food. B does so innocently, without understanding. C dies. In this case:
- A is liable for **murder as a principal offender** (not just as abettor)
- B is **not liable** due to lack of mens rea (being below age of criminal responsibility)

**Rationale**: The law treats the abettor as if he had done the act himself through an innocent instrumentality.

---

### 6️⃣ Liability in Conspiracy for Multiple Offences (0.5 marks)

**Rule**: When persons conspire to commit one offence, and during execution commit another offence:
- All are liable for the act done if:
  - It was a **probable consequence** of the conspiracy, AND
  - It was within the **common intention**

**Example**:
A, B, and C conspire to commit dacoity. During the dacoity, C murders someone. All three (A, B, C) are liable for murder if:
- Murder was a probable consequence of dacoity
- They knew that violence including murder might be used

---

### Conclusion (1 mark)

Abetment is a comprehensive doctrine that holds persons liable not only for their direct acts but also for their role in **facilitating, encouraging, or aiding** the commission of crimes by others. The law on abetment serves as a **powerful deterrent** against those who would assist in criminal activities while keeping their hands ostensibly clean. By making abettors liable even when the main offence is not committed, the law ensures that criminal facilitation is punished at the earliest possible stage, thereby **protecting society** and **preventing crime**.
