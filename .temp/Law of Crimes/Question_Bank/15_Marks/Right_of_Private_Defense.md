## ✅ MODEL ANSWER (SPPU STYLE)

### Introduction (2 marks)

The **Right of Private Defense** is a fundamental right recognized under **Sections 34-44 of the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023**. It is based upon the **instinct of self-preservation**, which is inherent in every human being and has been acknowledged by law in all civilized societies.

**Legal Basis**: Section 34 BNS provides that nothing is an offense which is done in the exercise of the right of private defense.

**Nature of Right**: This right is **preventive and not punitive**. It arises when State protection is not immediately available, allowing individuals to protect themselves and others from imminent danger.

The right is available in **TWO situations**:
1. **Right of Private Defense of Body** (Sections 34-38)
2. **Right of Private Defense of Property** (Sections 39-44)

---

### PART I: Right of Private Defense of BODY (6 marks)

#### When Right Commences and Continues (1 mark)

The right of private defense of body:
- **Commences**: As soon as **reasonable apprehension of danger** to body arises from threat of offense
- **Continues**: As long as such apprehension of danger continues
- **Ceases**: When danger has passed or is no longer reasonably apprehended

**📌 Important**: No right exists against public servants acting in good faith in discharge of duty, even if their act is technically illegal.

---

#### 6 Situations When Right Extends to Causing DEATH (4 marks)

**Section 36 BNS** provides that the right of private defense of body extends to **voluntarily causing death** or any other harm to the assailant in the following **SIX situations**:

### 1️⃣ **Assault Causing Reasonable Apprehension of Death**

**Situation**: Such assault as may reasonably cause apprehension that death will otherwise be the consequence of such assault.

**Example**: A attacks B with a sharp weapon aimed at vital organs. B may cause death of A to protect himself.

**Rationale**: When life is threatened, extreme defense is justified to preserve life.

---

### 2️⃣ **Assault Causing Reasonable Apprehension of Grievous Hurt**

**Situation**: Such assault as may reasonably cause apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise be the consequence of such assault.

**What is Grievous Hurt**: Includes emasculation, permanent loss of sight/hearing, fracture, disfiguration, or any hurt endangering life.

**Example**: A attacks B with acid. B may cause death of A to prevent grievous hurt.

**Rationale**: Permanent bodily injury is serious enough to justify extreme defense.

---

### 3️⃣ **Assault with Intent to Commit Rape**

**Situation**: Assault with intention of committing rape.

**Scope**: Provides gender-neutral protection against sexual assault.

**Example**: A attempts to rape B. B may cause death of A in defense of her/his sexual autonomy.

**Rationale**: Protection of sexual autonomy and human dignity.

---

### 4️⃣ **Assault with Intent to Gratify Unnatural Lust**

**Situation**: Assault with intention of gratifying unnatural lust (includes sodomy and other unnatural sexual acts).

**Example**: A forcibly attempts unnatural sexual act on B. B may cause death of A to protect herself/himself.

**Rationale**: Protection against all forms of sexual violence.

---

### 5️⃣ **Assault with Intent to Kidnap or Abduct**

**Situation**: Assault with intention of kidnapping or abducting.

**Who Can Exercise**: The person being kidnapped/abducted or any other person witnessing the attempt.

**Example**: A attempts to kidnap B's child. B may cause death of A to prevent the kidnapping.

**Rationale**: Protection of personal liberty.

---

### 6️⃣ **Assault with Intent to Wrongfully Confine**

**Situation**: Assault with intention of wrongfully confining a person under circumstances which may reasonably cause apprehension that the person will be unable to have recourse to public authorities for release.

**Key Element**: Fear of being unable to access public authorities while confined.

**Example**: A forcibly drags B toward an isolated location. B may cause death of A if B believes he will be confined without access to help.

**Rationale**: Protection against unlawful confinement where State help unavailable.

---

#### When Right Does NOT Extend to Causing Death (1 mark)

**Section 37 BNS** provides that the right **NEVER extends to causing death** if:

1. **Time Available**: There is time to have recourse to protection of public authorities
2. **No Serious Harm**: Assault does not reasonably cause apprehension of death, grievous hurt, rape, unnatural lust, kidnapping, or wrongful confinement
3. **Proportionality**: More harm than necessary would be caused

**Principle**: **Proportionality** - defense must be proportionate to attack. One cannot use a gun against someone threatening a slap.

---

### PART II: Right of Private Defense of PROPERTY (6 marks)

#### When Right Commences and Continues (1 mark)

The right varies based on type of offense:

**Against Theft**: Commences when reasonable apprehension arises; continues till theft ceases

**Against Robbery**: Commences when robbery commences; continues while offender in commission or immediate flight

**Against Mischief/Trespass**: Commences when mischief/trespass commences; continues while offender engaged in it

---

#### 6 Situations When Right Extends to Causing DEATH (4 marks)

**Section 41 BNS** provides that the right of private defense of property extends to **voluntarily causing death** in the following **SIX situations**:

### 1️⃣ **ROBBERY**

**Definition**: Theft or extortion with use or threat of force.

**Scope**: Most dangerous form of property offense involving violence.

**Example**: Armed robbers enter A's house. A may cause death to prevent robbery.

**Rationale**: Robbery inherently dangerous as it involves threat to both person and property.

---

### 2️⃣ **House-Breaking by NIGHT**

**Definition**: House-breaking committed after sunset and before sunrise.

**Why Night-Time**: Greater danger in darkness, difficult to identify perpetrator, limited access to help.

**Example**: B breaks into A's house at 2 AM. A may cause death of B.

**Rationale**: Night-time intrusion creates heightened danger and vulnerability.

---

### 3️⃣ **Mischief by FIRE to Dwelling House**

**Definition**: Causing destruction or damage by fire to any building used as dwelling.

**Scope**: Arson to dwelling house endangers lives of occupants and causes extensive damage.

**Example**: A sets fire to B's house where B resides. B or anyone may cause death of A to prevent the fire.

**Rationale**: Fire to dwelling poses extreme danger to life and property.

---

### 4️⃣ **Theft, Mischief, or House-Trespass Under Aggravating Circumstances**

**Circumstances**: Committed by **night** AND under circumstances causing reasonable apprehension of death, grievous hurt, or assault with intent to commit rape or gratify unnatural lust.

**Key**: Night-time + reasonable apprehension of danger to person.

**Example**: A breaks into B's house at night with a weapon. Circumstances suggest danger to life. B may cause death of A.

**Rationale**: Combination of property offense and danger to person justifies extreme defense.

---

### 5️⃣ **Mischief by FIRE to Property (Not Dwelling)**

**Definition**: Causing destruction by fire to any property other than dwelling house.

**Scope**: Fire to shops, warehouses, factories, agricultural produce, forests, vehicles, machinery.

---

**Scope**: Bombing, explosives - extremely dangerous acts causing indiscriminate harm.

**Example**: A places bomb in B's property. Anyone may cause death of A to prevent explosion.

**Rationale**: Explosives create imminent danger to life and extensive property damage.

---

#### When Right Does NOT Extend to Causing Death (1 mark)

The right of private defense of property **NEVER extends to causing death** unless:

1. **Specific Situations**: Offense is one of the SIX situations listed in Section 41
2. **No Time**: There is no time to have recourse to protection of public authorities
3. **Danger to Person**: Reasonable apprehension exists that death, grievous hurt, or rape will result if defense not exercised
4. **Proportionality**: Only necessary harm is caused, not more

**Principle**: Property rights are less important than life. Death can be caused only in extreme circumstances where property offense also threatens life.

---

### Conclusion: General Principles (1 mark)

The Right of Private Defense operates under several **universal principles**:

1. **Good Faith**: Must be exercised with due care and attention, without malice
2. **Proportionality**: Force used must be proportionate to harm apprehended
3. **Preventive Nature**: Right exists to prevent harm, not to punish offender
4. **No Right Against Public Servants**: No right exists against public servants acting in good faith
5. **Available to Third Parties**: Can be exercised in defense of any person, not just oneself
6. **Burden of Proof**: Accused bears burden to prove right existed

**Exception to Murder**: If right of private defense is **exceeded in good faith**, the offense becomes **Culpable Homicide Not Amounting to Murder** (Exception 2 to Section 100), punishable with maximum 10 years instead of death/life imprisonment.

The Right of Private Defense thus balances the individual's instinct for self-preservation with society's interest in preventing excessive violence, ensuring that citizens can protect themselves when State protection is unavailable, while maintaining proportionality and good faith.
