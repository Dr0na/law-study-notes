### **INFANCY/MINORITY AS A DEFENSE**

#### **Introduction**

Infancy or minority is one of the important **general exceptions** under the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023, recognizing that children below a certain age lack the mental capacity to form criminal intent and understand the nature and consequences of their acts. The law provides **complete immunity** to very young children and **qualified immunity** to older children based on their maturity. This defense is founded on the principle that **criminal responsibility presupposes mental capacity** to distinguish between right and wrong.

**Relevant Provisions**: 
- **Section 20 BNS** (Previously Section 82 IPC) - Children below 7 years
- **Section 21 BNS** (Previously Section 83 IPC) - Children between 7-12 years

---

### **I. RATIONALE FOR INFANCY DEFENSE**

#### **1️⃣ Lack of Mental Capacity**

- Children lack **intellectual maturity** to understand wrongfulness
- Unable to form **mens rea** (guilty mind)
- Cannot appreciate consequences of actions

#### **2️⃣ Principle of Doli Incapax**

**"Doli incapax"** = **"Incapable of wrong"** or **"Incapable of crime"**

**Meaning**: Children below certain age presumed incapable of criminal intent

**Rationale**:
- Childhood is period of **innocence**
- Mind not developed to understand criminality
- Law presumes lack of criminal capacity

#### **3️⃣ Humanitarian Approach**

- Children need **protection and rehabilitation**, not punishment
- Focus on **welfare** rather than retribution
- Recognizes need for **reform and education**

#### **4️⃣ Public Policy**

- Society's interest in protecting children
- Avoiding stigma of criminalization
- Promoting child development and welfare

---

### **II. THREE AGE CATEGORIES**

The law divides children into **three distinct categories** based on age, with different levels of criminal responsibility:

---

### **CATEGORY 1: CHILDREN BELOW 7 YEARS**

#### **A. Provision (Section 20 BNS)**

**Previously Section 82 IPC**

**"Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under **seven years of age**."**

#### **B. Legal Effect**

✅ **ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY** from criminal liability

**Key Features**:
- **No criminal responsibility** whatsoever
- Irrebuttable presumption of incapacity
- Cannot be prosecuted for any offense
- No exceptions to this rule

#### **C. Rationale**

**Complete Absence of Mens Rea**:
- Child below 7 lacks mental maturity
- Cannot understand nature of act
- Cannot distinguish right from wrong
- Incapable of forming criminal intent

**Doli Incapax Presumption**:
- Absolute presumption - cannot be rebutted
- Law conclusively presumes child incapable of crime

#### **D. Practical Application**

**Example 1**:
- A child aged 6 years takes jewelry from shop
- Cannot be prosecuted for theft
- Complete immunity under Section 20

**Example 2**:
- A child aged 5 years fires gun, causing death
- Cannot be charged with murder
- No criminal liability regardless of act's seriousness

**Important Note**:
- While no criminal prosecution, child may be dealt with under **Juvenile Justice Act**
- Focus on care, protection, and rehabilitation

---

### **CATEGORY 2: CHILDREN BETWEEN 7-12 YEARS**

#### **A. Provision (Section 21 BNS)**

**Previously Section 83 IPC**

**"Nothing is an offence which is done by a child above **seven years of age** and under **twelve**, who has not attained sufficient maturity of understanding to judge of the **nature and consequences of his conduct** on that occasion."**

#### **B. Legal Effect**

⚠️ **QUALIFIED/CONDITIONAL IMMUNITY** from criminal liability

**Key Features**:
- **Presumption** of innocence (but rebuttable)
- Prosecution must prove child had **sufficient maturity**
- Burden on prosecution to show child understood act
- Immunity applies if maturity NOT proved

#### **C. Two Tests to Determine Liability**

**Test 1: Maturity of Understanding**
- Did child have sufficient intellectual development?
- Could child comprehend nature of act?

**Test 2: Nature and Consequences**
- Did child understand what he/she was doing?
- Did child appreciate consequences of conduct?

**Both tests must be satisfied** for criminal liability

#### **D. Factors Considered**

Courts consider various factors to determine maturity:

**1️⃣ Nature of Act**:
- Complexity of crime
- Whether act shows planning/premeditation
- Degree of deliberation involved

**2️⃣ Child's Behavior**:
- Conduct before, during, and after act
- Attempts to hide crime
- Understanding of wrongfulness

**3️⃣ Individual Circumstances**:
- Child's education level
- Social environment
- Previous conduct
- Mental development

**4️⃣ Evidence of Understanding**:
- Statements by child
- Child's explanations
- Awareness of legal/moral wrong

#### **E. Burden of Proof**

**On Prosecution to prove**:
1. Child had attained sufficient maturity
2. Child understood nature of act
3. Child understood consequences

**If NOT proved** → Child gets immunity under Section 21

#### **F. Practical Application**

**Example 1: Immunity Applied**:
- Child aged 10 takes money from parent's purse
- No evidence of understanding theft concept
- Acts on impulse without appreciating wrongfulness
- **Result**: Immunity under Section 21

**Example 2: No Immunity**:
- Child aged 11 plans theft, breaks into house at night
- Takes valuables, hides them, lies when questioned
- Shows understanding of wrongfulness
- **Result**: Can be prosecuted (if maturity proved)

#### **G. Doli Incapax Principle**

**For 7-12 age group**:
- **Rebuttable presumption** of doli incapax
- Presumed incapable unless prosecution proves otherwise
- Benefit of doubt goes to child

---

### **CATEGORY 3: CHILDREN ABOVE 12 YEARS (OR ADULTS)**

#### **A. Legal Position**

**No provision for immunity**

**Legal Effect**:
- **Full criminal responsibility**
- Treated as adults for criminal law purposes
- No presumption of incapacity

#### **B. Rationale**

- By age 12, sufficient mental development presumed
- Can understand nature and consequences of acts
- Can form requisite mens rea

#### **C. Important Note - Juvenile Justice Act**

While **criminally liable**, special laws apply:

**For persons below 18 years** (even if above 12):
- **Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015** applies
- Separate juvenile justice system
- Different trial procedures
- Focus on rehabilitation over punishment

**Exception for heinous crimes**:
- Children 16-18 years committing **heinous offenses**
- May be tried as adults (after assessment)

### **III. COMPARATIVE TABLE**

| **Age Category** | **Section** | **Immunity** | **Presumption** | **Example** |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Below 7 years** | Section 20 BNS | ✅ **ABSOLUTE** | Irrebuttable | 6-year-old takes toy |
| **7-12 years** | Section 21 BNS | ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** | Rebuttable | 10-year-old commits act |
| **Above 12 years** | No provision | ❌ **NONE** | Full liability | 13-year-old treated as adult |

---

### **IV. DOLI INCAPAX - DETAILED EXPLANATION**

#### **Meaning**

**Doli incapax** = **"Incapable of wrong"** or **"Incapable of evil intent"**

**Legal Principle**: Children below certain age are incapable of forming criminal intent.

#### **Application in Law**

**Below 7 years**:
- **Conclusive** presumption of doli incapax
- Cannot be rebutted
- Absolute protection

**7-12 years**:
- **Rebuttable** presumption of doli incapax
- Presumed incapable unless proved otherwise
- Protection unless prosecution shows maturity

**Above 12 years**:
- **No presumption** of doli incapax
- Presumed capable of crime
- Full criminal responsibility

---

### **V. PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS**

#### **1️⃣ Determination of Age**

- Age determined from birth certificate, school records
- Medical examination if age uncertain
- Benefit of doubt in favor of child if age disputed

#### **2️⃣ Juvenile Justice Act**

- Children in conflict with law dealt under JJ Act
- Separate juvenile justice boards
- Focus on **best interest of child**
- **Reformation**, not punishment

#### **3️⃣ Serious Crimes**

Even with immunity under Sections 20-21:
- Child may be placed under **care and protection**
- Counseling and rehabilitation provided
- Parents/guardians may be counseled
- Focus on preventing recurrence

---

### **Conclusion**

The provisions relating to infancy under Sections 20 and 21 of BNS 2023 reflect the law's recognition that **children are not miniature adults** and lack the mental capacity to be held criminally responsible. The law creates a **graded system** - children below 7 years receive **absolute immunity** based on conclusive presumption of doli incapax; children between 7-12 years receive **qualified immunity** based on rebuttable presumption, requiring prosecution to prove sufficient maturity; and children above 12 years are deemed **fully responsible** though subject to juvenile justice provisions if below 18 years.

This humane approach balances the need for **social protection** with recognition of **childhood vulnerability and developmental stages**. The underlying philosophy is that **childhood is a period of innocence and learning**, and the focus should be on **reformation and rehabilitation** rather than punishment. The principle of doli incapax ensures that criminal law does not treat children who lack mental maturity as criminals, promoting their welfare and ensuring justice appropriate to their developmental stage.
