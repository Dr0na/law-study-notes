### **CRIMINAL BREACH OF TRUST**

#### **Introduction**

Criminal Breach of Trust is an important offense against property under the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023, defined in **Section 316 BNS** (previously Section 405 IPC). It involves a breach of trust relationship where a person who is entrusted with property or dominion over property dishonestly misappropriates or converts it to his own use. Unlike theft, where property is taken without consent, Criminal Breach of Trust (CBT) involves betrayal of confidence reposed in the accused. It is considered a serious offense as it violates the fundamental principle of trust in human relationships and commercial transactions.

### **I. DEFINITION (Section 316 BNS)**

**"Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use that property, or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract, express or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust, or willfully suffers any other person so to do, commits criminal breach of trust."**

### **II. 4 ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS OF CRIMINAL BREACH OF TRUST**

---

### **1️⃣ ENTRUSTMENT OF PROPERTY OR DOMINION OVER PROPERTY**

#### **Requirement**: There must be **entrustment** of property to the accused

**Entrustment Means**:
- Property is delivered or handed over to accused
- Accused given custody, control, or dominion over property
- Relationship of trust created

**Two Forms**:

**(a) Entrustment with Property**:
- Actual physical custody given
- Example: Money handed over to agent

**(b) Entrustment with Dominion Over Property**:
- Control or authority over property given
- May not have physical custody
- Example: Power of attorney to manage property

#### **Characteristics of Entrustment**

**1. Lawful Entrustment**:
- Property must be entrusted **lawfully**
- Not taken without permission or stolen

**2. Capacity in Which Entrusted**:
- Could be as agent, banker, trustee, executor, employee, etc.
- Any fiduciary or trust relationship

**3. Ownership NOT Transferred**:
- Accused gets only **custody/control**, not ownership
- Property still belongs to entruster

#### **Examples of Entrustment**

**Example 1**: Banker-Customer
- Customer deposits money with bank
- Bank entrusted with money
- Bank has dominion over money

**Example 2**: Agent-Principal
- Principal hands goods to agent to sell
- Agent entrusted with goods
- Agent has custody

**Example 3**: Employee-Employer
- Employer gives cash to employee to deposit in bank
- Employee entrusted with cash

- Includes proceeds, substitutes, or replacements

**Example**:

### **4️⃣ VIOLATION OF LEGAL DIRECTION OR CONTRACT**

### **IV. DISTINCTION: Criminal Breach of Trust vs Theft**

| **Aspect** | **THEFT** | **CRIMINAL BREACH OF TRUST** |
|------------|----------|------------------------------|
| **Entrustment** | ❌ No entrustment | ✅ Property **entrusted** to accused |
| **Taking** | **Without consent** | With consent (entrusted lawfully) |
| **Possession** | Takes from **possession of another** | Already in **possession** (entrusted) |
| **Breach** | No trust relationship | **Breach of trust** relationship |
| **Manner** | Secretly/stealthily | By **misappropriation/conversion** |
| **Relationship** | No prior relationship needed | **Fiduciary/trust** relationship required |
| **Example** | Pickpocketing | Agent misusing client's money |
| **Punishment** | Up to 3 years + fine (Sec 303) | Up to 3 years + fine (Sec 316) |

**Key Difference**: 
- **Theft**: Property taken **without consent**
- **CBT**: Property **entrusted with consent**, then betrayed

### **Conclusion**

Criminal Breach of Trust is a serious offense that strikes at the foundation of trust relationships in society. It requires four essential elements: (1) entrustment of property or dominion over property, (2) dishonest misappropriation or conversion to own use, (3) property being that which was entrusted, and (4) violation of legal direction or contract. Unlike theft, where property is taken without consent, CBT involves betrayal of confidence where property was lawfully entrusted. The offense recognizes that breach of trust is as harmful, if not more, than forcible taking, as it erodes the foundation of commercial and personal relationships. The law punishes such betrayal proportionately, with enhanced punishment when committed by persons in positions of greater trust such as public servants, bankers, or merchants, reflecting the greater responsibility and trust reposed in them.
