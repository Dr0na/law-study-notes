### **UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY**

#### **Introduction**

Unlawful Assembly is an offense against public tranquility under the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023, defined in **Section 189 BNS** (previously Section 141 IPC). It deals with situations where a group of persons assembles with a common unlawful object that threatens public peace and order. The offense recognizes that collective action with criminal intent poses greater danger to society than individual action, even if no actual violence occurs. The law intervenes at the stage of assembly itself to prevent potential breaches of peace and public disorder.

#### **Definition (Section 189 BNS)**

**"An assembly of five or more persons is designated an 'unlawful assembly' if the common object of the persons composing that assembly is:**

**(i) To overawe by criminal force, or show of criminal force, the Central Government or any State Government or Parliament or the Legislature of any State, or any public servant in the exercise of the lawful power of such public servant; or**

**(ii) To resist the execution of any law, or of any legal process; or**

**(iii) To commit any mischief or criminal trespass, or other offence; or**

**(iv) By means of criminal force, or show of criminal force, to any person, to take or obtain possession of any property, or to deprive any person of the enjoyment of a right of way, or of the use of water or other incorporeal right of which he is in possession or enjoyment, or to enforce any right or supposed right; or**

**(v) By means of criminal force, or show of criminal force, to compel any person to do what he is not legally bound to do, or to omit to do what he is legally entitled to do."**

### **5 ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS OF UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY**

---

### **1️⃣ ASSEMBLY OF FIVE OR MORE PERSONS**

**Requirement**: Minimum **five persons** must be present

**Key Points**:
- **Number**: Less than 5 persons = NOT unlawful assembly
- Exactly 5 or more than 5 persons required
- Persons need not know each other
- Can assemble at one time or join gradually

**Example**:
- 4 persons gather with unlawful object = NOT unlawful assembly
- 5 persons gather with unlawful object = CAN be unlawful assembly (if other elements satisfied)

**Important**: If some members acquitted/exonerated, but 5 remain, still unlawful assembly.

---

### **2️⃣ COMMON OBJECT**

**Requirement**: Persons must have **common object** (shared purpose)

**"Common Object"**:
- Shared aim or purpose
- Collective intent
- Need not be **common intention** (different concept)

**Distinction - Common Object vs Common Intention**:

| **Common Object** | **Common Intention** |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Shared purpose of group | Prearranged plan |
| May develop on spot | Requires prior concert |
| Object known to all | Specific shared plan |
| For Unlawful Assembly | For Section 34 BNS (common intention) |

**Key Point**: Common object can be formed spontaneously at assembly.

---

### **3️⃣ UNLAWFUL COMMON OBJECT**

**Requirement**: The common object must be **unlawful** - must fall under one of **five categories** specified in Section 189:

**Category (i): Overawe Government/Public Servant**
- Overawe by criminal force or show of criminal force
- Target: Central/State Government, Parliament, Legislature, or public servant
- Intent to prevent lawful exercise of power

**Category (ii): Resist Execution of Law**
- Resist execution of law or legal process
- Example: Resisting court order, preventing police from arresting

**Category (iii): Commit Mischief, Trespass, or Other Offense**
- Intent to commit any mischief or criminal trespass or other offense
- Broadest category

**Category (iv): Take Possession by Force**
- By criminal force, take or obtain possession of property
- Deprive person of right of way, water, or other incorporeal right
- Enforce any right or supposed right

**Category (v): Compel Any Person**
- By criminal force, compel person to:
  - Do what he is NOT legally bound to do, OR
  - Omit to do what he IS legally entitled to do

---

### **4️⃣ ASSEMBLY MUST ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE**

**Requirement**: The assembly must have **actually assembled**

**Key Points**:
- Not mere intention to assemble
- Must physically come together
- Can be at any place (public or private)
- Duration immaterial (even momentary assembly sufficient)

---

### **5️⃣ MEMBERS AWARE OF COMMON OBJECT**

**Requirement**: Members of assembly must be **aware** of the common unlawful object

**Test**: Did member know the common object when joining/continuing?

**Key Points**:
- Person joining must know object is unlawful
- If joins innocent assembly that later becomes unlawful, must know of change
- Can be inferred from conduct and circumstances

**Exception**: Person who joins innocent assembly and leaves before it becomes unlawful - NOT liable

---

### **PUNISHMENT (Section 190 BNS)**

**Being Member of Unlawful Assembly**:
- Imprisonment up to **6 months**, OR
- Fine up to **Rs. 5000**, OR
- Both

**If Assembled with Deadly Weapons**:
- Imprisonment up to **2 years**, OR
- Fine, OR
- Both

---

### **EXAMPLES**

**Example 1**:
- 7 persons assemble outside court
- Common object: Resist police from arresting their friend
- All aware of object
- This is **unlawful assembly** under category (ii)

**Example 2**:
- 10 persons gather near disputed land
- Common object: Forcibly take possession of land
- This is **unlawful assembly** under category (iv)

**Example 3**:
- 6 persons assemble
- Common object: Commit mischief by damaging property
- This is **unlawful assembly** under category (iii)

---

### **RELATED CONCEPT: RIOTING**

**Section 191 BNS (Rioting)**:
- If unlawful assembly uses **force or violence**
- It becomes **rioting**
- More serious offense
- Punishment: Imprisonment up to 2 years + fine

**Relationship**:
```
Unlawful Assembly + Use of Force = Rioting
```

---

### **Conclusion**

Unlawful Assembly under Section 189 BNS requires five essential ingredients: (1) assembly of minimum five persons, (2) common object shared by members, (3) common object must be unlawful falling under five specified categories, (4) actual assembly taking place, and (5) members aware of common object. The offense is designed to prevent **collective action** with unlawful objectives that threatens **public tranquility**. 

Even though no actual violence may occur, the mere assembly of five or more persons with unlawful common object is punishable, reflecting the law's preventive approach. The common object must fall under one of five categories: overawing Government, resisting law, committing offenses, taking possession by force, or compelling persons by force. If the assembly proceeds to use actual force, it escalates to **rioting** (Section 191 BNS), attracting higher punishment and reflecting greater threat to public order.
