### **SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM**

#### **Issue**

The issue is whether A, the police constable, can claim the defense of **mistake of fact** under **Section 14 of the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023** (previously Section 76 of IPC) for arresting an innocent person C believing him to be criminal B.

---

#### **Relevant Law**

**Section 14 BNS** provides: "Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is, or who by reason of a **mistake of fact** and not by reason of a mistake of law in **good faith** believes that he is, **bound by law** to do it."

**Essential Requirements**:

1️⃣ **Mistake of Fact**: Person must act by reason of mistake about factual circumstances

2️⃣ **Good Faith**: Act must be done honestly with **due care and attention**

3️⃣ **Belief of Being Bound by Law**: Person must believe he is under legal compulsion to do the act

**Good Faith** (Section 2(10) BNS): Requires honesty and **due care**. Due care depends on:
- Nature of the act
- Magnitude and importance
- Facility person has for exercise of care

---

#### **Application to Facts**

**Analyzing A's Actions**:

**1. Was there a Mistake of Fact?**
- ✅ **YES** - A mistook C's identity for B
- A believed the person was B (notorious criminal)
- Actually it was C (innocent man)
- This is a mistake about **factual circumstance** (identity)
- NOT a mistake about law

**2. Did A believe he was Bound by Law?**
- ✅ **YES** - A believed he was bound by law to arrest B
- A had reliable information about B
- A had a valid **search warrant**
- Police constables have legal duty to arrest criminals
- A thought he was executing lawful duty

**3. Was the mistake made in Good Faith?**

**Analysis of Good Faith**:

**✅ HONESTY**: 
- A acted honestly - genuinely believed person was B
- No malice or ill-will toward C
- Acting in course of duty

**✅ DUE CARE**:

*Factor 1 - Nature of Act*:
- Arresting a criminal is serious matter
- But routine police duty
- Requires reasonable care

*Factor 2 - Magnitude*:
- Important to catch notorious criminal
- But equally important not to arrest wrong person
- Balance required

*Factor 3 - Facility to Exercise Care*:
- A had **reliable information**
- Person had **striking resemblance** to B
- Difficult to distinguish look-alikes
- A went with **proper warrant**
- Not reckless or negligent

**Conclusion on Good Faith**:
- A acted with **due care** in the circumstances
- Had reliable information
- Person looked exactly like B
- Had proper legal authority (warrant)
- Genuine difficulty in identification
- Therefore, acted in **GOOD FAITH**

---

#### **Relevant Case Law**

**State of West Bengal v. Shew Mangal Singh**: 
Supreme Court held that if a police officer acts pursuant to lawful order of superior officer in conformity with law and in good faith, Section 76 (now Section 14) protection is available.

**Principle**: If the mistaken belief is reasonable and act done with due care, officer is protected.

---

#### **Conclusion**

**A CANNOT be held liable for wrongful confinement** because:

1. A acted by reason of **mistake of fact** (mistaken identity)
2. The mistake was **reasonable** - C bore striking resemblance to B
3. A believed he was **bound by law** to arrest B
4. A acted in **good faith** with due care:
   - Had reliable information
   - Had proper warrant
   - Person looked exactly like B
   - Not reckless or negligent
5. All conditions of **Section 14 BNS** are satisfied

**Therefore**, A is **protected by the defense of mistake of fact** and cannot be held criminally liable for wrongful confinement of C.

**However**, C may have a **civil remedy** for damages for wrongful confinement, but A will have immunity from **criminal prosecution**.
