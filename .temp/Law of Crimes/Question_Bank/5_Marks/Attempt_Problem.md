## ✅ Model Answer

### **SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM**

#### **Issue**

The issue is whether A can be charged with **attempt to commit theft** under **Section 62 of the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023** (previously Section 511 of IPC) when he broke open the cupboard but found it empty.

---

#### **Relevant Law**

**Section 62 BNS** provides: "Whoever attempts to commit an offence punishable by this Code with imprisonment for life or imprisonment, or to cause such an offence to be committed, and in such attempt **does any act towards the commission** of the offence, shall, where no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such attempt, be punished with imprisonment of any description provided for the offence, for a term which may extend to one-half of the imprisonment..."

**Essential Ingredients of Attempt**:

1️⃣ **Offence Punishable with Imprisonment**
- The intended offense must be punishable with imprisonment for life or term

2️⃣ **Does Any Act Toward Commission**
- Accused must have done some **overt act** toward commission of offense
- Not mere preparation
- Must cross the line from preparation to attempt

3️⃣ **No Express Provision for Attempt**
- Section 62 applies only when no specific provision exists for punishing attempt

**Preparation vs Attempt**: 
- **Preparation** = Remote from crime, arranging means
- **Attempt** = Proximate to crime, direct movement toward commission

---

#### **Application to Facts**

**Analyzing A's Actions**:

**1. Was the Intended Offense Punishable with Imprisonment?**
- ✅ **YES** - Theft is punishable under Section 303 BNS
- Punishment: Imprisonment up to 3 years + fine
- Therefore, first ingredient satisfied

**2. Did A Do Any Act Toward Commission of Theft?**

**Analysis**:

**A's Actions**:
- Entered B's house at **night**
- With **intention** of committing theft
- **Broke open** the cupboard
- Failed only because cupboard was **empty**

**Preparation or Attempt?**

*Stage 1 - Intention*:
- A formed intention to steal → Just mental state (not punishable)

*Stage 2 - Preparation*:
- Planning to enter house → Preparation (not punishable)
- Going to the house → Could be preparation

*Stage 3 - Attempt*:
- ✅ **Entering house at night** with intention to steal
- ✅ **Breaking open cupboard** to steal
- These are **OVERT ACTS** toward commission of theft
- Directly aimed at committing theft
- **Proximate** to the offense, not remote

**Conclusion on This Element**: 
A has **crossed the line from preparation to attempt**. Breaking open the cupboard is a **direct act toward commission** of theft.

**3. Is Impossibility a Defense?**

**Factual Impossibility**:
- Cupboard was empty - no property to steal
- This is **factual impossibility**

**Legal Position**:
- ❌ **Factual impossibility is NOT a defense** to attempt
- Even if offense cannot be completed due to circumstances unknown to accused, attempt is still punishable

**Illustration (a) from Section 62**:
"A makes an attempt to steal some jewels by breaking open a box, and finds after so opening the box that there is no jewel in it. He has done an act towards the commission of theft and therefore is guilty under this section."

**This illustration exactly matches our facts!**

**4. No Express Provision for Attempt to Theft?**
- ✅ There is NO specific provision for "attempt to commit theft" in BNS
- Therefore, Section 62 (general provision) applies

---

#### **Relevant Case Law**

**Abhayanand Mishra v. State of Bihar** (AIR 1961 SC 1698):
Supreme Court held that a person commits attempt when:
1. He intends to commit offense
2. Having made preparations, does an act toward its commission
3. Act need not be **penultimate act** but must be act **during course** of committing offense

**Principle**: The moment accused dispatches or does overt act toward commission, he enters realm of attempting to commit offense.

---

#### **Conclusion**

**YES, A can be charged with attempt to commit theft** under **Section 62 BNS** because:

1. ✅ Theft is punishable with imprisonment
2. ✅ A did overt acts toward commission:
   - Entered house at night with intention to steal
   - Broke open cupboard to steal
3. ✅ Acts were **proximate** to theft, not mere preparation
4. ✅ Breaking open cupboard is **direct step** toward theft
5. ✅ Factual impossibility (empty cupboard) is **NO defense**
6. ✅ Section 62 illustration (a) exactly covers this situation
7. ✅ No express provision for attempt to theft, so Section 62 applies

**Punishment**: 
- Theft: Imprisonment up to 3 years + fine
- Attempt to theft: Up to **1.5 years** (half of 3 years) + fine

**Therefore**, A is guilty of **attempt to commit theft** under Section 62 BNS.

## 🔄 Alternative Problem Solution

**Problem**: X points loaded revolver at Y to kill, Z intervenes and snatches gun. Can X be prosecuted?

**Solution**:

**Issue**: Whether X committed attempt to murder?

**Law**: 
- **Section 109 BNS** (Attempt to murder) - Express provision exists
- Section 62 does NOT apply (express provision present)

**Application**:
1. ✅ Intention to kill present
2. ✅ Overt act done - **pointing loaded gun** at victim
3. ✅ Act **proximate** to commission of murder
4. ✅ Failure due to intervention, not lack of intent
5. ✅ Act was during course of committing murder

**Conclusion**: **YES, X can be prosecuted** for **attempt to murder** under **Section 109 BNS**.

**Punishment**: Imprisonment up to 10 years + fine

**Note**: Since express provision (Section 109) exists, Section 62 does NOT apply.
