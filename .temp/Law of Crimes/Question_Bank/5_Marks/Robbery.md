### **ROBBERY**

#### **Introduction**

Robbery is a serious offense against property under **Section 309 of the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023** (previously Section 390 IPC). It is an aggravated form of theft or extortion, distinguished by the use of **force or threat of violence**. Robbery combines property offense with offense against person, making it more serious than simple theft. The essence of robbery is that it involves both **taking of property** (theft/extortion) and **violence or intimidation** (force/threat).

---

#### **Definition (Section 309 BNS)**

**Robbery** is either **theft** or **extortion** when, in order to commit theft or extortion, or in committing theft or extortion, or in carrying away property obtained by theft or extortion, the offender:
- Voluntarily causes or attempts to cause **death, hurt, or wrongful restraint**, OR
- Puts any person in **fear of instant death, hurt, or wrongful restraint**

---

### **5 ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS OF ROBBERY**

---

### **1️⃣ THEFT OR EXTORTION MUST OCCUR**

**Base Requirement**: There must be **theft** (Section 303) OR **extortion** (Section 308)

**Theft**: Dishonest taking of movable property without consent

**Extortion**: Dishonestly inducing person to deliver property by putting in fear

**Formula**: **Robbery = Theft/Extortion + Force/Threat**

**Key Point**: Robbery builds upon theft or extortion - without underlying theft/extortion, no robbery.

---

### **2️⃣ VOLUNTARY CAUSING OR ATTEMPT TO CAUSE DEATH, HURT, OR WRONGFUL RESTRAINT**

**Requirement**: Offender voluntarily causes or attempts to cause:
- **Death**, OR
- **Hurt** (bodily pain, disease, or infirmity), OR
- **Wrongful restraint** (restricting person from going somewhere)

**"Voluntarily"**: Intentional use of force, not accidental

**Examples**:
- Hitting victim with weapon before snatching property
- Pushing victim to ground and taking wallet
- Restraining victim while accomplice takes property

**Key Point**: Actual violence used on person

---

### **3️⃣ PUTTING PERSON IN FEAR OF INSTANT HARM**

**Requirement**: Put person in **fear of instant** (immediate):
- Death, OR
- Hurt, OR
- Wrongful restraint

**"Instant"**: 
- Immediate threat, not future harm
- Fear of harm happening right now
- Not deferred or delayed threat

**Examples**:
- Pointing gun at person demanding wallet (fear of instant death)
- Threatening with knife to hand over jewelry (fear of instant hurt)
- "Give money now or I'll kill you" (instant threat)

**NOT Robbery**:
- "Give money tomorrow or I'll harm you" (not instant - this is extortion only)
- Future threat = Extortion, not robbery

---

### **4️⃣ FORCE MUST BE ON PERSON**

**Requirement**: Force or threat must be against **person**, not only against property

**On the Person**: 
- Whose property is taken, OR
- Any person present at the time

**Examples**:

✅ **Robbery** (Force on person):
- Hitting owner before taking property
- Threatening guard to hand over keys
- Pushing person and snatching purse

❌ **NOT Robbery** (Force only on property):
- Breaking lock of car to steal (no force on person - only theft)
- Breaking into empty house (no person present - only house-breaking)

**Key Distinction**:
- Force against **property only** = Theft
- Force against **person** + taking property = Robbery

---

### **5️⃣ FORCE USED IN ORDER TO COMMIT THEFT/EXTORTION OR SECURE PROPERTY**

**Timing of Force**: Force can be used at three stages:

**Stage 1: BEFORE Taking**
- Force used **in order to** commit theft/extortion
- Example: Hitting person, then taking wallet

**Stage 2: WHILE Taking**
- Force used **in committing** theft/extortion
- Example: Snatching chain forcefully from neck

**Stage 3: AFTER Taking**
- Force used **in carrying away** property
- Example: Snatching purse, then pushing victim who tries to stop

**All three scenarios = ROBBERY**

**Key Point**: Force can be before, during, or after taking - all constitute robbery if other elements satisfied.

---

### **EXAMPLES OF ROBBERY**

**Example 1**: Highway Robbery
- A stops B's car on highway
- Points gun at B (fear of instant death)
- Demands money and jewelry
- B hands over valuables
- This is **Robbery** (Extortion + Fear of instant harm + Force on person)

**Example 2**: Snatching
- A forcefully snatches gold chain from B's neck
- B injured in process
- This is **Robbery** (Theft + Force causing hurt)

**Example 3**: Bank Robbery
- Gang enters bank with weapons
- Threatens cashiers (fear of instant harm)
- Takes cash
- This is **Robbery** (may be Dacoity if 5+ persons)

---

### **DISTINCTION: Theft vs Robbery**

| **Theft** | **Robbery** |
|----------|-----------|
| Without consent | Without consent + **Force/threat** |
| No force/violence | **Violence essential** |
| Secretly taking | Taking by **force or intimidation** |
| Less serious | More serious |
| Up to 3 years | Up to 10 years |
| Pickpocketing | Snatching with force |

**Key**: Robbery is **aggravated theft** - theft plus force/threat

---

### **PUNISHMENT (Section 309 BNS)**

**Simple Robbery**:
- Imprisonment up to **10 years** + fine

**Robbery with Hurt** (Section 311 BNS):
- **Life imprisonment** OR up to 10 years + fine

**Dacoity** (Section 310 BNS):
- If 5+ persons commit robbery conjointly
- Life imprisonment or up to 10 years + fine

---

### **Conclusion**

Robbery is an aggravated form of theft or extortion, distinguished by the essential element of **force or threat of instant harm**. The five essential ingredients - underlying theft/extortion, voluntary causing or attempt to cause harm, putting in fear of instant harm, force on persons, and force used to facilitate taking - must all be satisfied for offense to constitute robbery. The punishment reflects the dual nature of offense - harm to both property and person - with up to 10 years imprisonment, escalating to life imprisonment when hurt is caused. Robbery is thus a **composite offense** combining property crime with crime against person, justifying its treatment as one of the most serious offenses against property.
