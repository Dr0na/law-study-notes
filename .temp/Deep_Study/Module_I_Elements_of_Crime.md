## 📝 What is Crime?

### ⚖️ Definition of Crime

Crime may be defined as **an act or omission which society has thought fit to punish or otherwise deal with under its laws for the time being in force**.

### 🧠 Definitions by Legal Scholars

1️⃣ **Blackstone**
- "An act committed or omitted in violation of public law forbidding or commanding it"

2️⃣ **Glanville Williams**
- "A crime is a legal wrong that can be followed by criminal proceedings which may result in punishment"

3️⃣ **Professor Kenny**
- "Crime is a harmful human conduct that sovereign desires to prevent"

4️⃣ **Salmond**
- "An act deemed by law to be harmful to society in general even though its immediate victim is an individual"

5️⃣ **John Austin**
- "A wrong which is pursued by the sovereign or his subordinates is a crime"

---

## 🔑 Cardinal Principle of Criminal Law

### ⚖️ The Fundamental Maxim

**"Actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea"**

**Meaning**: An act does not make a person guilty of a crime unless the mind is also guilty.

### 📌 Implications

- There must be BOTH:
  - A prohibited act (Actus Reus)
  - A guilty state of mind (Mens Rea)
- Exception: **Strict Liability Offences** (no mens rea required)
- Difference between:
  - Accident causing injury
  - Deliberate act causing injury

---

## 🧩 2 Essential Elements of Crime

### 1️⃣ Actus Reus (Physical Element)

#### 📘 Definition

**Actus Reus** is the **deed of commission**, a material result of human conduct that the law seeks to prevent.

- **Actus** = Deed
- **Reus** = Guilty/Wrongful
- It is the **physical/external element** of crime

#### 🔹 Characteristics of Actus Reus

**Nature**:
- Result of active conduct of the offender
- An event that occurs due to conduct
- Must be distinguished from the conduct itself

**Example**:
- In murder by stabbing:
  - **Actus Reus** = Death of victim (the result)
  - **Conduct** = Stabbing (the act that caused the result)

#### 🔹 When Act Does NOT Constitute Offence

**Lawful Authority**:
- Law commands or permits the harm
- Example: Duly appointed executioner putting condemned criminal to death
- No criminal liability arises

#### 🔹 Causation in Actus Reus

**Principle**: An event may be caused by one factor if it would not have happened without that factor.

**Test**: A person causes actus reus if that actus would not have occurred without his participation.

#### 🔹 5 Categories of Physical Participation

1️⃣ **No Physical Participation**
- Procuring or advising another to commit crime
- Equal responsibility with actual perpetrator
- Dealt under: Incitement and Conspiracy

2️⃣ **Indirect Participation**
- Actus reus attributed to one who causes innocent person to act under mistake
- **Example**: A puts poison in drink knowing B will offer it to C

3️⃣ **Intervening Person**
- Another person intervened more immediately and directly
- **📌 Case**: R v. Hilton
  - Prisoner in charge of steam engine stopped it and went away
  - Unauthorized person set engine in motion during absence
  - Death occurred
  - **Held**: Death not consequence of prisoner's act, but of unauthorized person's act

4️⃣ **Victim's Own Conduct Affected Result**
- Offender may be convicted if:
  - (a) Result would have occurred even without victim's subsequent conduct
  - (b) Result occurred although victim could have taken remedial action
- **📌 Case**: R v. Martin
  - Prisoner gave gin to 4-year-old son
  - Child snatched glass and drank liquor
  - Child died
  - **Held**: Prisoner acquitted - death followed because of child's own act

5️⃣ **Contributory Negligence of Victim**
- Victim's contributory negligence affords NO defense in criminal proceedings
- Unlike civil law, criminal law holds accused liable regardless
- **📌 Case**: R v. Swindall and Osborne
  - Prisoners driving horse and cart dangerously
  - Ran over and killed pedestrian
  - **Held**: Immaterial whether deceased was drunk or negligent

---

### 2️⃣ Mens Rea (Mental Element)

#### 📘 Definition

**Mens Rea** means the **evil intent** or **guilty state of mind**.

- Refers to **psychological state** or **desire** to bring about contemplated result
- The **mental/internal element** of crime

#### 🔹 2 Tests to Determine Mens Rea

1️⃣ **Whether the act is voluntary?**
- Section 39 of IPC (now BNS) defines "voluntarily"

2️⃣ **Whether accused had foresight of consequences?**
- Did the person foresee what would happen?

#### 🔹 4 Degrees of Mens Rea

### 1️⃣ **INTENTION**

**Definition**: To have a fixed purpose to reach a desired objective

**Characteristics**:
- Person not only **foresees** but also **wills** the possible consequences
- Highest degree of mens rea
- Cannot be intention without:
  - Foreseeability of consequences
  - Willingness to turn foreseeability into reality

**Example**:
- If a man chops off head of another:
  - He foresees death
  - He also wills to cause death
  - This is INTENTION

**Illustration**:
- A shoots B at point-blank range in the heart
- A clearly intends to kill B

---

### 2️⃣ **KNOWLEDGE**

**Definition**: Awareness on the part of person that his mind is aware of possible consequences of his conduct

**Characteristics**:
- Awareness of consequences
- May not have intention to cause result
- But knows the result will/may follow

**📌 Case**: Basdev v. State of PEPSU
- **Held**: Knowledge is awareness of consequences of the act
- In many cases, intention and knowledge merge and mean the same thing
- Intention can be presumed from knowledge

**Distinction from Intention**:
- **Intention**: Desire + foresight + willing
- **Knowledge**: Awareness without necessarily willing

**Example**:
- Doctor uses infected syringe knowingly on patient
- Infects patient with terminal disease
- Act by itself won't cause immediate death
- But doctor has KNOWLEDGE that actions will lead to death
- No INTENTION to kill, but KNOWLEDGE of consequences

---

### 3️⃣ **RECKLESSNESS**

**Definition**: Knowingly running the risk of bringing about unwished results

**Characteristics**:
- Person foresees possible/probable consequences
- Does NOT desire them to happen
- Despite this, knowingly runs the risk
- May prefer that event shall not happen
- Does not act with purpose that it shall happen
- But knowingly takes the risk anyway

**Example**:
- A drives at 120 km/h in crowded market
- Foresees possibility of hitting someone
- Does not want to hit anyone
- But continues driving recklessly
- This is RECKLESSNESS

**Distinction from Intention and Knowledge**:
- **Intention**: Wants the result
- **Knowledge**: Knows result will follow
- **Recklessness**: Doesn't want result, but takes conscious risk

---

### 4️⃣ **NEGLIGENCE**

**Definition**: Blameworthy inadvertence where person may not have foreseen probable/possible consequences

**Characteristics**:
- NO foreseeability of possible consequences
- Breach of duty of care
- Man brought harm upon another through inadvertence
- Obligation to make reparations

**Under BNS (formerly IPC)**:
- Incorporated specifically for death caused by negligence
- Section 304A IPC (now corresponding BNS section)
- Essentially a principle of tort law

**Example**:
- A leaves banana peel on stairs
- Does not foresee anyone will slip
- B slips and breaks leg
- A was NEGLIGENT

**Distinction**:
- **Recklessness**: Foresees risk but takes it
- **Negligence**: Does not foresee risk at all

---

## 🔄 Motive vs Intention

### 🔹 Motive

**Definition**: Psychological phenomenon which compels/tempts person to do a particular act

**Characteristics**:
- Like a "spring" that pushes intention further (Austin)
- Leads or tempts the mind to indulge in an act
- Triggers mens rea
- Can be good or bad

**Examples of Motives**:
- Ambition
- Jealousy
- Fear
- Greed
- Love
- Hatred

**Example Scenario**:
- Person commits theft to feed poor people
- **Motive**: Good (helping the poor)
- **Intention**: Bad (committing theft - a crime)

### 🔹 Legal Position

**Relevance**:
- Motive may be relevant to find guilt of accused
- But motive is NOT an ingredient of crime
- Good motive does not excuse crime
- Bad motive does not make lawful act criminal

**Distinction**:

| Aspect | Intention | Motive |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Definition | Aim/purpose of act | Reason behind forming intention |
| Legal Status | Essential element of crime | Not essential element |
| Nature | Proximate cause | Remote cause |
| Example | To kill | Revenge, jealousy, greed |

---

## 🚫 Exception: Strict Liability Offences

### 📘 Concept

Certain crimes do NOT require mens rea (guilty mind).

**Characteristics**:
- No particular state of mind required
- Mere commission of prohibited act sufficient
- Liability is "strict" or "absolute"

**Examples**:
- Public welfare offences
- Regulatory offences
- Statutory offences where mens rea not required

**Rationale**:
- Greater social good
- Public safety
- Deterrence
- Ease of enforcement

---

## 📊 4 Stages of Crime

### 1️⃣ **INTENTION**

**Nature**:
- First stage in commission of offence
- Mere intention alone NOT punishable
- Difficult to prove guilty mind

**Legal Position**:
- Law does NOT take notice of mere intention
- Intention not followed by any act cannot constitute offence

**Rationale**:
- Hard for prosecution to prove guilty mind
- Thought alone cannot be crime

---

### 2️⃣ **PREPARATION**

**Nature**:
- Second stage in commission of crime
- Arranging necessary measures for commission of intended criminal act

**Legal Position**:
- Intention + Preparation = NOT enough to constitute crime
- Preparation generally NOT punishable
- Difficult to prove preparations were for particular crime

**Exceptions** (Where preparation IS punishable):
- Preparation for waging war against Government
- Preparation for dacoity
- Other specific statutory provisions

**Example**:
- Buying a knife
- Watching victim's routine
- Making plan
- These are PREPARATIONS (generally not punishable)

---

### 3️⃣ **ATTEMPT**

**Nature**:
- Direct movement towards commission of crime AFTER preparation is made
- More than merely preparatory act

**Legal Position**:
- Generally PUNISHABLE
- Person guilty of attempt even if actual commission is impossible

**3 Essentials of Attempt**:

1️⃣ **Guilty Intention**
- To commit an offence

2️⃣ **Some Act Done**
- Towards commission of offence
- Must be more than preparation

3️⃣ **Act Falls Short**
- Must fall short of completed offence
- If completed, it becomes accomplishment, not attempt

**Example**:
- A aims gun at B with intent to kill
- Pulls trigger
- Gun misfires
- A is guilty of ATTEMPT to murder

**Critical Distinction: Preparation vs Attempt**:

| Preparation | Attempt |
|-------------|---------|
| Arranging means | Using means arranged |
| Remote from completion | Proximate to completion |
| Generally not punishable | Punishable |
| "Getting ready" | "Trying to do" |

---

### 4️⃣ **ACCOMPLISHMENT / COMPLETION**

**Nature**:
- Last stage in commission of offence
- Accused succeeds in his attempt

**Legal Position**:
- Guilty of **complete offence**
- Full punishment for the offence

**Example**:
- A fires at B with intention to kill
- If B dies → A guilty of MURDER (accomplishment)
- If B only injured → A guilty of ATTEMPT to murder

---

## 👥 4 Parties to Crime (Common Law Classification)

### 1️⃣ **Principals in First Degree**

**Definition**: Persons who actually committed the crime

**Characteristics**:
- Direct perpetrators
- Actually performed actus reus

---

### 2️⃣ **Principals in Second Degree**

**Definition**: Persons present at crime scene and assisted in commission

**Characteristics**:
- Present at scene
- Aided/assisted actual perpetrator
- Example: Keeping watch while another commits theft

---

### 3️⃣ **Accessories Before the Fact**

**Definition**: Persons not present at crime scene but assisted in preparing for commission

**Characteristics**:
- Not present when crime committed
- Helped in preparation/planning
- Example: Providing weapons, information, planning

---

### 4️⃣ **Accessories After the Fact**

**Definition**: Persons who helped party to crime avoid detection, escape prosecution or conviction

**Characteristics**:
- Helped after crime committed
- Assistance in avoiding justice
- Example: Harboring criminal, destroying evidence

### 🔹 Modern Classification

In modern times:
- **Principals** and their **accomplices**
- **Accessories**

**Accomplice Liability Requirements**:
- **Act**: Aiding, abetting, or assisting in commission of crime
- Words may be enough in many jurisdictions
- Mere presence without legal duty to act is NOT enough
- **Intent**: Specific intent/purposely OR general intent/knowingly
