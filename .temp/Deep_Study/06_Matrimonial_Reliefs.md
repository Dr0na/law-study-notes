## 📖 PRINCIPLES OF MATRIMONIAL LAW

### **1. Fault Theory vs. No-Fault Theory**

#### **Fault Theory:**
Traditional approach - matrimonial relief based on matrimonial offense (adultery, cruelty, desertion).

#### **No-Fault Theory:**
Modern approach - divorce based on irretrievable breakdown, mutual consent, living separately.

**Indian Position:**
Combination of both:
- Section 13(1): Fault-based grounds
- Section 13B: No-fault (mutual consent)
- Courts recognize irretrievable breakdown under cruelty

---

### **2. Irretrievable Breakdown of Marriage**

**Concept:**
Marriage has broken down beyond repair; no possibility of reconciliation.

**Not Explicit Ground:**
Not mentioned as ground in Hindu Marriage Act.

**Judicial Recognition:**
Supreme Court recognized it as ground under:
- Article 142 (constitutional power)
- Cruelty [if relationship beyond repair, amounts to cruelty]

**Important Cases:**
- **Naveen Kohli v. Neelu Kohli** (2006)
- **Samar Ghosh v. Jaya Ghosh** (2007)

---

### **3. Welfare of Child Principle**

In matters of custody:
- **Child's welfare paramount**
- Not parent's right, but child's right
- Material and moral welfare considered
- Age-appropriate arrangements

**Tender Years Doctrine:**
Young children (especially girls under 7) generally with mother unless contrary to welfare.

---

### **4. Clean Hands Doctrine**

**Principle:**
Party seeking equity must come with clean hands.

**Application:**
- Petitioner guilty of matrimonial offense may be denied relief
- Conduct of parties considered
- Discretionary relief

---

### **5. Condonation**

**Definition:**
Forgiveness of matrimonial offense.

**Effect:**
Bars relief based on that offense if parties resumed cohabitation after knowledge.

**Requirements:**
- Full knowledge of offense
- Free forgiveness
- Resumption of marital relations

---

### **6. Connivance**

**Definition:**
Consent or encouragement to matrimonial offense.

**Effect:**
Bars relief if petitioner connived at respondent's offense.

**Example:**
Husband encourages wife's adultery, then seeks divorce on that ground - relief denied.

---

### **7. Collusion**

**Definition:**
Agreement between parties to present false case or suppress defense to obtain decree.

**Effect:**
Bars relief if collusion proved.

**Example:**
Parties fabricate adultery case to obtain quick divorce - not permitted.
