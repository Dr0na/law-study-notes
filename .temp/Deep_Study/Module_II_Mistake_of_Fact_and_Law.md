### 🧩 Essential Ingredients

#### **1️⃣ Mistake of Fact**

## 📊 3 Conditions for Mistake Defense

For an accused to get protection on ground of mistake, **three conditions** must be fulfilled:

### **1️⃣ State of Things Believed Would Justify Act**

**Condition**: The state of things believed to exist would, **if true**, have justified the act done.

**Meaning**: If facts were as accused believed them to be, act would have been lawful.

**Example**:
- A believes Z is a burglar attacking
- A uses force to defend (actually Z was innocent passerby)
- **IF** Z had actually been burglar, force would be justified
- Condition satisfied

### **2️⃣ Mistake Must Be Reasonable**

**Condition**: The mistake must be **reasonable** in the circumstances.

**Meaning**: A reasonable person in accused's position would have made same mistake.

**Test**: 
- Not what accused thought
- But what a **reasonable person** would have thought in same circumstances

**Example of Unreasonable Mistake**:
- A sees B in distance and thinks B is thief
- Without checking or reasonable grounds, A shoots B
- This is unreasonable - A should have verified

### **3️⃣ Mistake Must Relate to Fact, Not Law**

**Condition**: The mistake must relate to **fact**, not to **law**.

**Meaning**: 
- Ignorance of fact excuses
- Ignorance of law does NOT excuse

**Why Law is Excluded**:
- If mistake of law allowed, every accused would claim ignorance
- Difficult for prosecution to prove accused knew the law
- Would encourage ignorance of law
- Principle: "Everyone is presumed to know the law"

---

## 🔴 Mistake of Fact vs ⚪ Mistake of Law

### **Mistake of Fact**

**Definition**: Mistake about **factual circumstances** or situation.

**Legal Effect**: **CAN be a defense** if conditions satisfied.

**Examples**:
1. Person takes someone else's property thinking it is his own
2. Police officer arrests wrong person believing he is the accused
3. Person believes spouse is dead (actually alive) and remarries

### **Mistake of Law**

**Definition**: Mistake about **what the law is** or **legal consequences**.

**Legal Effect**: **NOT a defense** (general rule).

**Maxim**: "Ignorantia juris non excusat" - Ignorance of law is no excuse.

**Examples**:
1. Person thinks bigamy is not crime (mistake about law - NO defense)
2. Person believes certain act is legal but it is not (mistake of law - NO defense)
3. Person misunderstands legal provision (mistake of law - NO defense)

---

### 📌 4 Exceptions: When Mistake of Law CAN Be Defense

In **limited circumstances**, mistake of law can serve as defense:

#### **Exception 1: Law Not Published**

**When**: The law under which person is charged was **not published**.

**Rationale**: Cannot expect person to know unpublished law.

**Case**: **R v. Bailey** - Accused was away at coast of Africa when statute passed. Could not have known about it. Court held him guilty, but this was criticized. Modern law recognizes this as valid defense.

#### **Exception 2: Statute Later Overturned or Held Unconstitutional**

**When**: Person relied upon statute that was **later declared unconstitutional or overturned**.

**Rationale**: Person cannot be blamed for following what appeared to be valid law at time.

#### **Exception 3: Relied Upon Judicial Decision**

**When**: Person relied upon **judicial decision** interpreting the law.

**Rationale**: Court's interpretation of law creates reasonable belief about what law is.

#### **Exception 4: Relied Upon Official Interpretation**

**When**: Person relied upon interpretation by **appropriate official** (e.g., government officer, legal advisor).

**Rationale**: Reasonable to rely on official guidance about what law requires.

## 🏛️ Important Case Laws

### 1️⃣ **R v. Tolson** (1889) - Leading Case on Mistake of Fact

#### **Facts**:
- Appellant married in September 1880
- Husband went missing in December 1881
- She was told husband was on ship that was **lost at sea**
- **Seven years later**, believing husband dead, she **married another man**
- First husband turned up sometime after second marriage
- Charged with offense of **bigamy**

#### **Issue**:
Whether she could claim defense of mistake of fact?

#### **Held**:
**NOT GUILTY** - She was afforded defense of mistake.

#### **Reasoning**:
1. She believed in good faith that her first husband was dead
2. It was **reasonable in the circumstances** to believe he was dead
   - Seven years had passed
   - Told ship was lost at sea
   - No word from husband for 7 years
3. This was **mistake of fact** (believed he was dead)
4. NOT mistake of law (she knew bigamy was illegal)
5. If her belief had been true (if he was actually dead), second marriage would have been lawful

#### **Principle Established**:
**Reasonable mistake of fact** can be defense if:
- Belief was honest and reasonable
- If facts were as believed, act would be lawful
- Act done in good faith

---

### 2️⃣ **R v. Prince** (1875) - Mistake Must Be Reasonable

#### **Facts**:
- Prince took a girl **below 16 years** of age
- Took her **without consent of parents**
- Believed the girl was **above 16 years**
- This is offense in England under Offences Against Persons Act, 1861

#### **Issue**:
Whether mistake about girl's age was defense?

#### **Held**:
**CONVICTED** - Mistake not a defense.

#### **Reasoning**:
1. Prince did NOT act in **good faith**
2. He **failed to make enquiries** to find out actual age of girl
3. A reasonable person would have verified girl's age before taking her
4. His mistake was **unreasonable**
5. Even though no mens rea for specific age element, convicted

#### **Principle Established**:
Mistake defense requires:
- **Reasonable mistake** (not just any mistake)
- **Due care and attention** must be exercised
- Cannot claim mistake if failed to verify facts

**Distinction from Tolson**:
- **Tolson**: Reasonable to believe husband dead after 7 years, no way to verify
- **Prince**: Unreasonable not to verify girl's age when possible

---

### 3️⃣ **R v. Bailey** - Law Not Published

#### **Facts**:
- Accused was away at coast of Africa
- A statute was passed by British Parliament
- Accused could not have known by any means about passing of statute
- Charged under that statute

#### **Held**:
Court held him **guilty**, disallowing his plea of want of knowledge of law.

#### **Criticism**:
This decision has been criticized. Modern law recognizes that:
- If law is not published or not accessible, person cannot be expected to know it
- This should be exception to "ignorance of law is no excuse"

#### **Principle**:
Generally, ignorance of law is no excuse, BUT unpublished law creates difficulty.

---

### 4️⃣ **R v. Wheat and Stock** - Mistake of Law Not Excuse

#### **Facts**:
- Accused was **illiterate**
- He was **misinformed** that he had been granted divorce
- Subsequently he remarried
- His first wife charged him for **bigamy**

#### **Held**:
Court held him **guilty** of bigamy and convicted him.

#### **Reasoning**:
1. This was **mistake of law**, not mistake of fact
2. He was mistaken about his **legal status** (whether divorced or not)
3. Ignorance of law is no excuse
4. Even though he was illiterate and misinformed, no defense

#### **Distinction from Tolson**:
- **Tolson**: Mistake of **fact** (believed husband was dead) - Defense available
- **Wheat**: Mistake of **law** (believed he was divorced) - NO defense

#### **Principle**:
**Mistake of law is NOT a defense**, even if:
- Person is illiterate
- Person was misinformed by others
- Person genuinely believed he had legal right

### **Examples with Analysis**

#### **Example 1: Protected by Mistake Defense**

**Scenario**:
- A is a police officer
- A receives information that B (wanted criminal) is in house C
- A goes to house C with warrant for B's arrest
- A arrests person thinking he is B
- Later found person was innocent D, who looks like B

**Analysis**:
- ✅ Mistake of **fact** (mistaken identity)
- ✅ **Reasonable** mistake (D looked like B)
- ✅ Done in **good faith** (A verified information, had warrant)

- ✅ A believed he was **bound by law** to execute warrant

**Result**: A protected by **Section 14 BNS** - NO criminal liability

---

#### **Example 2: NOT Protected**

**Scenario**:
- A sees B walking on road at night

- Without any verification or reasonable grounds, A attacks B thinking B is thief
- B is actually innocent person walking home

**Analysis**:
- ✅ Mistake of fact (mistaken identity)
- ❌ **NOT reasonable** mistake (no grounds to believe B was thief)
- ❌ NOT done in **good faith** (no due care - should have verified)
- ❌ Even if B had been thief, A had no right to attack without attempting arrest

**Result**: A **NOT protected** - Liable for assault

---

#### **Example 3: Mistake of Law - NO Defense**

**Scenario**:
- A is getting married
- A believes that if he registers marriage, divorce from previous wife not needed
- A marries B without divorcing first wife
