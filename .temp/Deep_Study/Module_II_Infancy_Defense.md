## 📝 Introduction

Infancy or minority is an important **general exception** under Chapter IV of BNS 2023, recognizing that children below a certain age lack the mental capacity to form criminal intent and understand the nature and consequences of their acts. The law provides complete or qualified immunity based on age, reflecting the humane principle that **childhood is a period of innocence** and children need protection and reformation, not punishment.

---

## 🔑 Fundamental Principle

### **Doli Incapax**

**Latin Term**: **"Doli incapax"**

**Meaning**: **"Incapable of wrong"** or **"Incapable of evil intent"** or **"Incapable of crime"**

**Legal Principle**: Children below certain age are **legally presumed incapable** of forming criminal intent.

**Rationale**:
- Children lack **intellectual maturity**
- Cannot understand **wrongfulness** of conduct
- Unable to appreciate **consequences** of actions
- Mind not developed to form **mens rea**

---

## 🔢 Three Age Categories

The law divides persons into **three distinct categories** based on age, with different levels of criminal responsibility:

---

## 📖 CATEGORY 1: Children Below 7 Years (Section 20 BNS)

### ⚖️ Provision (Previously Section 82 IPC)

**Section 20 BNS**: "Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under **seven years of age**."

---

### 🛡️ Legal Effect

**ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY** from criminal liability

**Key Features**:
- **Complete exemption** from criminal prosecution
- **Irrebuttable presumption** of incapacity
- Cannot be prosecuted for **any offense** whatsoever
- **No exceptions** to this rule
- Conclusive presumption - cannot be challenged

**"Irrebuttable"**: Cannot be proved otherwise - law conclusively presumes incapacity

---

### 📌 Rationale

**Complete Absence of Mens Rea**:
- Child below 7 completely lacks mental maturity
- Cannot understand nature and consequences of act
- Cannot distinguish right from wrong
- Incapable of forming criminal intent

**Doli Incapax - Absolute**:
- Absolute presumption of doli incapax
- Cannot be rebutted under any circumstances
- Even if child shows understanding, law presumes incapacity

**Humanitarian Consideration**:
- Childhood is period of innocence
- Need protection, not punishment
- Focus on care and welfare

---

### 📖 Practical Application

**Example 1**:
- Child aged 6 years takes jewelry from shop
- Cannot be prosecuted for theft
- Complete immunity under Section 20
- Even if child understands theft concept

**Example 2**:
- Child aged 5 years fires gun, causing death
- Cannot be charged with murder or culpable homicide
- No criminal liability regardless of seriousness of act
- Section 20 provides absolute protection

**Example 3**:
- Child aged 4 years sets fire to house
- Cannot be prosecuted for arson or mischief
- Absolute immunity

---

### ⚠️ Important Note

**While No Criminal Prosecution**:
- Child may be dealt with under **Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015**
- Focus on **care, protection, and rehabilitation**
- Parents/guardians may be counseled
- Child welfare measures applied

**But**: NO criminal prosecution or punishment possible.

---

## 📖 CATEGORY 2: Children Between 7-12 Years (Section 21 BNS)

### ⚖️ Provision (Previously Section 83 IPC)

**Section 21 BNS**: "Nothing is an offence which is done by a child above **seven years of age** and under **twelve**, who has not attained sufficient **maturity of understanding** to judge of the **nature and consequences of his conduct** on that occasion."

---

### 🛡️ Legal Effect

**QUALIFIED/CONDITIONAL IMMUNITY** from criminal liability

**Key Features**:
- **Presumption of innocence** (but rebuttable)
- Protection available **unless** prosecution proves maturity
- **Burden on prosecution** to show child understood act
- If maturity NOT proved, child gets immunity

**"Rebuttable Presumption"**: Can be rebutted if prosecution proves child had sufficient maturity

---

### 📌 Two-Part Test

**For child (7-12 years) to be criminally liable**, prosecution must prove:

**Test 1: Maturity of Understanding**

Did child have **sufficient intellectual development** and maturity?

**Factors Considered**:
- Level of education
- Intelligence level
- Social environment
- Previous conduct
- General demeanor

---

**Test 2: Nature and Consequences of Conduct**

Did child understand:
- **Nature** of the act he was doing?
- **Consequences** that would follow from act?

**Both Elements Required**:
- Understanding what act is
- Understanding what results from act

---

### 📊 Burden of Proof

**On PROSECUTION to prove** (beyond reasonable doubt):
1. Child had attained sufficient maturity
2. Child understood nature of act
3. Child understood consequences of act

**If NOT proved**: Child gets immunity under Section 21

**If Proved**: Child can be held criminally liable (but dealt under Juvenile Justice Act)

---

### 📌 Factors for Determining Maturity

Courts consider various factors:

**1️⃣ Nature of Act**:
- Complexity of crime committed
- Whether act shows planning/premeditation
- Degree of deliberation involved

**2️⃣ Child's Conduct**:
- Behavior before, during, and after act
- Attempts to **hide crime** (shows understanding of wrongfulness)
- Attempts to **destroy evidence**
- Giving false statements
- Showing remorse or lack thereof

**3️⃣ Individual Circumstances**:
- **Education level** (schooling, literacy)
- **Social environment** (upbringing, influences)
- **Previous conduct** (history of delinquency)
- **Mental development** (psychological assessment)

**4️⃣ Understanding of Wrongfulness**:
- Did child know act was wrong?
- Statements showing awareness
- Recognition of moral/legal wrong

---

### 📖 Practical Application

**Example 1: Immunity Applied**

**Scenario**:
- Child aged 10 takes money from parent's purse to buy candy
- Takes impulsively
- No evidence of understanding theft concept
- No planning or hiding

**Analysis**:
- ✅ Age: Between 7-12 (Section 21 applicable)
- ❌ Maturity: No evidence of understanding nature and consequences
- ❌ Prosecution cannot prove maturity

**Result**: **Immunity under Section 21** - Cannot be prosecuted

---

**Example 2: No Immunity (Maturity Proved)**

**Scenario**:
- Child aged 11 plans theft from neighbor's house
- Breaks in at night when family away
- Takes valuables, hides them carefully
- Lies when questioned
- Sells items and hides money

**Analysis**:
- ✅ Age: Between 7-12 (Section 21 applicable)
- ✅ Evidence of planning (shows understanding)
- ✅ Breaking in at night (deliberate timing)
- ✅ Hiding items (knows act is wrong)
- ✅ Lying (consciousness of guilt)
- ✅ Prosecution can prove maturity and understanding

**Result**: **Can be prosecuted** (immunity not available)

**But**: Dealt under **Juvenile Justice Act**, not regular criminal procedure.

---

### 📌 Doli Incapax Principle

**For 7-12 Age Group**:
- **Rebuttable presumption** of doli incapax
- Presumed incapable **unless** prosecution proves otherwise
- Benefit of doubt goes to child

**Test**: Has child crossed threshold of understanding?

---

## 📖 CATEGORY 3: Children Above 12 Years (& Adults)

### ⚖️ Legal Position

**No provision for immunity**

**Legal Effect**:
- **Full criminal responsibility**
- Treated as adults for criminal law purposes
- **No presumption of incapacity**

---

### 📌 Rationale

**Sufficient Mental Development**:
- By age 12, adequate mental development presumed
- Can understand nature and consequences
- Can form requisite mens rea
- Can distinguish right from wrong

---

### ⚠️ Important Note - Juvenile Justice Act

**For Persons Below 18 Years** (even if above 12):

While **criminally liable**, special laws apply:
- **Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015** governs
- Separate **juvenile justice boards**
- Different **trial procedures**
- Focus on **rehabilitation**, not punishment

**Exception for Heinous Crimes**:
- Children **16-18 years** committing **heinous offenses**
- May be tried as adults after preliminary assessment
- Board assesses mental and physical capacity

---

## 📚 Summary

**Infancy Defense** provides immunity based on **age**:

**Below 7 years** (Section 20):

- Complete protection regardless of understanding
- Doli incapax conclusively presumed

**7-12 years** (Section 21):
- **Conditional immunity** (rebuttable presumption)
- Protection unless maturity proved
- Prosecution must prove understanding of nature and consequences
- Doli incapax presumed but can be rebutted

**Above 12 years**:
